This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   In today's society schools have been given innumerable tasks to perform. Elementary schools are among the first  institutions, outside the family, to take on the task of educating the children of the future. P.S. 1 is committed to  educating each child to the highest level he/she can attain. We are dedicated to imparting the skills and knowledge  that will help each child live a fulfilling, productive life as a responsible citizen in our society. We value integrity,  partnership, initiative, and discipline and are dedicated to excellence. The success of our mission depends on the  effectiveness of teachers, parents, and administrators working together for the benefit of the children.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   Our student population consists of 25% of students who have an Individualized Education Plan. Students with IEPs are  mainly served in collaborative team teaching classes. In addition to providing differentiated instruction in the  classroom we have provided additional intervention support that is aligned to their academic area of need. Families of  students in grades 3-5 were offered an additional program after school that targeted instruction in ELA and Math.  Students in grades K-2 were also provided with literacy intervention programs afterschool to support their continued  academic needs in literacy. In addition to servicing students who require academic intervention, we were also able to  offer an enrichment program for students in grades 3-5 during the school day. We were also able to offer an  afterschool enrichment program for grades Kindergarten through grade 5. Students are engaged in STEM activities to  provide them with the additional opportunities for rigorous instruction.    According to the Learning Environment survey, there was a need for additional non-academic programs. As a result,  we have implemented these programs for our students. We have offered the following programs: fitness, legos,  drama, STEM, dance, and basketball. We have been able to offer these programs in the fall and in the spring.   In order to celebrate student achievement, teachers have worked with their grade level teams to create a common  criterion for students to become a “Reader, Writer, and Mathematician of the month. Students who have shown  exemplary gains for the month are celebrated. Once a student has been selected, they are asked to write a letter to  their class explaining what they did to earn the recognition. Their names are announced for the whole school to hear.  This same protocol is in place for Science, Art, and Physical Education. The PTA has begun a school spirit initiative in  which all students receive a PS 1 keychain and are awarded spirit sticks for recognition of birthdays, citizenship, and  good behavior. In collaboration with the PTA we are awarding students with a spirit stick for this “success”.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Based upon our recent state test data 84% of students with disabilities are below or approaching grade level  standards in ELA and 78% are below or approaching grade level in mathematics. Our ELLs are performing at 18%  proficiency according to the ELA test data and all ELL students are below or approaching grade level in mathematics.  Our ENL students are not reading at grade level therefore are lacking the comprehension ability to read the  challenging grade level text that is expected for state exams. An increase in academic vocabulary is needed to support  both our ENL students as well as our students with disabilities.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   At the center of the Framework for Great Schools is student achievement. Our school made progress in student  achievement as evidenced by our MOSL data in English Language Arts. We had 71% of students meeting or exceeding  standards according to our DRA data. Last year we only had 63% of students meeting or exceeding standards in DRA.  According to our data we need to focus our support in our early childhood grades K-1 since we only have 65% of  students meeting or exceeding standards in our DRA data. In addition our focus will be on creating meaningful  rigorous instruction for our pre-k students as we have expanded our program to include two full time pre-k classes .  We will work with teachers collaboratively to plan instruction that will prepare students for meeting the rigorous  Common Core Learning Standards. The Pre-K teachers will work collaboratively using the instructional units designed  by the DOE. We have been fortunate enough to participate in the Learning Partners Program again this school year to  support this focus area. Our intended outcome is to produce collaborative, rigorous instruction to create a supportive  environment for our students. Another focus area is formative assessment with a particular focus on self-assessment  and peer assessment. The Learning Partnership will include our host school of P.S. 5. Through careful analysis of the  common core learning standards, we noticed a significant gap in the Common Core Learning Standards in ELA and  Math that our general education and special education students need to have in order to successfully master the  content in order to fill in gaps. Our plan is to address the gaps in the standards as well as the deficits in pedagogy that  cause so many students to struggle.. Teacher collaboration and improvements to the rigor of instruction at the  elementary level will ultimately have an influence on student achievement. Collaborative planning with teachers from  our partner schools will help hone teacher skills and opportunities to learn and grow from one another. The design of   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      this partnership is strategic because it pairs us with schools that are in close geographical proximity; similar yet  diverse enough in student population and led by like-minded and motivated leaders with the work centered on the  Framework for Great Schools. We are committed to establishing rigorous instruction, collaborative teaching and a  supportive environment. We believe that this partnership will provide seamless vertical and horizontal alignment for  schools throughout the city. We will focus on the following two areas this year:     This school year we will continue to focus upon Mathematics. Our math test data indicated an increase of   12%. Our gains were in both general education students as well as special education students.

Grade level teams collaborate to design units of study that are aligned to the CCLS. Instructional shifts are embedded  into the maps/lessons and tasks. Close reading and the analysis of themes is incorporated throughout genres.  Benchmark tasks have been created to monitor student progress throughout the units. Rubrics have been revised to  align to the CCLS. Academic tasks are reviewed regularly to determine if revisions are necessary to the task or  whether additional lessons need to be addressed in the unit to support student growth. Grade level teams meet  weekly to review student work and make adjustments when necessary. Unit tests have also been revised to align to  the CCLS. Lessons and tasks have been differentiated in order to promote higher order thinking skills as well as  provide access for all learners. Professional development, intervisitations, and teacher team sessions are based upon  the use of data and the design of the curriculum and its evaluation. According to our Quality Review we were well  developed in the area of creating rigorous instruction. Across grades and subjects, we have ensured that curricula is  aligned to the shifts of the Common Core Learning Standards and emphasize higher order thinking for all students.  We are committed to the ongoing review of unit maps, lessons and academic tasks. The instructional shifts are  embedded across grades and subjects and include strategies to promote higher order thinking for all learners.   According to the NYC School Survey as well as our last Quality Review our strengths are the use of formative and  summative assessments and the way in which they are used to determine groupings and curricula revisions. This has  resulted in feedback to staff and students about students’ progress towards learning goals informing strategic and  timely instructional adjustments to curricula and instruction.

According to the NYC School Survey teachers felt they required more resources to address the common core shifts in  ELA. As a result of this data, the Ready Gen curriculum was adopted for teachers to utilize to address the need. In  addition, guided and independent reading materials were purchased for each classroom to supplement this  curriculum. In addition, it was noted that teachers were in need of materials and resources to support the Social  Studies curriculum. In order to support the need, we have adopted the Passport to Social Studies curriculum and have  resources for each grade level. Additionally, the Amplify Science program has been adopted to address the science  curriculum and resources have been purchased to implement this program.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   As evidenced by the Quality Review, our school is well developed in teacher teams and leadership development. All  teachers are engaged in robust and collaborative inquiry teams and professional collaborations that have resulted in  well-defined systems focusing on the examination of student work, curriculum mapping, academic tasks, and  assessment data. The impact of this work strong collaboration and inquiry work that have resulted in teacher  leadership, strengthened instructional capacity and improved teacher practice leading to elevated student learning.   Through careful analysis of the common core learning standards, we noticed a significant gap in the Common Core  Learning Standards in ELA and Math that our general education and special education students need to have in order  to successfully master elementary school. We had 52% of students meeting/exceeding standards according to the ELA  State Test data of 2016 and 34% of students meeting/exceeding standards in Math in 2017. Our plan is to address the  gaps in the standards as well as the deficits in pedagogy that cause so many students to struggle. As we await our  current testing data it is our goal to increase the percentage of students meeting proficiency levels in ELA and Math.  Teacher collaboration and improvements to the rigor of instruction at the elementary level will ultimately have an  influence on student achievement. Collaborative planning with teachers from our partner schools will help hone  teacher skills and opportunities to learn and grow from one another. We are committed to establishing rigorous  instruction, collaborative teaching and a supportive environment. We believe that this partnership will provide  seamless vertical and horizontal alignment for our school.

According to our Quality review, the work of the vertical and grade level inquiry teams result in positive results in  action planning that determine next steps for teaching practice. As a result of the vertical team teacher inquiry work,  teachers described how the results of benchmark tests not only guide more strategic groupings for student success,  but also guide the curricula revisions at all grade levels.   It is our intended goal to review and revise the use of our benchmark assessments. As math curriculum maps are  revised, teachers need to create benchmark assessments at two pivotal points in each unit. These benchmarks will be  analyzed to determine student success toward the Common Core Learning Standards.   According the NYC School Quaility Guide it was noted that teachers were in need of a program in the area of ELA to  address the shifts in literacy. As a result our school has adopted the Ready Gen curriculum and has developed  curriculum maps to support the teachers to develop and prepare lessons that will support instruction.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Column B   Verify with an (X)   Section Reference(s)   Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local                                                  1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 1, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student  Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the  connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed  to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of  their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and  Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      P.S. 1 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the ESSA;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

The key is for educators to understand the needs of all subgroups, specifically  our ELLs and to design instruction that meets their needs. Students will learn basic language and  communication skills that will allow them to actively participate in their classroom. The after  school program will provide specific targeted instruction using Orton-Gillingham. Using these  strategies, ELL teachers can make difficult reading comprehensible by building vocabulary,  decoding difficult syntax and teaching background knowledge. Ells will also participate in a  Readers' Theater Program to help develop oral language and literacy. Students read stories that  have been scripted like a play, and then act out the story together.   ELLs will benefit greatly  from having opportunities to read a text many times because this helps them develop fluency,  vocabulary, and comprehension. In order to understand the plot of the stories, vocabulary words  will be selected and a variety of activities and strategies will be used to make them  comprehensible. As a culminating activity Ells will act out the story in front of the class.  Students will be encouraged to use vocal, facial, and physical expression to engage with the  script and their character. Students will have opportunities to create simple props to enhance  their performance.  One certified ENL teacher and one certified Common Branch teacher will working  collaboratively to support our ELL population. They will utilize an integrated model for  instruction. The teachers will provide direct instruction utilizing a team teaching approach. The  program will consist of 30 students from Grades K to 5.  There will be two cycles planned with sessions that will run from October - April.  The sessions  will be held on Wednesday from 2:30p.m.-4:00p.m. The first cycle will be scheduled  from October 24-December 19, 2018 and will include English Language Learners in grades k, 1  and 2. The second cycle will be scheduled February 6- April 17, 2019 and will include ELLs in  grades 3, 4 and 5.Upon arrival, children will receive a light snack while being supervised.  Attendance folders will be utilized to monitor student attendance each day of service. One  administrator will be responsible for supervising the program.  The remainder of the Title III that was not utilized for Professional Development will be used to  purchase picture dictionaries, vocabulary context cards, thematic flip books and other materials  to support the program. In addition, all resources will be used to facilitate the acquisition of the  English Language and address the skills of listening, speaking, reading, and writing.  All letters sent home are translated into parent’s language of choice. Parent letters regarding the  program will be collected by the classroom teachers, and forwarded to the ENL teacher.  The  ENL teacher will be responsible for archiving the letters and for creating attendance charts for  this program.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.     rationale  teachers to receive training          schedule and duration      name of provider   topics to be covered   Begin description here:             The goal of the administration is to provide all members of our school community with  opportunities for professional development programs that support the academic gains and  English language development of all of our students including  English Language Learners and  immigrant students .

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  1    The assessment tool used to assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs is the DRA. The DRA assesses letter and sound  recognition, decoding skills, reading fluency and comprehension. We also administer assessments during the middle and end  of our units of study. From the data collected, we can gain insight into the literacy needs of our ELLs. The data that is collected  helps teachers scaffold their instruction and reach students at all levels. The students will be placed in small guided groups  based on their individual needs.    The DRA data from June 2017 shows:  - In Grade 1: 2 ELLs are below grade level; 1 ELL is approaching grade level; 3 ELLs are on grade level.  - In Grade 2: 5 ELLs are below grade level; 3 ELLs are on grade level.  -In Grade 3: 3 ELLs are below grade level; 2 ELLs are approaching grade level; 2 ELLs are on grade level.  -In Grade 4: 5 ELLs are below grade level; 1ELL is on grade level.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      -In Grade 5: 1 ELL is below grade level; 3 ELLs are approaching grade level; 1 ELL is on grade level.   Although some of our ELLs are in need of additional support based on their DRA levels, they have made progress overall as  shown by their NYSESLAT scores. From analyzing the EDAT data, our instructional focus should be on writing and speaking in  Grades K-5. This will be provided by classroom teachers, ENL teachers and additional service providers.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The ENL teacher collaborates with the classroom teacher during the administration of these assessments.  Schedules are  created to assess students with the classroom teacher.  Teacher team meetings are scheduled to analyze findings and plan  targeted instruction. Based on teacher team meetings, teachers noticed a need to strengthen decoding skills, phonemic  awareness, vocabulary development and writing skills for all grade spans but especially our ELL population. Lessons with  scaffolds are planned according to the data to reach the students at the various ability levels.  Students are placed in small  groups based upon the data collected.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The English Language Learner Baseline Assessment is being used to identify areas of need for ELLs in Grades 3-5. This  assessment is administered twice a year; once in the Fall and then again in the Spring. It provides teachers with detailed  information about their students' strengths and needs in English language development and serves as a resource to help plan  individual and group instruction. It assesses students' ability to engage with academic language that is embedded in content in  all four modalities. This allows teachers to track the progress our ELLs have made and help  determine the level and type of  instructional supports students need in order to engage with discipline-specific and grade-level academic content.   All students in Grades K-5 are administered NYC Performance Tasks (beginning of year and end of year) in ELA and Math.  These tasks are designed to promote knowledge of students, facilitate alignment to an instructional focus and develop a  culture of collaborative professional learning. Teacher created formative assessments are also administered in ELA and Math  for each unit of study. Once the results of these assessments are available, teachers will reflect on and adjust their instruction  to meet all student needs.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Summative and formative data is gathered  and then teacher team meetings including the ENL teacher, classroom teachers,  IEP teacher, literacy coach and administration occur to discuss the findings. These meetings can take place throughout the  year during common preps and teacher team meetings when the data is available. The ENL teacher  and classroom teachers  can then use the data to place children into appropriate groups where instruction will be provided with scaffolds and  differentiated to meet the student’s needs. This data also gives us insight into the progress made in each of the four  modalities. We can notice common trends, strengths and weaknesses. The data from the ELL Periodic Assessment allows us to  track the progress students are making throughout the year in grades 3-5.  This allows us to target our instruction where our  students need it the most and to continue the practices that are successful.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Our school uses data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention framework. Our first step begins during  administration of the Home Language Identification Survey when the student enters a NYC Public School for the first time.  The  ELL student also takes part in an RTI screening to asses whether his/her literacy skills and competencies are meeting grade  level benchmarks. If the student is below benchmark level or at risk, they will receive targeted instructional support in  coordination with language services. The next step in implementing the RTI model is to strengthen our core classroom  instruction so that all students have ongoing high quality opportunities to learn. Providing students with rigorous academic  content, linking their background knowledge, making everyday connections to the world and teaching through conversations  helps students meet their needs as learners. For ELL students who are not showing sufficient progress, documentation will be  analyzed to develop appropriate instructional interventions. Such documentation includes:  an explanation of how instruction  was differentiated to address native and second language concerns and cultural differences, a description of the type of ENL  instruction being received, an understanding of whether or not native language support was needed and if so to what extent,  and an identification of the instructional areas that need more intense intervention and if ENL support was needed to ensure   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         the student benefited from the intervention. Our teachers monitor student progress to determine how they are responding to  the instructional interventions. This monitoring allows them to make educational decisions about changes in goals, instruction,  and/or services; as well as whether to consider a referral for special education services.  Language development and  background are an important factor that is considered when looking at an ELL student. If a student demonstrates persistent  difficulties despite the additional support and interventions, an evaluation will be conducted.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].        After analyzing our EDAT report  which includes detailed information such as NYSESLAT proficiency and progress, ELA/Math  performance and progress, disability classification, SIFE status, years of service, etc. we can help plan and evaluate our ELL  programs.  The data collected from the 2017 NYSESLAT give us insight into planning our instruction for the upcoming school  year.  This data allows the ENL teacher to plan effective and engaging instruction that targets areas of weakness to help  promote students language growth. The ENL teacher works collaboratively with the classroom teachers to share the findings  and provide coherent instruction. From our 2017 NYSESLAT results, we noticed our students made progress from one  proficiency level to the next. Students that stayed at the same proficiency level were students who are currently receiving  special education services mandated by their IEP (Individualized Educational Plan). These children will be provided specific  targeted small group instruction. In grades 3-5 the data collected from the state ELA and Math tests will serve as an additional  planning tool. The following are the results from the 2017 ELA:  -Grade 3: 4 ELLs scored a level 2;1  ELL scored a level 3  -Grade 4: 4 ELLs scored a level 1; 1 ELL scored a level 2  -Grade 5: 2 ELLs scored a level 2; 1 ELL scored a level 3  The following are the results from the 2017 Math exam:  -Grade 3: 1 ELL scored a level 1; 4 ELLs scored a level 2; 1 ELL scored a level 3.  -Grade 4: all 5 ELLs scored a level 1  -Grade 5: 2 ELLs scored a level 1; 1 ELL scored a level 2.  From this data, we offer additional support during AIS instruction using targeted strategies based on their areas of weakness.           7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   When test scores become available, the ENL teachers work closely with school administration to review the data and make  adjustments to our program where needed.  This data includes scores from the ELA/Math exams, NYSESLAT and NYSITELL. We  analyzed the NYSESLAT and NYSITELL results and adjusted our programs to meet the mandated number of minutes as well as  provide additional AIS support services as needed. To disseminate these findings, the ENL teacher works collaboratively with  school leadership and classroom teachers during our common preps  (once a week) and during teacher team meetings on  Mondays. This gives everyone the opportunity to share ideas about the additional support that is needed to advance students  across all academic areas. The ENL teachers support classroom teachers by offering ELL strategies that they can apply in their  teaching.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.       In our Freestanding ENL program, instruction is provided through Integrated and Standalone ENL. Integrated ENL   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55         instruction uses the push-in model where the ENL teacher works collaboratively with the general education classroom  teacher. If students are at the Entering, Emerging, Transitioning and Expanding proficiency levels, they receive 180  minutes of integrated ENL. Our co-teaching model enhances student understanding of English while learning  classroom content. The classroom teacher delivers whole class instruction while the ENL teacher supports them by  offering ENL strategies that will build the English language and vocabulary skills needed for success. The ENL teacher  also provides individualized instruction, mini-lessons and conferences for individuals or small groups. Progress will be  monitored with assessments, running records, conferences.  Standalone ENL instruction uses the pull-out model for  our entering and emerging ELLs. Our entering and emerging students are homogeneously grouped  and receive their  additional 180 minutes in Stand Alone ENL.  Both the ENL and classroom teacher work together to plan engaging  lessons that are Common Core aligned and help promote student achievement. In all grade levels our school uses  heterogeneous grouping with students of mixed proficiency levels. Teachers can then differentiate and group their  students based on their specific needs and levels. . For at least 2 years from the school year in which they exist ELL  status , our Commanding students  will receive 90 minutes per week of integrated ENL services/ small group support  that monitor and support the child’s  language development and academic progress. Progress monitoring will occur in  Novemeber, January and June. If progress is not made by January, then students will be scheduled for integrated ENL  services for the remainder of the year.Evidence of progress will be monitored with assessments, running records,  conference notes and writing samples.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     b. Our school does not have a TBE program.   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      c. Our school does not have a DL program.   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?    Our school administration ensures the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels  by keeping a copy of our ENL program card.  We have two ENL teachers on staff. One is TESOL certified and the other is  certified in both TESOL and Common Branch which ensures the requirements for standalone and integrated ENL minutes are  met. Administration works closely with the ENL teachers when setting up a program schedule. Classes on each grade level are  organized strategically where ELLs are placed in the same room when appropriate to ensure that the mandated number of  instructional minutes is provided. Student data from the NYSESLAT and NYSITELL is also examined to ensure that the required  instructional minutes are met based on their proficiency levels.   All entering students will receive 360 minutes per week of  ENL services with 180 of those minutes being standalone ENL and the other 180 minutes integrated ENL/ELA. Our emerging  students also receive 360 minutes per week broken down into the appropriate amount of time for standalone ENL and  integrated ENL/ELA instructional minutes. Transitioning and expanding students receive a total of 180 minutes per week with  the appropriate breakdown between standalone and integrated services.  All commanding students receive 90 minutes of  integrated ENL/ELA instruction per week. During the ELL students ELA periods, the ENL teachers push in and co-teach to  ensure students are receving their mandated minutes of service. During our integrated and standalone models, home  language support is provided with translated materials, dual language dictionaries, staff who speak the same language and  peer support from students who speak the same language.   ELLs and former ELLS are also programmed in STARS according to  the ENL services they receive ( Stand-alone ENL /Integrated ENL ) and mandated minutes they are entitled to.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      Classroom teachers, service providers, content area teachers , special education teachers  and  ENL teachers  work  collaborately to ensure that core content is effectively delivered. Teachers use a variety of resources and materials intended to  address the diverse needs of our ELL population, in order to make language and content comprehensible.  Classroom libraries  have a variety of leveled books from many genres to support learning across the content areas.   Throughout the content   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      areas, the use of visuals (such as maps, charts, and pictures), graphic organizers (such as KWL charts and Venn diagrams) helps  teachers in making content and language accessible to our ELL students.   We are aware of the importance of building  background knowledge and by making content comprehensible through modeling, gestures, and hands-on learning, as well as  pre- teaching  important vocabulary terms, especially in the content areas of science, math, and social studies.  Content areas  are taught in English using ENL strategies. There is the additional use of bilingual dictionaries, books and photo collections  translated in several languages word-to word dual language glossaries offered in math, science and social studies, Buddy  System , paraprofessional's language assistance to support our ELLs in their native language.  The ENL program incorporates several approaches and methods to make content comprehensible and to enrich language  development. Prominent among the teaching approaches is the Natural Approach. In the Natural Approach, teachers provide  language input that learners can understand. Comprehension is facilitated by using visual aids, gestures, commands for  physical actions (e.g. Total Physical Response), sentence expansions, open-ended sentences,  prefabricated phrases, and native  language support. Native language support is facilitated through a student buddy system ( children of same language assist an  ENL in various subject areas).   Content area instruction will be presented using the Natural Approach technique. Therefore,  conceptual learning will be combined with language learning. When appropriate, the Language Experience Approach, as well  as Total Physical Response methodology will be employed in the ESL instructional program. Teachers utilize differentiated  instructional approaches so that ELL students receive the support that they need.  Our school has implemented the ReadyGen reading program, which is aligned to the Common Core State Standards. This  program has scaffolds for instruction to support ELLs built into each reading and writing lesson and provides suggested  activities to support our learners. It also contains a Scaffolded Strategies Handbook which provides teachers with additional  support for ELLs and struggling readers.  Our school has implemented Math in Focus, which is aligned to the Common Core  State Standards. This program incorporates differentiated instruction and activities. Additionally, each lesson includes  suggestions for instructional strategies to support English Language Learners.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      ELLs that are new admits to our school that have a home language of Spanish and score below proficiency level on the  NYSITELL are administered the Spanish LAB. This assessment is administered by the ENL teacher and a Spanish interpreter  within the first ten days of initial enrollment; to determine language dominance.  All ELL students in grades 3-5 are required to  take the New York State Mathematics and Science exams.  ELLs may take the mathematics and science test in English or an  alternative language - whichever better meets their linguistic needs. Currently, the New York State Department of Education  offers each of these exams in Chinese (Traditional), Haitian Creole and Spanish. The Mathematics exams are also available in  Korean and Russian. When possible, arrangements are made for the  test to be translated orally into other languages for ELLs  whose first language is one for which a written translation is not available from the New York State Department of Education.   In all classrooms including ENL standalone model and Integrated ENL/ELA  models,  students are given native language reading  materials when available. Instructional materials and books are standards-based and age appropriate.  Students native  language written work samples and oral responses  may be analyzed by the classroom teachers (ENL teachers, classroom  teachers, Special Education teachers) with assistance from paraprofessional that are fluent in the child's home language.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status      We have no SIFE students currently enrolled and have not in the past. Students with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE) are  ELL students born in a country other than the United States  who enter the English Language School System in grade 3 or  above, have had two years less schooling than their peers in their native countries, and function at least two years below  expected grade level in reading and mathematics. If a child is admitted to the school and there are indications that the student  has had an interruption or inconsistency in their formal schooling the SIFE identification process will be followed. A qualified  pedagogue will administer the SIFE Oral Interview Questionnaire. The interview will be conducted in English and in the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      student's home language by a qualified translator/interpreter. If the results of the SIFE Oral Interview Questionnaire indicate  the student is a potential SIFE the Multilingual Literacy SIFE Screener (MLS) will be administered in the student's home  language by a qualified pedagogue. Interview notes, academic and assessment history, and work samples are to be collected  and maintained in the student's cumulative record folder. If the results of the MLS indicate the student is a SIFE, a writing  screener will be administered to determine the student's basic writing skills in his or her home or primary language.  If SIFE  status is determined, the school will place this student, if possible in a classroom that has another child whom speaks the same  language. We will also place this student in the appropriate ENL group to make sure required minutes are met. The student  will be able to use the English they have and also increase their proficiency through targeted small group instruction in their  classroom as well as with the ENL teacher. Both the classroom and ENL teacher will work closely to incorporate language  building skills, real world photographs/objects and individualized instruction to meet their needs. Resources are available on  the NYSED website for schools to use with their SIFE students. These resources include: the SIFE Oral Questionnaire and  Guidance, the Multilingual Literacy SIFE Screener (MLS) assessment portal and guidance, a Writing Screener, a Frequently  Asked Questions document and a SIFE Identification flow chart. They are also releasing a SIFE ELA Foundational Low Literacy  Curriculum to meet the needs of our SIFE students.Newcomer: Newcomers, participate in our Freestanding ENL program  where they receive the mandated number of minutes based on their proficiency levels. When possible they  are placed in  classes with students who speak the same native language. In all classrooms leveled reading programs are used and small  group instruction is implemented to focus on particular strategies or skills that build language development.  Our students  take part in the Wilson Fundations Program that provides additional reinforcement of phonics, phonemic awareness and other  early literacy skills. In addition, some staff members are trained in Orton Gillingham and incorporate their practices in their  daily teaching as well. Technology is incorporated throughout the day by use of smartboards, laptops and i-pads. There are  also many software programs used in the classroom that can be used at home. Students are given the opportunity to  participate in after school programs in ELA and Math. Developing: Our developing ELLs participate in our Freestanding ENL  program where they receive the mandated number of minutes based on their proficiency levels.  From looking at our  NYSESLAT data, our developing students require additional support in reading and writing. They receive their mandated  integrated ENL minutes and work in small groups. The ENL teacher collaborates with the classroom teacher to create goals for  these students. We use individualized data to create assessments and practice exams for these students. Programs like MYON  and Reading A-Z allow our students to build reading skills and vocabulary while working at their own level. Students can also  log in at home to use the materials and resources with their families. Students may also receive services in our AIS program  where targeted instruction is  designed to strengthen their literacy, math and content area skills.Long term: We currently do  not have any students that have been continuously enrolled in an ENL program for 7 or more years. However, if we did they  would receive instruction based on their areas of need. The classroom teacher and ENL teacher would analyze their data and  work together to create targeted lessons that address their areas of weakness. Small group instruction would include  scaffolding techniques to ensure they are successful in completing required tasks.Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ENL  status: Our former ENL students are entitled to 90 minutes of integrated ENL instruction and are eligible for certain specified  testing modifications for 2 years after they pass the NYSESLAT. The ENL teacher works collaboratively with the classroom  teacher to discuss any areas of weakness or concern. Commanding ELLS  will receive 90 minutes per week of integrated ENL  services/ small group support that monitor and support the child’s  language development and academic progress. Progress  monitoring will occur in November, January and June. If progress is not made by January, then students will be scheduled for  integrated ENL services for the remainder of the year.Evidence of progress will be monitored with assessments, running  records, conference notes and writing samples.       6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   We use different instructional programs to target specific needs of our ELL-SWDs. “Visualizing and Verbalizing” and “Talkies”  are two programs that the ENL teacher and some classroom teachers use to develop language comprehension. The students  learn how to connect to and interpret meaning for both oral and written language. These programs enhance the ability to  recall facts, understand main idea, infer, conclude, predict and evaluate. Our classrooms are set up with programs and apps for  our Smartboards and I-pads that allow all of the ELL subgroups to improve their language skills through the use of technology.  Some programs implemented in the classroom are Raz Kids, Learning A-Z and MYON. Students can log on to these programs to  view content based materials at their individualized levels. These programs also offer materials in Spanish which helps support   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      their native language. The content areas are also taught using hands on activities in addition to a variety of visuals.  Adminsitration and teachers work together to ensure that ELL-SWDs are receiving all services that are mandated on their IEPs.  Scheduling is done strategically to guarantee all mandated minutes are met and that students are placed in the appropraite  program based on their level of proficiency. The ENL teacher collaborates with special education teachers to plan engaging  lessons that are aligned to the standards and provide appropriate support to help students meet their grade level goals. Our  teachers use programs like Readers Theater where ELLs can role-play and practice speaking and reading in English. The  Common Core Companion is used when planning instruction to ensure accommodations are made for our ELL-SWDs.         7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  To guarantee that our ELL-SWDs needs are met within the least restrictive environment; ICT classes and SETTSS programs are  in place. These programs allow the maximum amount of time in the general education setting. The School Based Support Team  along with the IEP team carefully review the ELL-SWDs IEP. Students are then placed in the appropriate setting mandated by  their IEP. This ensures they receive all mandated services and accommodations. As per the individual student's IEP , some ELL- SWDs are placed in an ICT class .  ELL-SWD students are programmed in ICT classes where they are mainstreamed with the  general population and receive further academic, social and linguistic support, which offers them opportunities to learn in the  least restrictive environment. The ENL teacher works with other related service providers as well as the classroom teacher to  ensure students receive all mandated services without conflict. These students may also receive additional support from our  AIS and SETSS providers.   Targeted small group instruction is designed to strengthen their literacy, math and content area  skills.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Targeted intervention programs are provided for our Newcomers in Grades K-5  as well as ELLs in testing grades in English.  Small group instruction is implemented for guided reading, writing and math. Programs such as Lindamood Bell help students  learn how to connect to and interpret meaning for both oral and written language. It enhances the students’ ability to recall  facts, understand main idea, infer, conclude, predict and evaluate. The components of the program are utilized during small  group instruction to target reading and listening comprehension, memory, oral vocabulary, critical thinking and writing. The  Orton-Gillingham Reading program also targets students individual literacy needs. Through this approach students get  individualized instruction to help them in reading, spelling and writing. Trained pedagogues are implementing the program  with struggling ELLs daily. We have a School Enrichment Model program for all students in grades 3-5. This program allows  students to study one content related topic (science/social studies) in depth for ten weeks. ELLs in Grades 3-5 are also invited  to attend after school programs for literacy and math. In the lower grades Fundations is used for whole class and small group  instruction. The Orton-Gillingham approach is also used in small group instruction to target our Newcomer's needs.  New ELL  students are encouraged to use their native language as often as needed to aide in the transfer of language skills.  Tools such  as picture dictionaries, bilingual dictionaries, and translated resources can help students build oral and written skills in  English.          9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?     Our school is currently using the ReadyGen Literacy Program. This literacy program is correlated to Webb's Depth of  Knowledge (DOK) levels of reading, the Common Core State Standards and the Wilson Fundations program already in place.  The program is utilized in Grades K-5 and has a component geared specifically for ELLs. ReadyGen gives our ELL students the  accessibility to complex texts and tasks. Our ENL students will be supported through the use of modeling, scaffolding and close  reading strategies. Integrated intervention is included for skills improvement and intensive remedial instruction when  needed.  The Scaffolded Strategies Handbook provides teachers with additional support for ELLs and struggling readers.  Based  on data and  trends from the NYSESLAT and ELA, we have found that a percentage of our students struggle with reading and  writing. This year will be implementing the Orton-Gillingham reading approach and strategies to support our students in these  areas. Using these strategies, ELL teachers can make difficult reading comprehensible by building Tier 2 vocabulary, decoding  difficult syntax and teaching background knowledge. Beginning in September of this year our school will also be   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      departmentalized in grades 4 and 5 for English Language Arts and Math. ELL teachers will plan and program our students  accordingly.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   No bilingual program has been available.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All students, including ELLs, are given the opportunity to attend after school programs that are offered in our school. Letters  are sent home to notify parents of the after school programs, what they include and the dates they will be given. These letters  are sent home in the student’s native language and phone calls home explaining the program further are made if needed.  After school programs currently offered at our school are UAU, test prep, literacy, Orton-Gillingham and enrichment and the  Title III after school  Literacy program. If a student is unable to pay for a program the school will work with the family to give  the student the opportunity to attend. The programs we select will  provide enriched learning experiences and higher learning  standards for all children. Programs will have high levels of engagement and the use of enjoyable and challenging learning  experiences that are constructed around students' interests, learning styles, and preferred modes of expression. During the  school day, all students in grades K-5 participate in various music, dance and art programs.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Our English Language Learners  receive constant exposure to technology in the classroom  through the use of SmartBoards,  laptop computers, visual aids and I-pads. I-pads and computers have programs and applications set up to support ELLs  language growth. One of the programs we use is MYON. It is an online based literacy program that can be used by students in  class or at home. This program offers content based E-books for students to read on various different levels. This helps build  academic vocabulary and background knowledge for content based subject areas. All of our students, including our ELLs  receive an individual code for this program. Other programs implemented in the classroom are Raz-Kids and Learning A-Z.  These programs offer content based E-books in differentiated reading levels as well as in Spanish to aid in native language  support. Teachers can use these programs on their Smartboards so children have enlarged visuals. They can also pick  appropriate resources based on their topics of study. Each classroom library is stocked with many leveled books in an  assortment of genres to ensure students have the opportunity to read a variety of books at their specific reading levels to  support their learning across the content areas. Content areas are taught in English using ENL strategies. The use of bilingual  dictionaries,  picture dictionaries, photo collections with mulilingual translations, thematic flash cards , as well as word-to  word  dual language glossaries are offered across the content areas to provide native language support.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?    Our school has a Freestanding ENL program model. We currently do not offer a Dual Language or Bilingual program. To keep  our parents up to date and informed on school news, notices are sent home in their preferred language of communication. We  understand the importance of offering many opportunities for ELLs to use their native language as a foundation of English  language acquisition and development. Although instruction is provided in English in our Freestanding ENL program,  newcomer ELL students are encouraged to use their home language when needed. If possible they are paired with another  student that speaks the same language. This student can help support them throughout the day and help ease the transition  into classroom expectations and activities. Books in their native language are also available for the students to borrow and  take home. They are also encouraged to use their native language for writing. Dictionaries and/or translators can assist in  translating the piece into English. Materials and resources for math can also be sent home in the child’s native language.In  addition, students in Grades 3-5 are entitled to take state assessments in Math and Science in their home language. The Math,  Science and Social Studies assessments are translated into the following languages:Chinese, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian  and Spanish. In the event that a students home language is not available (Arabic, Albanian, and Sinhalese), arrangements will  be made for an interpreter to translate the test orally.         14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         Students receive all required services and resources by grade, age and English ability. All classroom materials are aligned to the  students current reading levels, content area and proficiency level as an ELL. The ENL teacher receives curriculum maps that  are aligned to the Common Core Standards for each grade as well as resources. The ENL teacher works with the classroom  teacher to create entry points for all learners. Small group instruction with scaffolded lessons and strategies such as sentence  starters, graphic organizers, front loading of vocabulary, etc. to ensure all students are successful in meeting grade level tasks.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Currently our school does not share a building.         16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Newly enrolled ELL students that have attended Pre-K in our school are introduced to the ENL teacher before the beginning of  the school year. They have the opportunity to meet with the ENL teacher and receive summer activities that can offer English  language support. Parents of newly enrolled ELLs are invited to attend workshops where interpreters  will be provided if  needed. We have a kindergarten orientation for parents to welcome them to the school and curriculum meetings for all  grades. The ENL teacher also holds an ELL Parent Orientation at the beginning of the school year or when new admits arrive.  During parent engagement time on Tuesdays, teachers meet with parents to discuss their child's language development.  On  our school website, parents can see upcoming activities, the curriculum for the year by grade and all school notices. Parents  receive a welcome packet at the beginning of each school year with information regarding school policies and procedures. The  PTA invites all parents to their meetings where they are afforded opportunities to ask questions and receive information and  assistance. Our parent coordinator is also available to assist parents that may have questions or concerns about the upcoming  year. Families of students who are ELLs/SWDs are contacted by the Special Education Support Staff members to provide an  opportunity for questions and answers.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    19. Our school does not currently offer any language electives.      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?    Our school does not have a dual language program.        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The goal of the administration is to provide all members of our school community with opportunities for professional  development programs that support the academic gains and English language development of all of our students including  English Language Learners and immigrant students. All staff members are encouraged to attend outside professional  development session offered by the district and outside agencies to ensure that they will be able to assist our ELLs and  immigrant students in all academic areas.       Our Staten Island Field Support Center, along with the DELLSS offers Professional Development opportunities to all teachers  who work with ELLs throughout the year. On Monday afternoons during professional development the ENL teachers also  collaborate with the UFT Teacher Center for Professional Learning to provide classroom teachers, service providers and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61         paraprofessionals with professional development to ensure that they understand the stages and process of language  acquisition, along with the various cultural and native language transfer factors that can impact the process. Additionally, the  UFT Teacher Center will provide coaching support to ENL teachers in order to create a lab site for all teachers to observe and  do inter-visitations.  Another goal is provide staff with support in understanding ENL methodologies and strategies, with an  emphasis on the importance of providing ELLs with background knowledge and scaffolds to support their academic language  proficiency needed to help ELLs and immigrant students grow and progress towards meeting Common Core State Standards.  Bloom’s Taxonomy across the stages of language acquisition is also provided to support our ELLs language acquisition.  Professional development will positively impact the progress of English Language Learners while strengthening teacher  pedagogy. Teachers will continue to gain knowledge and their repertoire of strategies to meet the needs of all students,  including the ELL population.  Teachers understand how essential it is to implement multiple entry points as well as scaffolds  and supports in order to address various learning styles and subgroups. Providing strong student supports will lead to student  achievement and an overall increase in graduation rates while also preparing students to be College and Career ready. A  professional development schedule is maintained by our administration and our school staff is required to sign in at all  conferences to verify attendance.      During the 2018-2019 school year, our ELL coordinator and ENL teachers will continue to attend Professional Development  Sessions offered. In the fall the ENL teacher team will present the English Language Learner Data Analysis Tool (EDAT) to the  staff in order to help teachers understand the data, create an understanding of the various levels of English Language Learners,  and help to address skills targeted to specific students.  All teachers received a copy of the GO TO Strategies: Scaffolding Options for Teachers of English Language Learners by Linda  New Levine, Laura Lukens, and Betty An.       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  To meet the 15% of total hours of ELL professional development for all teachers, the workshops listed above are set up on  Monday afternoons. Training sessions are also offered to help teachers incorporate ELL strategies in their classrooms.  The ENL  teacher also attends additional ENL meetings offered throughout the year to reach the 50% of total hours. Some of these  meetings include workshops held by the UFT Teacher Center and Borough Field Support Center. These meetings include topics  such as: New ENL Progressions, Scheduling & Programming for ELLs, Differentiating Instruction and Assessment for ELLs and  ELL students with disabilities. The ENL teacher also attends professional development for ELL related topics such as: the ELL  Identification process, NYSESLAT/NYSITELL testing training/updates, and LAP and LTI assistance. Records for professional  development activities are kept in the ELL Critical Documents Binder with the agenda and attendance.        Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Our school provides for individual meetings with parents of ELLs throughout the school year to discuss the goals of the  program, their child's language development progress, their child's English language proficiency assessment results and  language development needs in all content areas . On Tuesday afternoons the ENL teacher can meet with parents during our  set parent involvement time. Communication logs are maintained by all staff members. The ENL teacher can hold individual  conferences, set up meetings or sit in on parent meetings with classroom and content area teachers. Meetings with parents  can be set up as needed to discuss student language development progress, assessment results, and individual goals. We also  hold student led conferences each spring. These conferences allow our students to showcase their work from the year.  If  translation is needed, the Translation and Interpretation Unit can be used for any conference or meeting scheduled  throughout the school year. School-based staff can also be utilized for interpretation as well.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62         2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  Our school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support  of the education of their children.  Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team and Parent  Association.ELL Parents are invited to attend many academic and social activities that take place at our school such  as:-     Publishing parties: Teachers invite parents to visit the classroom to read their child’s published writing piece at the end  of a unit. This helps to foster an environment where the school partners with families to reach the expectations of the  Common Core and those set by the school community. -     Holiday fairs-     Special assemblies where students perform-     PTA  meetings-     Open school week-     Class trips- Curriculum conferences: Parents are invited to additional parent meetings twice  a year, once at the beginning of school in September and once towards the end in May. These meeting allow parents to  articulate with their child’s teacher, to go over the curriculum and student expectations during each unit.    Our Parent Coordinator serves as a liaison between the school and families.  Our parent coordinator is always available to  answer any questions that parents might have. The parent coordinator ensures that all parents receive information about  upcoming events and ways to become involved in their preferred language. The parent coordinator arranges interpreters to be  available for our academic and social activities that take place. The Translation and Interpretation Unit is available for staff to  utilize for individual conferences. Translation services can assist staff in translating documents that contain critical information  for parents. Outside vendors are hired for interpretation when needed.  Our parent coordinator arranges for different agencies  to provide workshops and services to support our ELL parents. One organization,Health Plus/ Blue Cross, comes to the school  to speak to parents about receiving health insurance for themselves and their children. They also offer workshops on various  health topics. Our school also partners with our local library. Teachers work with the library to have content related materials  set aside for parents to have easy access. This allows parents to access materials to use with their children at home that aligns  with the topics covered in class. Our library also offers many parent workshops on technology as well as free English classes.  Information on these classes are sent home to parents in their home language. We are currently in the process of creating an  adult ENL class which will be offered to all ELL parents in our school community. This program will be available to help parents  with communication skills. Dates and times will be determined based on the number of parents attending. We are also  currently looking into an outside organization to provide ELL PDs to support our parents and help build stronger ties.       Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Grace Silberstein, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PS 1 The Tottenville School                                                                              School DBN: 31R001  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      1.  Our school uses various data and methodologies to assess language preferences of our parent   community. Part II of the Home Language Survey is used to determine our parents preferred language of  communication in both oral and written form. The RAPL report can be run in ATS to determine the adult  preferred languages in our school community.
