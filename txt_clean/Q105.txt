The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7     In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           8       NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           10      Section 4: SCEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The mission of P.S./M.S. 105Q is to utilize all available resources to prepare students to meet high quality, challenging  standards of excellence. It is our goal to put on students on the pathway to success by preparing students for College  and Career; we instill the habits that are necessary for academic and social achievement. Our positive attitude fosters  a climate that motivates both staff and students to perform with enthusiasm! Each day our students are engaged in  learning the Common Core Standards as we prepare them to be college and career ready. Our staff and  administration work hard to bridge the gap between school, family, and community through trips, school events, and  parent workshops. It is on this statement that we build our educational foundation and philosophy for all our  students.         2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Our school is Pre-Kindergarten to Grade 8 located in Far Rockaway, New York. 66% of the children who attend the  school are African American, 28% Hispanic and 5% are Caucasian and Asian. This diversity helps to create a rich,  cultural environment. There are forty classes in the school that are grouped heterogeneously with the exception in  the middle school where this year we will group by gender and in grades three to six will be departmentalized  according to content . Statistically our schools population is an at-risk population; we continuously strive to close the  achievement gap by providing an engaging positive learning environment for our students.   Our instructional focus this year is: “Engaging students in authentic content and text-based discussions”. Our  instructional focus calls for students to be genuinely involved in conversations that foster questioning for deeper  understanding. Teachers model how to ask thought-provoking questions; students are expected to use these  techniques in their group discussions. Student engagement in discussion involves varied student-to-student  interaction and learning. This is accomplished through strategies such as Turn n Talk, Save the Last Word, and partner  reading. Students are being prepared for College and Career, one such successful habit is implementing self- assessment. Teachers have access to a variety of materials for instruction including computers and software via the  UFT Teacher Center and the Robin Hood Library.    One of our strengths is professional learning opportunities. We are committed to raising the level of expertise and  expand content knowledge of the staff. As a result, our professional learning opportunities ensure that all educational  and professional needs of the staff are met. Our Professional Learning Committee meets and discusses the needs of  staff members, as they are key stakeholders in their own learning. Staff needs assessment surveys are conducted  throughout the year to plan professional learning opportunities. Each Monday, quality professional development is  tailored to meet those needs. Additionally, our UFT Teacher Center, serves as a professional development support to  the school. Its primary goal is to promote teacher excellence and student achievement. The UFT Teacher Center  specialist supports the administrators’ professional development initiatives, provides in-classroom support, plans and  conducts differentiated workshops for teachers and parents; coaches individual teachers on researched-based  classroom strategies practices; and engages them in research based literature that expands their pedagogical  knowledge. For the 2018-2019 school year we will be utilizing our Universal Literacy Coach in grades kindergarten  through grade two. The Universal Literacy Coach will be visiting classrooms and supporting teachers as well as  students in efforts to close the achievement gap. The Universal Literacy Coach will provide Professional Learning  Opportunities for staff in grades kindergarten through grade two.   Each month we engage in other professional learning through our teacher teams. During our team meetings, all staff  is actively involved in looking at student work, designing formative assessments and discussing implications for  instruction and deciding on the steps that will take the student to the next level.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           11      All teachers are encouraged and selected to attend off-site professional development given by the DOE, the UFT  Teacher Center and/or other contracted organizations. All are expected to turnkey the information to the staff during  Monday and Tuesday PDs. This year, as in former years, our staff collaborates and shares best practices with each  other in order to build capacity and improve their pedagogical skills.   The administrators, Teacher Center Specialist, conduct monthly parent workshops. Some of the professional learning  opportunities are geared toward our Literacy and Mathematics programs, Next Generation Standards, NYS  Assessments, Special Education, English Language Learners, Social and Emotional aspects, Senior Requirements, and  Internet Safety. It is encouraging to see the level of collaboration and commitment to professional learning from the  staff. Therefore, we will continue to improve our level of expertise in all academic and social areas.   One of our greatest accomplishments this year was the growth in writing. We were afforded the opportunity to be a  part of the 100 School Initiative with Teachers College Writing. The students' exuberance and love of writing is evident  school-wide.    We have some challenges that have been addressed in the past but continue to prevail today. The community as  whole is still recovery from the effects of Hurricane Sandy. Another challenge is engaging parents and families, though  ongoing and continuing outreach efforts are made by our parent coordinator. We will continue to reach out to  parents and invite them in to the school to meet with teachers on Tuesdays during the designated parent  engagement time and at other convenient times.    As a team we continuously strive to provide our students with the tools they need to be college and career ready. We  are always learning together to improve our knowledge and craft to meet the needs of our students. Although we  made the most progress over the past year in the element of Rigorous Instruction from the Framework for Great  Schools, we continue to focus on this for this school year. We wholeheartedly believe in our school mission statement  which states that we utilize all available resources to prepare all students to meet high quality challenging standards  of excellence.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Our Special Education population continues to grow and make very little progress. In math and ELA they have not  reached their AYP. Upon analyzing the data they continue to lack some basic skills to close the gap. Our English  Language Learners (ELL) comprises 6% of our population, while students with disabilities (SWD) make up 27%. We  have ICT classes on every grade K-8, we have 10 self-contained classes.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   One of our greatest accomplishments this year was in Rigorous Instruction. We have shown growth in our Fountas  and Pinnell Levels. We attribute this to providing small group instruction using Leveled Literacy Instruction of students  across the grades everyday. We will continue to focus on rigorous instruction for this school year.                   2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           12      School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 27Q105   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05,06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   815   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Teachers develop and ensure that unit and lesson plans used include data-driven instruction  (DDI) protocols that are appropriately aligned to the CCLS and NYS content standards and  address student achievement needs.  The school leader and teachers have developed a comprehensive plan for teachers to partner  within and across all grades and subjects to create interdisciplinary curricula targeting the  arts, technology, and other enrichment opportunities.  Teachers implement a comprehensive system for using formative and summative  assessments for strategic short and long-range curriculum planning that involves student  reflection, tracking of, and ownership of learning.   3.3   3.4   3.5   SOP(s)   Addressed   X   X               Part 1b.

Indicate the data trends, source and year.   ● Analysis of the School Quality Guide for 2017-2018 for Student Achievement indicates that PS/MS 105 students are  approaching the target. The School Quality Guide identifies that we are approaching the target on the ELA CCLS. One of  our challenges remains writing across the Core Content areas. Although we have made strides with a focus on writing  we still need to continue to improve in this area.    ● Based on a proficient rating on the 2017-2018 Principal Performance Observations and the Diagnostic Tool for School  and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Self- Reflection with District Oversight we identified 1.2 Teacher Pedagogy as our area  of need. While there is rigorous instruction engaging all students, it is not consistent across all classrooms. Teacher  teams will meet consistently to plan and refine rigorous lessons that results in more rigorous engaging lessons. There is  also a lack of teacher understanding in the use of data to effectively plan lessons that take into account student needs  and leads to college and career readiness.    ● One of our strengths is 1.4 school culture based on the Quality Review 2016-2017 and Principal Performance  Observation for 2017-2018, where there is a mutual trust and positive attitudes amongst staff that supports the  academic and personal growth of students and adults.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           15              Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Rigorous Instruction.

According to the 2017-2018 Learning Environment Survey,:   ● 92% of parents agree that teachers outreach to them which is a decrease from previous year of 2%   ● 97% of parents agree that there is parent -teacher trust   ● 94% of parents agree that there parent -principal trust   ● 88% of parents agree that there is parent involvement in the school   * 87% of families say that they get opportunities to visit their child's classroom, such as observing instruction or  participating           2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           34      According to our DTSDE - Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness self-reflection indicates that there is still  need to strengthen the home-school partnership in order to support student achievement.   Students’ success is fostered by parental/family involvement. Our parent involvement is lower than we would like. Our  priority need is to have more families engage in and take advantage of school resources and workshops to support their  child at home.    Our goal is to have more families involved in school events; such as Career Day, Parent Workshops, College and Career  Readiness events, individual grade celebrations, Curriculum Night, Student of the Month, Awards Night, where we invite  parents and members of the community to present their professions to the students. Career Day / Empowerment Day  receive great feedback among students and parent/community presenters. We plan to continue this tradition and  expose our students to the varied professions awaiting them when they graduate. We will also continue to outreach  during Tuesday Parent Engagement sessions.    We will continue to reach out to families to keep them informed of their child’s progress in academics as well as their  socio-emotional well-being. One of our strengths is knowing our students; we have initiated “Team 3”; staff selects  three students to check-in daily with to make sure they are on the pathway to College and Career success.

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/information,  early intervention services, etc.).  In order to achieve smooth transition, administrators and teachers must work to ensure program continuity by  providing an age-appropriate curriculum within all early childhood grades. To facilitate opportunities for  communication and cooperation throughout the year a variety of continuity and transition activities will be planned  to support the “moving-on” experience. These experiences will be provided for staff, children and parents from  Community Based Organizations, Public School Pre-Kindergartens and Special Education Pre-Schools as follows:   Ongoing Communication for Staff   ● establish a community-wide Pre-Kindergarten Advisory Committee that meets bi-monthly to develop plans and  materials (including registration information) to be used in the transition process by all Pre-Kindergarten programs    ● invite staff of the preschool and kindergarten programs to participate in exchange visits   ● establish and implement joint in-service professional development sessions, meetings and discussions focused on  transition, curriculum and instructional practices   ● Pre-Kindergarten teachers will develop a list of competencies/skills that Pre-Kindergarten children will come away  with when they complete the year and begin kindergarten.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           46        A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           47      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS/MS 105, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       PS/MS 105 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           48      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association, as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on the  proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input. To increase and  improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support and ongoing professional  development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator to serve as a liaison between the school and families. The Parent Coordinator will  provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will  work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also  maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           49      ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Elementary and Secondary (ESSA) Act;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association and Title I Parent  Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;      School-Parent Compact (SPC)   PS/MS 105, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is  implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between  the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I,  agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for  improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure  that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

Overall,  the goal is to raise students’ academic achievement and help Limited English Proficient (LEP)  students attain English proficiency. In an attempt to offer additional support for our ELLs to  achieve English proficieny, meet promotional standards, and the common core standards we will  continue our ENL after school program.       The after school program for ELL students will target all ELL subgroups and grade levels.  The targeted ELL population for this after school program will be for current and former ELLs in  grades 3 through 8.  All subgroups will be served; newcomers, long term, and SIFE ELL  students.  Those to be served are newcomers, less than 3 years in school, students receiving  services 4 to 6 years, long term ELLs who have completed 6 years, and ELLs identified as  having special needs.        The ELL after school program will take place from November 9, 2018 through March 23,  2019; for 1.5 hours each day. The program will be on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:20 to  3:50. We will have a total of 3 groups, 3rd and 4th grade, 5th and 6th grade, and 7th and 8th  grade. The program will run for a total of 18 weeks. The language of instruction will be English  with native language support.  We will have three (3) teachers who are certified ENL/Bilingual  instructors. The teaching positions for ENL teachers, as always, will be made available to PS/MS  105 staff first then we will open it up to teachers within the district. This is in attempt to have all  ENL/Bilingual certified teachers for the after school program.        A variety of instructional tools will be utilized.  The type of materials used will be Imagine  Learning  to support the instructional program.  We will also use iReady, Myon, and Mathletics  to support the literacy & math program. We will use Picture dictionaries, thesauri, websites,  notebooks, chapter books, leveled readers, and prepared lessons to enhance students deficiency  in their language modalities (listening, speaking, reading, and writing) according to data from  NYSESLAT scores. We will use various differentiating techniques during instruction to  accommodate all our ELLs.  There will be a high concentration on developing and reinforcing  the use of academic language for our ELLs, especially our long term ELLs. We will employ  scaffolding techniques during student activities to meet all ELLs needs. Newcomers, SIFE, and  long term ELLs can receive an abridged version of text to ensure deeper knowledge. Teachers  will refer to IEPs when planning for ELLs with Special Needs (SWD).                 2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           55         Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.     rationale  teachers to receive training          schedule and duration      name of provider   topics to be covered   Begin description here:               The rationale for the planned professional development is to educate and prepare teachers with  necessary ENL strategies and methodologies needed to support language development. We will  focus upon the four modalities taught for the NYSESLAT, listening, reading, writing, and  speaking. Teachers will review Data Analysis AMAO and discuss what they have learned. They  will also brainstorm ways to best meet the needs of each ELL students. All staff development  focuses on rigor and relevance to the students and teachers work as a team; both horizontal and  vertical to plan accordingly. The ENL teachers working the Title III program will also attend  professional development workshops through the Division of English Language Learners and  Student Support , listed below, to increase their capacity to effectively provide supplemental  instruction. The ENL teacher will attend workshops given by DELLSS  as indicated below. The  ENL teacher will attend monthly PD meetings offered by the DOE and turnkey information. PD  sessions that are held will include agendas and attendance sheets for all in attendance.

The school has planned special events for children  and their families such as the  9/11 Memorial Museum,  Pre-reading and Pre-writing workshops,  YMCA Health/Life programs, a Character Costume party, Unity night, Bowling, Holiday party,  and more. Parents have also been invited to attend the Poetry Café, Thanksgiving Luncheon,  Winter Holiday Show, PS/MS 105 Talent Show, the GED/TASC Program and  a Mother's Day  Celebration.  Invitations are sent home with students, as while as posted on the monthly school  calendar in English and the parents' native languages.  Parent and community involvement is  paramount to the success of ELL students.  Classroom teachers are encouraged to work  collaboratively with parents to ensure that they best meet the needs of ELL students.  The ENL  teachers hold monthly Tuesday afternoon meetings for parents, to educate them on the programs  available to ELL students including their parent choice options to place the children either in a  bilingual or dual language program. In addition to these activities, we hold parent orientation  sessions on how data affects their children and how to improve instruction.  The Parents  Association also conducts weekly workshops, sent home on a monthly calendar in the students'  home languages and English. Parents are encouraged to attend the workshops and meet other  parents as well.   Translation and interpretation assistance will be made available during all  parent activities that are related to Title III through the DOE Language Access Translation and  Interpretation Unit. We also have a list of teachers/staff that are available to translate documents  and/or interpret. The parent coordinator and ENL teachers will maintain records of all  invitations, agendas, and attendance sheets to all activities.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  As per September 2017s plans, all students will be assessed using the TCRWP Running Records to assess, track and monitor  students' progress. We also use Ready Gen end of unit assessments. Teachers use the findings of this data to drive their  instruction and differentiate based on the needs of the students.  Teachers also meet to disseminate data and plan future  instruction.  The data indicates that ELLs who are proficient in their L1 do better at grasping the material and seem to progress  more quickly.  The data helps teachers plan for RTI tiers of learning and/or instruction. We have implemented Teachers College       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           60      writing program and the teachers use the Teachers College units of study assessment to assess their students literacy skills. 6-8  grade teachers use Code X end of unit assessments and also use Performance Series.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The PS/MS 105 family have Professional Development on TC writing and  formative assessment consistently throughout  the  school year. The ENL teachers and classroom teachers also use teacher created assessments along side the  NYSESLAT and/or NYSITELL to assess growth in language proficiency. Assessments are done every 3 months to measure  progress.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We evaluate the success of our ELLs by  IReady, Mathletics, ELA, and NYSESLAT results, examining the percentage of students  testing proficient/commanding  each year, moving up levels is a strong indication of program success.          4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once the summative assessment data has been gathered we have ICT classes, SETTS teachers and AIS programs available to  address interventions for our ELLS.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Teachers utilize RTI within the classroom with small group instruction; focusing on individual needs of students. Teachers are  constantly assessing students and using the results to plan future lessons and groups.  Our school uses four assessment types  for tier 1 RTI, formative, screening, outcome, and test prep; they are aligned with day to day instruction. Data is collected and  data is analyzed to plan further instruction.  We have data driven tier 1 instruction in our classrooms. Screening assessments  determine our need for intervention of tier 2 and tier 3. We have implemented Reading Recovery as a tier 3 intervention plan  within our school. We have some students in small groups consisting of 1-2 students for intense instruction. Students are  provided with increasingly intensive, targeted instruction designed to match their learning needs, as demonstrated by  performance on periodically administered assessments. This problem-solving model holds particular promise for ELLs. We  provide intensive, targeted intervention to support ELLs who are not showing sufficient progress on the skills and/or  competencies measured, such as but not limited to SETTS and AIS.        6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].    A review of the NYSESLAT and NYSITELL data indicates the following:  • In grades K thru 3 we have less than 5 students at the Entering level, most of our students are at Level 4 Expanding. All ELL  students in grades K thru 8 scored lowest in the writing sub-test.  Therefore, the implementation of Teachers College Reading  and Writing Project will play a huge part in developing our ELLs writing and overall skills.     The focus for these learners is the integration of reading and writing into activities which call upon the listening and speaking  skills.     We can also see that out of 31 students, 11 students moved up a level or more on the NYSESLAT. Most of our students are at  the Expanding level. The large increase in students scoring at the Expanding level reflect the targeted instruction received  previously.     A focus on vocabulary and reading comprehension is being used to continue growth.  We have 12 students at the  Expanding level of proficiency.         7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   We have implemented Teacher College Reading and Writing in grades K-8 which will continue to enhance our students love for  reading and writing. We also have a writing showcases twice a year and an authors celebration in individual classrooms  throughout the year, inviting parents and family members to partake in their children's writing  achievements. Additionally, all       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           61         teachers have been trained, through professional development, in developing language rich classrooms, academic language,  word work, word play and work to increase vocabulary, using tier 2, tier 3 words, and academic vocabulary. The PS/MS 105  family utilizes all available resources to prepare all students to meet high quality, challenging standards of excellence.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   The ENL program is designed to support ELLs in second language development.  ENL is provided as a pull-out  program  for students in grades K thru 5, where students are grouped by grade and level of proficiency.    P.S./M.S. 105Q has a freestanding ENL program where students receive their instruction in English.  The number of  ENL instructional units are dependent upon their score on the NYSITELL or the NYSESLAT and what level they have  achieved as required by CR Part 154.2 Regulations. Stand-alone ENL is instruction to develop English language skills so  that students can succeed in core content courses. It is delivered by a certified ENL teacher. A student may not receive  stand-alone ENL in lieu of core content area instruction. Integrated ENL is instruction to build English language skills  through content area instruction. It is delivered by a dually certified teacher (ENL and a content area) or co- teaching  by a certified ENL teacher and a certified content area teacher (i.e., English language arts, math, science, or social  studies). Both methods of integrated ENL instruction include content area subject matter and English language  development using ENL strategies. All ELLs and former ELLs up to 2 years after exiting ELL status must receive a  minimum number of units of integrated ENL.  P.S./M.S. 105Q uses a pull-out model to accommodate the needs of their ELL students and to complement their  classroom instruction.  ENL is taught through an integrated curriculum that includes reading, writing, listening and  speaking.  Ongoing articulation between the ENL teacher and the classroom teachers helps to ensure that content  based ENL instruction is complimentary to what students are learning in their mainstream classrooms.  The ENL teachers use the curriculum and modifies their teaching to make the content understandable for  ELLs.   They  teach language and content cohesively.  Lessons are developed to include language targets in every  content lesson.   The students are involved in learning, focused on language acquisition techniques that will further enable them to  meet competency when they are in their classroom.  While this model is designed to meet their needs of language  acquisition, specific attention is given to writing and vocabulary development. In grades 6 thru 7 we use a push-in  model. The ENL teachers work with ELLs in collaboration with general education classroom teachers to provide  language acquisition and vocabulary support. There is a common preparation time between the 2 teachers and/or  prior collaborative lesson planning.        b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Paste response to questions here:      c.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           62      a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              In compliance with ENL related mandates, Beginners/Entering receive 360 minutes of instructions as do Low  Intermediate/Emerging ELLs from the ENL teacher. The ENL teacher provides  Intermediate/Transitioning and  Advanced/Expanding ELLs with 180 minutes of instruction weekly.  Advanced ELLs also receive 180 minutes of ELA instruction  by the classroom teacher each week. Proficient/Commanding students are manadated to receive 90 minutes of ENL  instruction. All data is driven from student performance as well as NYSITELL and NYSESLAT test scores in order to improve  instruction.   Explicit ELA instruction takes place on a regular basis as well as small group instruction in math.  When a child still  presents learning challenges that require additional assistance, P.S./M.S. 105Q offers a variety of AIS assistance including small  group instruction on both push in and pull out on grade level.        3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.       The ENL teachers use the curriculum and modifies their teaching to make the content understandable for ELLs. They teach  language and content cohesively. Lessons are developed to include language objectives in every content lesson.  At PS/MS 105  we use common core aligned materials. All lessons are aligned with the common core standards. The certified ENL teachers  utilizes a variety of instructional techniques and ENL methodologies to enhance the academic performance of English  Language Learners.  The instructional techniques employed during instruction include modeling, scaffolding, bridging,  contextualization, schema building, text representation, and metacognitive development.  Through a thematic approach to  teaching, students are taught the four modalities of language: reading, writing, speaking, and listening; using the  aforementioned instructional techniques.  During the thematic approach to instruction the five ENL approaches are  employed.  They include Cooperative Learning, The Natural Approach, The Language Experience Approach, Total Physical  Response, and the Whole Language Approach.  For students at the entering and emerging language level, instruction focuses  on Basic Interpersonal Communication Skills (BICS).  As students reach the transitiioning and expanding  levels of language the  focus shifts towards Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency (CALP). At PS/MS 105 ELL-SWDs receive appropriate education  in the least restrictive environment and all students interact in a positive way while working toward common classroom goals.  Teachers, staff, and administrators differentiate  curricular, instruction, and schedule flexibility to meet the diverse needs of  ELL-SWD within the least restrictive environment. All teachers have common preps, grade conferences, vertical and horizontal  team meetings to collaborate and plan instruction. Curriculum may be modified to accommodate and meet student’s needs  according to IEP. Teachers write and know all goals and objectives students are working to master then work to meet their  needs. Classes are heterogeneously grouped with disabled and non-disabled peers working cooperatively.  We provide  language development and support for content instructiion in the native language. This accelerates the literacy gains in both  native languages and English, validates the prior knowledge students bring and bolsters self-esteem. Native language support  includes but is not limited to bilingual dictionaries, native language classroom libraries, technology enrichments in the native  language, such as Myon, IReady, or the buddy system all of these are used and recommended in all our classes and the  ENL/ESL program.          4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?        All ELLs are ensured proper and appropriate evaluations in their native language. Whenever necessary, students are  provided assessment in their native language. All New York State test are provided in the student’s native language.            Various instructional strategies are used to best meet the needs of the ELL students.  The program model is an English only  model where students from different countries come together to learn English.  The students are from many countries,  including but not limited to Haiti, the Dominican Republic, China, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Puerto Rico, Mexico, the Ivory Coast  and Guatemala among others.  Instructional strategies are varied but always directed to best meet the needs of the ELL  students.  Various instructional strategies used include, but are not limited to, ongoing test preparation in the four modalities  of listening, speaking, reading and writing.  By targeting these modalities of listening, speaking, reading and writing the school  strives to ensure that the ELL student population will reach academic proficiency in all content areas.  In addition to P.S./M.S.  105Q’s use of test preparation materials to assist the ELL students, the school uses the modeling and total physical responses       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           63      approaches to assist them as well.  Through these approaches the students learn English through hands-on interactive  activities.  By using role play and drama (the reader’s theatre program) the ELLs can act out their feelings in a nurturing, non- threatening environment.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a. Describe your instructional plan for SIFE.  Currently there are no SIFE students in our school. However, if we were to have SIFE students they would be offered Academic  Intervention Services and RTI support services. In addition to the mandated instructional requirements, these students would  be invited to attend our ENL After-School Program and ENL summer school.  The ENL teachers will work closely with the  classroom teacher to ensure adequate progress of these students.  b. Describe your plan for ELLs in US schools less than three years (new comers).    English Language Learners in US schools less than three years are given the mandated instructional time as prescribed by CR  Part 154.2.  In addition, these students also participate in the ENL After-School Program.  c. Describe your plan for ELLs receiving services 4 to 6 years.  Ells receiving services for 4 to 6 years will continue to receive the mandated instructional time based on their NYSESLAT scores  and proficiency levels.  These students are endanger of being long-term ELLs and level 1 or 2 in school therefore, they are our  prime candidates for AIS, Instructional Intervention planning, Extended Day, and After-School.  d. Describe your plan for Long-Term ELLs (completed 6 years).  Long-term ELLs are offered a variety of academic intervention services. They are invited to attend the After-School program.  Students receive intensive reading and/or math instruction that targets their individual needs.  Differentiated instruction is  provided in small groups.  e. Describe your plan for former ELLs (in years 1 and 2 after testing commanding).  All former ELLs receive services for 2 years after reaching the proficient/commanding level.  They receive 90 minutes of ENL  a  week. They are also offered and entitled to receive the same testing accommodations as current ELLs for two years  following  the year they passed the NYSESLAT. If it is determined that any of our former ELLs require additional support services after  exiting the program it is provided. Former ELLs are offered before/after school programs, tutoring, AIS, and/or a continuation  of ENL services for a designated period of time.        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?       At PS/MS 105 the Teacher College, Code X, and ReadyGEN Program is used in grades K- 5, 6-8 and includes an ELL-SWD  intervention component, which classroom teachers and ENL teachers implement.  The curriculum provides extra ELL support  kits and instruction that promote language development. All teachers have access to SESIS. They review students IEPs and  arrange schedules and programs accordingly to meet all mandates on IEP. Whenever necessary, student is provided with a  bilingual instructor and/or paraprofessional.  The certified ENL teachers for grades K-8, utilizes a variety of instructional  techniques, strategies, and ENL methodologies to enhance the academic performance of English Language Learners.  The  instructional techniques employed during instruction include modeling, scaffolding, bridging, contextualization, schema  building, text representation, and metacognitive development.

How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?     Parent and community involvement is paramount to the success of ELL students.  Classroom teachers are encouraged to work  collaboratively with parents to ensure that they best meet the needs of ELL students.  The ENL teachers conduct meetings for  parents to educate them on the programs available to ELL students including their parent choice options to place the children  either in a bilingual or dual language program and state assessments and standards. All teachers are contracted to meet with  parents individually. Tuesday afternoons are alloted a 40 minute time frame to conference with parents regarding their  children. We have staff available for translation service in the parent/guardians preferred language. If necessary we contact  the Office of Translation and Interpretation Unit for provisions.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Schools must individually meet with the parents or guardians of English language learners at least once a year, in addition to  parent-teacher conferences, initial parent orientations, quarterly progress meetings or other scheduled meetings provided for  parents or guardians, to discuss the goals of the program, their child's language development progress, their child's English  language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas. This additional meeting should  include school staff necessary to sufficiently inform the parents or guardians about the child's language development in all  content areas in English and in the child's home language in the case of students enrolled in a bilingual education program.  Such meeting is conducted with a qualified interpreter/translator in the language or mode of communication the parent or  guardian best understands. Parent engagement is mandated and time is provided to annually meet with ELL parents.  The ENL  teacher has a compliance binder and data binder to retain all records of her outreach to parents whether face to face, email,  letters, or by phone conference. We keep parent engagement appointments sheets, parent sign in sheets, and parent  communication logs on record. During any or all of these meetings we discuss the goals of the program, their child’s language  development progress, their child’s English language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all  content areas.  Meetings are conducted with a qualified interpreter/translator, through the Translation and Interpretation  Unit, if needed. We also currently have 5 personnel available on staff for translation and interpretation.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Laurie Shapiro, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.            2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           70                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   The Bay School                                                                              School DBN: 27Q105  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Upon registration of their child, parents must complete a home language Identification survey and go through the  informal interview session. Part III of the survey is looked at closely to see which language the parents have  documented as their preferred language of communication. This indicates the language spoken at home, as well  as most comfortable by the parents. At this time, parents are also given a copy of the DOE’s Language Card.  During Tuesday, parent communication meetings we also verify parents preferred language of communication.                2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           72     2.

Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      In accordance with Chancellor's Regulation A-663, the school provides critical communication in a timely manner for  any of the languages other than English in which assistance is needed. The school has purchased translation software  to translate school documents so that all parents receive notices and calendars on the same day.           Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       Parent feedback is extremely important to us therefore we will encourage parents to fill out parent surveys to know  what they think about the quality and availability of services. Also during any and all parent meetings we allow time  for parents to voice any questions and concerns.              2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           75
