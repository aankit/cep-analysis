This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   One World Middle School at Edenwald is a small school committed to understanding ‘who’ the child is in order to  teach them. We are dedicated to creating a respectful environment where diversity is celebrated and individuals learn  and flourish by developing character, intellect, wellness and a desire for lifelong learning. At our school, we will not  only provide students with rigorous standard-based academics, we will also provide students with a place where  learning is self-directed. Children will not only have an understanding of what they are learning but also why they are   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      learning it. We enhance our learning by celebrating success, and acknowledging student and teacher  accomplishments.    All students will graduate with the ability to be a personal leader, a community activist and an Ambassador of Change.  Similar to the United Nations charter, all cultures are celebrated at One World Middle School, real issues are  discussed, and we will provide an on-going platform for dialogue. Leaders, activists and ambassadors have a common  thread in that they communicate clearly and appropriately for the audience and message. For these reasons the areas  of writing, speaking and listening will be carefully nurtured. Students will understand the importance of being  informed and well versed in taking a position. At One World we will be guided by principles similar to the United  Nations. We will seek to maintain a place of peace and security, to develop friendly relations among communities and  to cooperate in solving problems and in promoting respect for human rights.      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Our school motto is that we “Operate at 212”. From their arrival, ambassadors are told about this theory of 212  degrees, and how we at One World, apply it to our daily lives. Each ambassador can tell you that, as individuals, we  generate force and we are committed to going the extra degree in everything we do. That’s what makes us stand  apart. Students understand that they are expected to give more than the average person. This commitment has  resulted in a range of accomplishments such as:           Google Code Next for Black and Hispanic Tech Leaders (Ambassador Design Challenge competition and   acceptance)   Scholarship awards such as TEAK program and Bard acceptance       Equity and Excellence CS4All Initiative, Computer Science Education Week: HOUR OF CODE in coordination   with our weekly 7th & 8th grade Small Group Coding    Seventh Annual One World Middle School Pi 5 tournament     NYC Pi 5 tournament (winning 2nd and 3rd place)      Education Through Music Gala    Orchestra performance at Marcus Garvey Park     Student performances such as Notes in Motion, Shrek, Once Upon an Island, African American History, Dance  and Step     Women's March Washington D.C. 2017 and New York City 2018    One World College and Expedition Tour to Upstate NY 2017: SUNY Onenta / Delhi, Syracuse University,   Niagara Falls, Cooperstown     One World College Tour to Philadelphia, PA 2017: Liberty Bell, Logan Hope School for Cambodian Refugees   where ambassadors tutored students     One World Trip to Washington, D.C. 2016 / 2017 / 2018    One World College Tour to Atlanta, GA 2015 and 2018: Historical Black Colleges/Universities like Morehouse,   Spelman, Howard     One World College Tour to Boston, MA 2016 and 2018: Harvard University, Boston College, Freedom Train,   Salem Witch sites     One World Expedition Tour to Colonial Williamsburg, VA 2017 / 2018   They enter contests (writing, videos and presentations addressing social issues like autism awareness, bullying,  leukemia and cancer awareness, etc.) Some students have created videos highlighting our school. Others have  created videos and entered them in contests for Speak Truth to Power and much more. Our ambassadors have led  fundraisers, coordinated and hosted our recent International Day, and won many awards including: ABENY Award,  Kids Who Care Awards, Varsity and Junior Varsity Championship Games, and Top 3 in the Bronx Borough Spelling Bee.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      In operating at 212, we are teaching students to take part in self-directed learning. In addition, we have a 212 board,  where we acknowledge students who are caught doing things at 212!      In 2018-2019, we continue to hone our Independent and Guided Reading initiatives through the continuation of  several successful strategies and incentives as well as new pieces. This is just one of our drives to consistently  strengthen RIGOROUS INSTRUCTION.           ELA teacher visiting classrooms to ensure fidelity and support as needed    Dedicated resources and monies to purchase requested and suggested titles for class libraries      Data-based Guided Reading initiative in place all ELA classrooms    Read-alouds in all content areas   Incentive trips to Bronx/Manhattan Barnes & Noble where ambassadors purchase books they self-select   Over the last year, we have seen ambassadors demonstrate growth in Fountas & Pinnell (F&P) levels as evidenced by  running records. Increasing their reading comprehension is crucial to not only their ELA success, but in all other  academic areas as well. Our findings during the June PD Data Dive showed that ambassadors who were stronger in  ELA performed better on the Math test as well. This was true in all areas, especially true in the Ratio and Proportion  strand, as the work is reliant on the ability to read and solve complex multi-step problems.       One of the most important aspects of our school is our ambassador population. We are proud to be going into our  sixth year as a Nest school for children who are designated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This specialized  program addresses some of the specific emotional, behavioral, social and academic needs of our ASD ambassadors.  Our teachers and administrators have attended rigorous graduate level coursework at Hunter College in order to  meet the criteria to teach Nest classes. As we move forward, we have embraced many of the Nest practices as best  practices for our entire school population and they have become One World non-negotiables for each classroom.  Examples include framing directives in positive language, integrating movement breaks during ninety minute  instructional blocks (which are supported by our brain research findings) and consistently looking at the “whole child”  which has been part of the One World vision from its inception.      In addition to developing our instructional practice, we also strive to foster, maintain and strengthen our home-school  connection. During our Parent Engagement time, teachers reach out to parents and families. Meetings are set up to  support ambassador success in class. Teachers collaborate with Montefiore to ensure we meet the needs of the  “whole child.”       When we began in 2011, we wanted to make sure we put practices in place that celebrates student achievement and  encourages a safe learning environment for all students. We, at One World, believe that creating a collaborative  culture means ensuring students have VOICE (Voice, Opportunity, Integrity, Collaboration, Equity).       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      Each month, we host a One World General Assembly (like in the United Nations) in which we:     Acknowledge & Reward ambassadors with 100% attendance for the year as well as the month    Acknowledge & Reward ambassadors who made the 212 board (212 above boiling point means going above   and beyond the required to achieve the outstanding)     Acknowledge & Reward ambassadors who were student of the month (by class)    Acknowledge the class of the month (votes are tallied from all staff all month long) We have a huge trophy   that circulates through the grade     After the acknowledgements, students who have worked on projects throughout the month have an   opportunity to present (video projects, using VOICE projects, individual/group talents)   As indicated in the mission/vision of One World, real issues are discussed and we provide a platform for dialogue. As  ambassadors, our students are guided in developing their communication and leadership skills. From the beginning,  we instill the highest expectations in our ambassadors in their ability to develop as activists who will dedicate their  time and efforts to improving their world.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   In addition to our Nest ambassadors, we are also consistently working to address the meet the needs of our  ambassadors who are designated as ENL, SETSS, or other SWDs. In each case, we have teacher teams who  continuously develop their expertise in developing our ambassadors’ potential. During our data dialogues, we look at  each subgroup to ensure that all of our ambassadors are making gains. If we find this is not the case, we collaborate  on strategies to address targeted areas of need.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   We have firmly established a school culture of collaboration, high expectations, and data-driven instruction. As we  move into Years 6-8, we are shifting our laser-like focus on strengthening each of our teaching and learning practices.  We continue to be proud of our growth as a school community. In our most recent School Quality Review (December  2015), One World Middle School earned 5 (five) Well Developed ratings. This amazing accomplishment has served as  a wonderful recognition of the hard work and efforts of our staff and ambassadors as well as a tremendous  motivation to keep getting better and better. We believe this work is in direct alignment with the EFFECTIVE  LEADERSHIP element of the Framework for Great Schools.       We have already begun the work on strengthening our ICT Teams, as aligned to COLLABORATIVE TEACHERS.      Over the last three years, distributive leadership has been in place among 6 classroom teachers for various   mentor roles and/or initiatives     Coaches are serving many roles - mentoring, support, modeling instructional practices, providing immediate   feedback and communicating and maintaining expectations adhering to our instructional focus.   o  This is continued work from 2015 - 2016 Action Plan which was rolled out in several stages  o  Specific initiatives include our 2018-2019 focus on developing student ownership in learning, Every   Second Matters (ESM), Independent Reading, Small Group, 10-10-10 Guided Reading`     The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive    By June 2017, teacher teams had self-conducted intervisitations with self-identified focii, for the purpose of   building collaboration and shared responsibility for improving teacher practice based on identified trends   o  The findings have driven Coach-created PD focused on maximizing teacher collaboration and strategic   instructional choices to impact student learning   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12      A SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENT and STRONG FAMILY-COMMUNITY TIES are some of our strengths as evidenced by  our 2017-2018 NYC School School Quality Guide results where:     95% of students say that their school provides guidance for the application process for high school    84% of students say that most students try hard to get good grades    90% of students say that teachers help them catch up if they are behind    90% of students say that teachers give them specific suggestions on how they can improve their work    83% of students say that discipline is applied fairly in their school    97% of teachers say that adults at their school help students develop the skills they need to complete   challenging coursework despite obstacles.      97% of families say that the principal is strongly committed to shared decision making    97% of teachers say that principal understands how children learn    100% of teachers say that the principal sets high standards for student learning    95% of families say that school staff regularly communicate with them about how families can help their   child learn                  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 11X529   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   332   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     Currently, we have 21 ENL ambassadors. This is a small portion of our overall ambassador population, at about 6%.  However, we have noted that it is a consistently under-achieving population. As of Spring 2018, we had 50% of our  ENL population performing at a level 2 or better. Notably, 9% of our ENL population was achieving level 3 and 4, and it  was these ambassadors who we had pre-identified as on track for our Regents course.    In Spring 2018, we administered Regents exams to our 8th graders for the first time. Our ENL ambassadors made up  a significant portion of this achievement and we plan to grow these numbers in the future.      55% of our 8th grade ENL ambassadors took and passed the Algebra Regents.     11% of our 8th grade ENL ambassadors took and passed the Living Environment Regents.     11% of our 8th grade ENL ambassadors took and passed the ELA Regents.    Over the course of three years with us, our ENL ambassadors consistently make tremendous gains as evidenced by  their NYS ELA performance, NY state Regents performance and their Commanding level as per the NYSESLAT. Our  strongest ambassadors have graduated and we are continuing this work with our existing ENL ambassadors and  getting started with incoming 6th graders.    As of October 2018, 66% of our enrolled ENL ambassadors performed at a level 1 in Spring 2018. Only a third (33%) of  our ambassadors achieved L 2/3/4 on the Spring 2018 ELA exam. Our goal is to increase the number of ambassadors  who are performing at a level 2/3/4 by 10% to 43%    The majority of our ENLs speak Spanish, with Arabic being a new additional language. This is reflective of the top 3  most predominant languages in NYC's ENL student population.   In addition to our observations of our ambassadors, we know that: (as per ENL Coordinator meetings)     ELLs are disproportionately referred for special education services in contrast to their general education peers    Program models are inconsistently implemented and adhered to        Large number of Long Term ELLs (LTE) across Bronx  Long Terms ELLs (LTE) tend to drop out of high school   As of September 2016, our 60% ENL teacher has become a full-time ENL Teacher. She has been working with our ENL  ambassadors over the last 4 years so she is very familiar with their current standing and their prior history. We feel  that it is imperative that we develop and hone a dedicated program with schedule fidelity and a highly qualified   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15      teacher. Having a teacher dedicated to this program and the needs of our ambassadors will help us to ensure that ENL  ambassadors receive targeted and consistent instruction.    She has already developed a tentative schedule based on the needs of our existing ambassadors. This work includes  the number of push-in, pull-out sessions dependent upon the demonstrated level of NYSESLAT achievement:  emerging, commanding, former ENLs, etc.    Our 2015-16 Quality Review noted that 1.2 "develop teacher pedagogy from a set of coherent beliefs about how  students learn best" was recognized as our area of Celebration. To this end, we feel that we will be able to  successfully develop, implement and refine targeted instructional practices across the school to serve the needs of  our ENL ambassadors.   This work is also aligned to our 2015 Quality Review area of focus in 4.2: Engage in a structured professional  collaboration on teams using an inquiry approach that promotes shared leadership and focuses on improved student  learning. Both Goals #1 and #2 have been developed to strengthen our focus on ambassador achievement.  As  always, we are refining and strengthening this work through the 2018-2019.           Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   By June 2019, the number of ENL ambassadors achieving at a level 2/3/4 will increase 10% from 33% to 43%. Over the  years, we have been consistently able to demonstrate progress with our ENL population - consistently shrinking the  number of ambassadors performing at a level 1 and increasing the number to ambassadors achieving level 3/4. We  continue this work because we have seen amazing results over the course of three years, as evidenced by the ENL  ambassadors who qualified to take and pass the Regents exams (Algebra, Living Environment, ELA)     55% of our 8th grade ENL ambassadors took and passed the Algebra Regents.     11% of our 8th grade ENL ambassadors took and passed the Living Environment Regents.     11% of our 8th grade ENL ambassadors took and passed the ELA Regents.             2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          16     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies your school  will implement to achieve the identified goal for this Framework for Great  Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional development,      and/or systems and structures needed to impact change.

Specifically, we are  looking to see if we have maintained progress as evidenced by NYSESLAT criteria and ELA test simulations. This year's  goal is supporting all ambassadors to make progress - regardless of their starting point. As we push to decrease our  Level 1s, we are also identifying and developing action plans to support more ENL ambassadors in acheiving L 3/4.  Beyond that, we are looking to see at individual scores to determine progress and performance levels on NYSESLAT  and LAB-R.       1.

Each ENL ambassador will have a progress monitoring system where they are aware of their current F&P reading level  and their goal level for the next assessment (varied by level and by ambassador)   3. How are our ENL ambassadors performing on NYS ELA Test simulations?   We will compare their 1st benchmark simulation to their Spring 2017 score to determine growth, regression, or  stagnation. We will use the benchmark score to set a goal for the next simulation - broken down by performance on  the multiple choice questions, short answer and essay components.

What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  Our next goal is aligned to ensuring that each of our ambassadors demonstrate progress on the NYS ELA exam. We  will be aligning this larger goal to a smaller goal in order to track our progress as a school community by comparing  our ELA Test Simulation results from October to January. Our teachers have adopted the released questions from  EngageNY as a resource for our OWMS test simulation. We are looking for 30% growth which is strenuous, but  attainable as we have so much resources and initiatives aligned to strengthening reading comprehension and  progress monitoring.   We have decided to focus on this measure because:     Using one simulation provides a clear apples-to-apples comparison so we can identify and address the areas      of need.  Simulation comparisons are clear evidence of growth, stagnation or loss. Easy for ambassadors, teachers and  parents to see and understand.     Problems (stagnation/loss) can easily be addressed in February instead of waiting till end of year to get results    Each individual is at a different place but can share the same goal for growth    Ambassadors can track their own progress in between school-wide assessments through Fountas & Pinnell   progress.      Ambassadors can read beyond our recommendations to move at their own pace    An effective SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENT at One World requires a balance between support and accountability      the support of staff   o  Coaches and Instructional Cabinet  o  o  professional development to prepare, review and build action plans around data   looking at class and grade level progress reports   the support of peers for academic progress   o  growth and/or goals met will be recognized in monthly General Assemblies   allocation of resources         o  o   laptops/tech to take assessments  time built into pacing calendar      clear communication of high expectations   o   tracking individual progress and group progress monitoring through F&P running records     develop and communicate action plans to support individuals who are meeting, exceeding   and/or struggling to meet goals   o  advance notice of assessment dates for ambassadors and families (and timely reminders)   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          23      This work is aligned to our December 2015 Quality Review area of focus in 4.2: Engage in a structured professional  collaboration on teams using an inquiry approach that promotes shared leadership and focuses on improved student  learning.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   In 2017-18, we set a goal where 75% of ratings in Danielson's 1e: Designing Coherent Instruction will be rated  Effective or Highly Effective as evidenced by the June 2018 Advance dashboard. This was an anticipated growth of  6%. By June 2018, we were able to ascertain that we had surpassed this goal, reaching 86% either Effective or  Highly Effective. The overall average was a 2.87 in this competency.       In looking at other competencies, we have strong Effective/Highly Effective ratings throughout. Instead of looking  at our schoolwide data, we are now focusing on the individual teachers whose ratings in the areas of 1a (Content  and Pedagogy) and 1e (Designing Coherent Instruction) are below 3.0.       Over the past 3 years, our Professional Development has addressed improving teaching and learning by focusing on  alignment and clarity. Each unit study, across grade teams and department teams, has been reviewed through the  lens of alignment of objective, learning activity, assessment, essential question, etc.    Last year, we did a great deal of work in aligning our objectives, tasks/activities and assessments. This was laborious  and time-intensive work to deeply analyze and ask questions about whether the work was aligned in reality, not just  our planning, and how to develop best practices around this. The ELA team began to refrain from providing an  objective for each class, asking instead, for ambassadors to jot down what they thought was the objective of the  lesson. As time went on, our objectives and their interpretation of intended objectives became more in sync.    In addition to alignment, we want to ensure that assessment:          is consistent (planning and executing the lesson so we don't run of time for close/assessment)  is used to drive instruction - what and how we score, turn around time, etc  is used to provide feedback with clear next steps      As of June 2017, the ratings for 1e: Designing Coherent Instruction is is 65% Effective and 4% Highly Effective.    As of June 2018, the ratings for 1e: Designing Coherent Instruction is 85% Effective and 1% Highly Effective -  surpassing the goal of 6% growth to achieve 17% growth!      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          28      As an admin team, we have noted that an Effective/Highly Effective rating in this competency is only feasible if  everything else is in place. In the past, we have focused on goals of improving 3c: Engaging the Student as a Learner  and 1e: Designing Coherent Instruction. We will continue to build upon this foundation for our new and existing  teachers but we note that a focus on assessment is needed to ensure that data-driven instruction is happening in real- time on a daily basis.    As we go forward, we will continue to focus on ambassador learning by looking at student work, analyzing for mastery  and/or misunderstandings, and planning to meet ambassador needs with CCLS-based lesson plans.   This work is aligned to our December 2015 Quality Review area of focus in 4.2: Engage in a structured professional  collaboration on teams using an inquiry approach that promotes shared leadership and focuses on improved student  learning. As a school, we are committed to constantly strengthening our knowledge base about our ambassadors  and our best practices to continue to innovate and grow ambassador achievement.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.  In 2018-2019, our goal is to increase the number of teachers who receive an overall Highly Effective rating in 1e:  Designing Coherent Instruction from 1% to 10% as per the Advance dashboard. This continues our work in this  competency. Our prior goals were dedicated to moving teachers from Developing to Effective, which we have  successfully achieved. Now we are setting our sights on Highly Effective,.    Effective planning practices can only be achieved if other elements such as: rigorous instruction, engagement, coherent  instruction, are in place. This goal will be fostered through our work in developing student ownership in our lesson  plans, which is the focus of our IF team (teachers who are leading this work) and IF groups (weekly planning meetings  built into every teacher's schedule).       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          29     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   According to our 2017-2018 NYC School Survey, we exceeded our target and outperformed both District 11 and the  city in each of the components of the Framework for Great Schools.    - Rigorous Instruction 4.81   - Collaborative Teachers 4.58   - Supportive Environment 4.18 (exceeding target but exact number has not been configured yet)   - Effective School Leadership 4.38   - Strong Family-Community Ties 4.03   - Trust 4.38   Although our NYC Survey results have always been very positive, we put tremendous work into building our  instructional capacity, developing our ICT partnerships and content teams as collaborative and critical friends, etc. and  our growth is evident in our scores for Rigorous Instruction, Collaborative Teachers and Effective School Leadership.    We have piloted several initiatives in last 2-3 years including developing Student Ownership, which is our Instructional  Focus for this year, Brain research, learning pods, and more. Through our constant striving for innovation and  improvement, we have honed for Guided Reading 10-10-10 initiative and we can see that this work, which grew out  of professional development, reflection and collaboration, has directly improved ambassador fluency, reading level,  endurance and comprehension.    Our Math team has refined our Math Exemplar protocol which supports ambassadors in developing critical thinking  skills and perseverance in problem solving.    Our Science team works as critical friends in their weekly Lesson Plan Study where they collaboratively develop each  aspect of a single lesson plan and then intervisit to see the lesson plan taught. They then come back to reflect and  share feedback about the strengths and next steps of the teaching and learning they observed.    All of this work speaks to our belief in developing teacher capacity, honing teacher knowledge and enabling teachers  to self-direct their own learning.

Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  By June 2019, we will increase the percentage of our boys of color with special needs by 10%, from 45% to 55%, who  achieve a Level 2/3/4 as evidenced by a comparison from the NYS Math 2018 vs 2019 exams. In this work, we will shift  the majority of our SWD boys of color from Level 1 to Level 2/3/4.    This focus on improving achievement for boys of color is in alignment with our district-wide focus on equity.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

Overall, we have an amazing attendance record. Our school-wide average is 94.3% (as per ATS 10/15/18)  outperforming both New York City (90%) and District 11 (91%). We put a tremendous amount of planning and  effort into ensuring that our ambassadors come to school every day and on time. This work starts with June  planning when we build in theme and incentive days, trips, dances, etc around holidays, tests, and other  attendance dips for the upcoming year. Right through the very last days of school, we have school-wide incentives  like a Staff vs. Ambassador basketball game, school field days, and other end-of-year activities. All ambassadors  and staff members who achieve 100% attendance throughout the year earn a free trip to Holiday Hills in June.    Despite this success, we know that we have a small but chronic problem with a select group of ambassadors. For  those ambassadors who struggle, our Attendance Teacher Ms. Collymore, intervenes as a support liasion. He  outreach includes:     making phone calls home to inform them of the concern         making home visits as an intensive support for chronic absentees or Tiered Response cases   collaboratively developing Action Plans to address the concern  sending home notes, flyers, recommendations   15% of NYC students in grades 1-8 miss 10% or more school days (as per everystudentpresent.org). This reduces  students' ability to learn and succeed.    In Spring 2018, we implemented an Attendance Team, consisting of our veteran Attendance Teacher, Parent  Coordinator, and administration, to address individual ambassadors who are "chronic absentees". A Focus Group of  25 ambassadors with 20+ absences was identified and given a personalized calendar so that they can track their  own attendance and lateness data. There is a small and large incentive in place for those who achieve 100% for the  week (bag of chips, snack) and 100% for the month (movie tickets, etc). This, in combination with outreach via  phone calls and notes home, has proven to be an effective system in improving their attendance rates.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and  Time-bound.   At this point, we have 55+ ambassadors enrolled for 2018-2019 who have been pre-identified as "chronic absentees"  The Attendance Team Focus Group will continue its efforts to improve attendance rates among this group. Our goal is  to reduce this group of students by 50% as evidenced by our June 2019 tallies.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:   Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

As a team, we collaboratively reviewed both the NYCPT tests (ELA, math, social studies, science) and the Performance  Series assessment (ELA, math) to determine the pros and cons of each and settle on a final recommendation. As a  school, we will utilize tne NYCPT for both ELA and Math. Social Studies will be aligned with the ELA test for MOSL  purposes and Science will be aligned with Math.            4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51         funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. One World Middle School at Edenwald, in compliance with the Section 1118 of  Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent  involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the  families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision- making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School  Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of  the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   One World Middle School at Edenwald will support parents and families of Title I students by:    ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:      ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the ESSA;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;      The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  We currently utilize the following  programs to identify our ENL students' baseline line lexile levels; Fountas & Pinnel,  iReady (Reading  & Math), Qualitative Reading Inventory-5, Word Identification and Spelling Test (WIST). Students receive a  diagnostic exam in September when they arrive at One World. The iReady assessment is then used as a benchmark assessment  throughout the school year consistently tracking student’s lexile growth since the diagnostic exam was administered in the  beginning of the year. The iReady diagnostic assess the students phonological awareness, phonics, high-frequency words,  vocabulary, comprehension of literature, comprehension of informational text and lexile performance. English Language Arts  teachers also assess all ENL students at last 3 times of school year to monitor reading levels with Fountas & Pinnell running  records. If an ENL student has shown no or limited progress on either the iReady assessment or Fountas & Pinnell running  records they are assessed with the Qualitative Reading Inventory-5 and/or the Word Identification and Spelling Test (WIST) to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      assess and formulate what is causing no or limited progress.        2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   If an ENL student has shown limited or no progress on either the iReady assessment or Fountas & Pinnell running records, they  are assessed with the Qualitative Reading Inventory-5 and/or the Word Identification and Spelling Test (WIST) to assess and  formulate what is limiting progress. This is one of the structures we have put in place to address demonstrated need.  Another  structure is all levels, progress and results are shared on a Google drive document so all teachers have access to this  information to guide their instruction. All data is analyzed by the data team then discussed amongst the teachers who teach  each class/ students. All formative data is shared on a Google drive document and discussed during a common planning  meeting after the data team has analyzed the assessment, questions, responses and scores. Then the teachers discuss a plan  for each student depending on their progress, no progress, small group differentiation instruction and/ or a re-teach lesson.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The programs for ENL students are evaluated on a cyclical basis throughout the school year. Student data for all periodic  assessments are reviewed by our ENL teacher Ms. Bustos and the appropriate grade level team. In these meetings, teachers  work collaboratively to track student’s lexile levels from iReady and Fountas & Pinnell to build goals for students to meet  during the following assessment cycle. A plan is then developed to address what strategies will be put in place to support  these student’s learning within ENL and all content areas.        4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    All summative data is shared on a Google drive document and discussed during a common planning meetings after the data  team analyzes the assessments, questions, responses and scores. Then the teachers discuss a plan for each student depending  on their progress, no progress, small group differentiation instruction and/ or a re-teach lessons.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Parents are informed by the ENL Coordinator/Provider during an individualized parent meeting. All parents are given the Ell's  Brochure, view the Parent Orientation Video and fill out the program Selection form. During this parent meeting the parent is  informed of all options including the Response to Intervention within 45 days.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   While many students are performing in the advance range on the NYSESLAT (Approximately 81.72%, 18 out of 22 students of  the total ENL population), many of these students are not meeting grade level standards according to the 2016 state exams.  Four out of eight (50%) students whom tested made progress on the 2015-2016 ELA State Exam. Although only two students  performed on a level 3 (25%), four (50%) students performed on a level 2 and three (37.5%) students performed on a level 1.  On the 2015-2016 Math State Exam 6 out of 8 students made progress, 3 (37.5%) students performed at a level 1, 6 (75%)  students performed at a level 2 and 1 (12.5%) student performed at a level 4.    The ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT) allowed us to target sub groups like high risk students, SIFE and long-term ELLs for small  group differentiated instruction and other interventions.     Once the 2017 state exams and NYSELAT data become available, we will be able to provide more accurate trends on this  population for the upcoming school year. The data patterns across performance levels on the NYSESLAT show that 81.72% of  our ENL students are at the Expanding level, which means they have shown process in mastering the English language and  18.16 % are below the Expanding level. Also the performance levels of the NYSTELL show 4 out of 22 (18.16%) ENL  students have been in the United States less than 2 years and are performing at the entering proficiency level or emerging  proficiency levels.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61            7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   All assessment data is analyzed by the data team first to find common threads between all classes on the same grade, by  standard and by genre. Then the teachers analyze the data with their department to discuss the findings and formulate next  steps for the class, grade, subgroup and/or individual students. The data creates different structures of how the teacher(s) will  revise their instructions going forward with scaffolding, discussions, differentiation, re-teach lessons and etc. for ENL students.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   At One World Middle School we have a free-standing ENL program. In August of the upcoming school year, ENL  students are placed in the 01 sections (601, 701, 801) of each grade and travel as a class throughout the day (block).  The class within itself is heterogeneous. The ENL provider integrates during Social Studies or ELA and/or has Stand  Alone periods during non-ELA, Math, Science, Social Studies or Gym periods depending on the Language  Proficiency Level (90- 360 minutes).     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Paste response to questions here:      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Paste response to questions here:         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   To ensure all ENL students are fully served, in September all ENL students are identified thru the RLAT report. After  identification of incoming ENL students and existing ENL students, we identify the amount of services needed (90 -360  minutes) and then group students by the amount of mandated minutes whether integrated and/or stand alone periods. In  addition, we look at NYESELAT scores, state scores and our baseline assessments to determine the level of instruction needed  per ENL student to create an individualized plan.   One World Middle School ensures the mandated number of instructional minutes according to the students proficiency levels  by integrating into content areas like Social Studies and ELA. As well as creating Stand Alone periods by proficiency levels  and/or by grade in a small differentiated groups. Its ensured by a specific scheduled created by the ENL  Coordinator/Provider and approved by administration to ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes as well as  programming it into STARS.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Content areas are supported for ENL students by the ENL teacher integrating into Social Studies and/or ELA periods to assist in  the content area. This ensures students are receiving assistance during content areas. Common Core learning standards are  being meet by the instruction of the content area teacher and the ENL provider providing language strategies. Students use  dictionaries, thesauruses, and translators during lessons to assist in the understanding of their native language into the English  language. Some methods which are used for the ENL students are visuals, modeling, sentence stems, word banks, extended   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62      discussions, shelter English, extended time, scaffolding and assisting background knowledge. All of these methods and  strategies are aligned with the common core learning standards because they assist the students to achieve their daily task  and yearly goals. The following strategies, instructional approaches and methods below are used to deliver content in our  program to develop comprehension of the language and content while following the Common Core Standards.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   We used a trial Renaissance Learning program that we are going to implement in the upcoming school year. ELL’s are  evaluated throughout the year by observations, quarterly ELA and Math Assessments on iReady, subject unit assessments.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    SIFE - We are beginning Collaborative Strategic Reading during the next school year 2016-2017. All of the below is used if  needed and targeted assistance depending on the needs of the students. Graphic Organizers, various leveled tasks, sentence  starters, small group instruction, word banks, front loading, wait time, role playing, discussions, Wilson Reading Program, turn  and talks, pair up with a buddy, after-school ENL program, text and vocabulary given in their native language.  Newcomer – IPAD apps that translates for students into their home language, graphic organizers, on-line books, audio books,  small group instruction, one to one instruction, visuals, wait time, Just Words, Fundations, pair up with a buddy, after-school  ENL program, text and vocabulary given in their native language.    Developing  -- All of the above if needed and targeted assistance depending on the needs of the students. Graphic organizers,  various leveled tasks, sentence starters, small group instruction, word banks, front loading, wait time, role playing, discussions,  Wilson Reading Program and after-school ENL program.       Long Term – All of the above if needed and targeted assistance depending on the needs of the students. Various leveled tasks,  differentiated tasks, leveled texts, Collaborative Strategic Reading, Wilson Reading Program, after-school ENL program and on- line practice programs (MYON reading, IXL, Khan Academy).    Former ELLs (Commanding) – various leveled tasks, differentiated tasks, leveled texts, on-line practice programs (MYON  reading, IXL, Khan Academy), pair up with a buddy (SIFE or New Comer) to assist with their learning.    Differentiated instruction for all ENL students whether SIFE, Newcomers, Developing, Long term or Former ELL's up to two  years after exiting ELL status include scaffolding, graphic organizers, visuals, front loading, vocabulary, prior knowledge, small  groups, one to one, and peer partnering. The level and intensity of the differentiation are more extreme or less depending on  which proficiency level they are currently performing.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   iReady, teacher created curriculum, grade leveled novels, Myon Reading, IXL, Khan Academy, News ELA, leveled text, and use  of Academic Vocabulary Tool kit by Dr. Kate Kinsella will be utilized throughout the year within small groups, word walls and  during instructional time. All teachers read students I.E.P’s at One World Middle School and therefore teachers know the  needs of each student with an I.E.P. For example, teachers know its required for students with extended time to receive it  even during a class assessment and not only during state exams. Teachers are provided professional development and a  Google drive folder with ENL strategies, research and information throughout the school year. The ENL provider is also  given common planning periods with the ELA and Social Studies content teachers to plan, which instructional strategies they  would implement for each lesson.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Teachers read student’s I.E.P’s during professional development time and must sign off that they have read it. The time is  allotted so all teachers know and understand the individualized education plan for each student’s needs. Students are placed  in specific sections by their needs on their I.E.P’s.    The ENL Coordinator, Ms. Bustos creates and shares a Google drive document with each ENL student's academic, behavioral  and personal information, to provide background information on each student to assist with assessing, planning and getting to  know each student.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  The Balanced Literacy approach is used during the ENL and ELA instructional time in order to develop literacy and  language skills through a number of activities.  Standards based instructional materials are provided to all of our ENL students  to ensure literacy and language development. Instructional materials are provided on different reading levels. Glossaries  and dictionaries are provided in the native language as well as instructional and trade books to support lessons.    ENL teachers employ Interdisciplinary Teaching to integrate subject matter from two or more disciplines such as English and  Social Studies, often using themes.  Academic language is formally taught and continuously practiced in the instruction of all  content areas during the literacy block for the understanding of grammar, syntax, and language mechanics as well as  exemplified in research and textbooks. The teacher differentiates instruction by adjusting the academic language demands of  lesson instruction in the following ways: modifying speech rate to clearly enunciate; direct instruction of vocabulary and  grammar; repeating key words and phrases; using context clues; modeling strategies and relating instruction to students’  background knowledge and experiences as stated in ENL Standard 5.  Scaffolding support is contingent, collaborative and  interactive. ENL teachers incorporate cooperative collaborative grouping in their lessons which allows linguistic shared  leadership by the learner, as well as social skills development.  Another language empowering activity is Think/Pair/Share. In  both activities, students with less English proficiency are interacting with more proficient students. The implementation of the  Point of Entry Model (POEM)  guarantees that students are taught heterogeneously, affording different modalities of learning,  scaffolding techniques, and data driven instruction. These teaching strategies provide students with the opportunities to  complete performance tasks and demonstrate task orientated knowledge attained within and outside the classroom.       The use of technology continues to strengthen the academic rigor already present in the classroom.  Audio enhancement is  employed by teachers in classrooms.  Professional periods allow us to discuss and ensure that appropriate technology  components are incorporated in teachers’ planning and used in the classroom. Also, an Inquiry Team is in place and has been  formed to examine data and implement best practices based on research to a select group of ENL students.    Ongoing assessment is designed and implemented to collect evidence of students’ learning and/or needs.  Results drive  instruction. The first formal ENL assessment is the Periodic Assessment based on preset criteria, and is a measure of English  language proficiency. The New York City ELA and Math Simulations are administered during the school year to all students,  including ENL students, in grade 6, 7 and 8. The NYSESLAT, also a language proficiency test, determines progress, and functions  as the ultimate form of exit criteria from ENL entitlement. These three assessments are unique to our ENL students population  and are given in addition to any other grade wide standardized test.  Performance Assessments and Standards based  Assessments are implemented and required by the City and/or State. These tests, such as the New York State English Language  Arts Test and the New York State Mathematics Test, measure educational achievement and are content area specific.  In  reviewing math results, reliance on word problems and reading comprehension was evident.  Beginner ENL students generally  score lower than Intermediate ENL students, and Intermediate ENL students score lower than Advanced ENL students.  Thus  mathematics must highlight language usage and language instruction must include mathematical vocabulary.     The disparity in levels of proficiency  between listening-speaking and reading-writing are reduced as our instructional methods  are effectively implemented. This effort provides students with additional instruction opportunities to meet academic   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64      standards. Lastly, in order to develop the whole child, various interest clubs are offered to all our students on a rotating basis  during the school day. In addition, Service Learning Projects, Education through Music, Generation On, Young Historians,  College and Historical Expeditions  and After-school Sports Clubs.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?       Collaborative Strategic Reading     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We never had a bilingual program at One World Middle School.      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All programs are offered to all children. Some programs include: Integrated Algebra, Urban Advantage, basketball, debate,  orchestra, Math club, dance, tech team, Young Historians, College and Historical Expeditions to name a few. In 2015-2016  school year the ENL students created a One World Middle School Soccer Team which was held on Saturdays from 8am - 9am  before their Saturday program. ENL students are highly encouraged to join the Young Historians weekly on Thursdays as a way  to gain prior knowledge of New York Cities historical sites, exposure, increase social skills with non ENL students and etc.      In the next school year the following will be offered specifically for ELL's.  We also offer students many supports as they transition to High School as well. Students engage in a variety of different  college and career readiness activities. Students participate in advisory classes where they are paired with adult mentors that  facilitate discussion regarding the transition from middle to high schools. Students engage in lessons on organizational  structures, goal setting, academic study skills, future careers, college requirements/options and perseverance and persistence  etc. We discuss and show the ENL students, which High Schools have an ENL students program which would work for them.  For the past two years, New World High School gave a presentation to our ENL students about the program they have at their  school and how they meet the ENL students needs in order to prepare them to be accepted and attend college. This past year  New World High School provided One World Middle School ENL students a tour of their facility and discussed their  opportunities. We also have a day when former graduates volunteer to speak to One World Middle School students (including  ENL students) about the expectations and requirements of a High School student.       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Leveled books, News ELA, World Savvy classroom, My On Reading, Google Classroom, Khan Academy, IXL, IPAD apps. All  materials are used in small group, one to one and in whole class setting in content areas with all subgroups;   All materials assist students to move performance based on their individual need and proficiency level.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Home language support is delivered through IPAD apps that translate for student to their home language and back to English.  Students also are provide content glossaries, Oxford Picture Dictionary, dictionaries and thesaurus' in their native languages as  a support.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Use research based information, check in with network support attend professional development and continue to refresh on  teacher education courses.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    One World Middle School shares the school building with two other public middle schools. The other two ENL Coordinators  and myself discuss new ideas, strategies and what we currently teaching very often.    The following materials are used;  Leveled books, News ELA, World Savvy classroom, MyOn Reading, Google Classroom, Khan Academy, IXL, IPAD apps. All   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65         materials are used in small group, one to one and in whole class setting in content areas with all subgroups;   All materials assist students to move performance based on their individual need. All teachers collaborate and discuss new  and revise ideas.      16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Scaffolded summer content areas packets with scaffolded components are provided for all grades based on the upcoming  grade curriculum. A welcome assembly from the school counselor, Mrs. Akabogu and parent coordinator, Mrs. Lynch are  provided before entering One World Middle School as well as one in September to welcome incoming students. In addition a  student mentor is introduced to the new students to show them around our school community. If an ENL student is enrolled  during the school year the ENL Coordinator, Ms. Bustos and an ENL student will show the new entry ENL student around the  school grounds and explains how One World Middle School operates on a daily basis and all the events we participate in as a  school.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    The language elective is offered to the school as a whole including the ENL students is Sign language.      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Paste response to question here:   NA     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?    Ms. Bustos yje ENL Coordinator /Provider, has been actively engaged in professional development courses specifically  designed for ENL personnel throughout the school year. These professional development courses have been offered to our  school from The Division of English Language Learners & Student Support and District 11. Additionally, Caterina Di Tillio, ELL  Services administrator and Lillian Raimundi-Ortiz, ELL Services Coordinator have provided walk through at One World Middle  School and monthly ENL Liaison Meetings.                                  Ms. Bustos, ENL Professional Development  2017-2016  2016-2015  2014-2015  Workshops in content areas for staff;   Ms. Bustos our ENL teacher, has been actively engaged in professional development courses specifically designed for ELL  personnel throughout the school year. These professional development courses have been offered to our school from  District 11 and the Development on the News & Opportunities for Educators of ELL’s site. Also ENL professional developments  are provided during Professional Development Days assigned by the chancellor. All Professional Developments are aligned  with Common Core Learning Standards.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66         2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  As noted above, Ms. Bustos our ENL Coordinator and Provider, has been actively engaged in professional development courses  specifically designed for ELL personnel throughout the school year. These professional development courses have been offered  to our school from the Bronx Field Support Center and the Division of English Language Learners & Student Support. Ms.  Bustos has received support from the ELL Services Coordinator, Lillian Raimundi-Ortiz and he ELL Services Administrator,  Caterina Di Tillio both from the Bronx Field Support Center throughout the school year. In order to meet the training  requirements for all teachers, Ms. Bustos turnkeys major instructional strategies to all staff so that they can better support the  ENL population in their core subjects using language skills.    All professional development is recorded in each teacher’s monthly log of assistance. Each teacher must turn in their monthly  log of assistance to ensure they have meet their required hours.         Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Parents and families are invited to ELL workshop each Fall.  At this workshop, the components and expectations for our  freestanding ENL program are introduced and explained.  Additionally, individualized parent meetings are set up where  parents/guardians will meet with the ENL Coordinator/provider, Ms. Bustos to review their Spring NYSESLAT results and create  an action plan to support the ambassador in making gains both in their ENL program and in their content area classes. This  work is in addition to any and all mandated DOE parent-teacher conferences and orientation meetings.     2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  Our ENL parental involvement is reflective of our overall school population. The majority of our parents are involved, receptive  and eager to learn about their child’s progress. In some rare cases, there was difficulty in reaching parents. This was due to  disconnected phone numbers or inaccurate mailing addresses, not a language barrier. ENL parent involvement is strong at One  World Middle School. Parents are willing to attend meetings with teachers and assist in the needs of their child when  necessary. The Parent Coordinator, Mrs. Lynch includes ENL parents by inviting them to meetings and school invites with  letters home in their own language. All school letters are sent home in the families native language.              Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Patricia Wynne, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   One World Middle School @ Eden                                                                              School DBN: 11x529  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      As a school community, we conduct assessment needs to Language and Translation/Interpretation services using  varied methodologies. Specifically, we utilize the Home Language Survey, review necessary written  communication to parents generated through our ESL Department, the school Guidance Department and  correspondence from the Testing and Assessment Committee. Correspondence includes, but is not limited to ELL  Parent Orientation, Entitlement and Non-Entitlement Letters, Meet and Greet, Parent-Teacher Conferences and  Parent Workshops.    We conducted our oral interpretation needs assessment by compiling statistics provided by our Home Language  Survey for all new ELLs as well as conversations generated from our Parent Orientation meetings held in  September. Our Parent Coordinator prepares and distributes a survey, in addition to conversations both in person  and via telephone, with parents and guardians. Our classroom teachers communicate to ELL Department which  parents are non English speakers and need oral interpretation regarding their students. All of this data is compiled   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70      with our office data including our blue emergency contact cards, any written/verbal requests from parents or  guardians, and ATS reports.          2.

Based on the data of  our 2015-16 ambassadors, our register  comprises a total of 18 ELL ambassadors.  Of this group of 18 students, 72% have a  Spanish-speaking background, 11% Akan,  and 5.5% Teluga, Dutch and French  respectively. The parents and guardians  with an Akan, Teluga and Dutch language  background have indicated a preference  for English language communication at  this point. Of course, we ensure that  parents and guardians are reminded of  the opportunity for translation and  interpretation services during both  formal and informal home-school  interactions, including Back to School  night, parent teacher conferences, etc.   At the present time, we have many  teachers who speak Spanish. Hence,  parents are sent written  correspondences and provided oral  communication in their language. In  addition to Spanish,we currently have  teachers who speak the following  languages: Albanian and French. In  addition, our Parent Coordinator contacts  the Translation and Interpretation Unit  when necessary. The community is  informed of their rights to translation  services via posting at the entrance to  our building in eight languages advising  parents on how they can receive further  information, support and rights to  translation services, as well as the Guide  to NYC Public Schools. In addition,  parents are orally informed of their rights  to translation services when they visit the  school by the Parent Coordinator and  other staff.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71             3.

Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       In our continual effort to grow our best practices, we will survey our ELL parents and families to determine which of  our multi-faceted approaches has been the most beneficial for their needs. This will be conducted during an ELL  parent and family workshop where parents will have the opportunity to meet with varied school staff as well the ELL  instructor, Ms. Bustos, who will provide detailed information on our freestanding ESL program. As she informs parents  about the ELA and ESL instructional strategies and content she will cover with their children, they will become more  familiar with the program, its expectations and how they can support their children at home.    We will utilize this data to enhance our current ELL strategies in order to best meet the needs of our ELL ambassadors  and their families.  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74         As noted earlier in this document, our ELL workshop in the fall of 2015, will serve as an opportunity to share the  Spring 2015 NYSESLAT scores as well as our action plan for the upcoming school year.   Simultaneously, we will foster a developing relationship with our incoming 6 th grade families while strengthening the  existing relationship with our current 7 th and 8 th grade ambassador families.   One of our goals is to have our ELL parents develop a network amongst themselves where they can share some of the  solutions and best practices they have developed in supporting their child, as well as a strong foundation on which to  grow our home-school connnection.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          75
