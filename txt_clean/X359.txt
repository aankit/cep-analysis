This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      “At Concourse Village Elementary School we provide a safe and nurturing environment where all students are  cognitively stimulated by a rigorous curriculum across all content areas. Additionally, we are personally motivated by  our core values, which are: integrity, perseverance, optimism, willingness, empathy, and respect. Through our core   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      values we foster confident well-rounded leaders who will become socially conscientious responsible adults who  positively impact the world around them.”    Currently, Concourse Village Elementary School has a collaborative partnership with The NYC Ballet, NY Cares, and  New York Historical Society. The NYC Ballet comes into the school and helps students to make their writing come to life  by adding movements and music. Our scholars are able to enjoy trips to museums and special events with the support  of volunteers from NY Cares. At the New York Historical Society scholars are able to explore artifacts connected to  what they are learning in class.                2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Concourse Village Elementary School just completed its fifth year as a new school in District 7. Our school is  comprised of 345 students from 3K through grade five. We added a grade each year and in 2016-2017 reached our  capacity with fifth grade. Our school population is comprised of 34% Black, 62% Hispanic, 3% White, and 1% American  Indian students. Boys account for 55% of the students enrolled and girls account for 45%. During the 2016-2017  school year, we added one Gifted & Talented class to our 3rd Grade. This school year we have one G&T in 3rd grade,  one G&T in the 4th grade, and one in 5th grade.       A unique characteristic about our school is that we are departmentalized in grades 3-5. We also serve a large  Integrated Co-Teaching population because we have a strong belief in least restrictive environments. Additionally, we  are a Showcase School for the 4th year in a row. As a Showcase School we open our doors to our community three  times a year. We share a promising practice with our DOE community, which has allowed us to build a strong network  of ideas and feedback. Our participation in Showcase Schools has allowed us to grow professionally as well as  strengthened our community.       We have partnered with New York Cares and through our collaboration our students receive enrichment activites that  include chess, art, and lego robotics. We have a series of 6-8 cycles of support three times per year. In addition,  volunteers visit the school and engage in one-day activities that promote community and excellence.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Our student body includes 23% English language learners and 24% special education students. In the upcoming school  year we will focus on reading and writing across all content areas. Our goal is to expose our scholars to all types of  texts in all subject areas in order to support our scholars develop as readers. Our scholars benefit greatly from  support that expands their vocabulary and comprehension skills.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The Framework for Great Schools serves as our guide in terms of the decisions we make as a school. Our school  continues to make academic progress in the area of rigorous instruction. We believe there is success in this area  because we are consistently reassessing our curriculum.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10         We use the EQuIP Rubric (Educators Evaluating the Quality of Instructional Products) to evaluate our curriculum. The  EQuIP rubric is an initiative designed to identify high-quality materials aligned to the Common Core State Standards  (CCSS). The results have shown that our curriculum is fully aligned to the CCSS; although our curriculum is aligned to  CCLS we continue to revamp our tasks to create rigorous experiences within all content areas.    Additionally, our end of year task across all grades reflect the demands of the upcoming grade, which allows us to  focus on students’ strengths and next steps as per the demands of the succeeding grade.   Our key area of focus for this upcoming year will be family and community ties. We want our parents to have an open  communication with the school and the staff. It is important that they know we are here to support them and their  family.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 07X359   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   356   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.

Indicate the data trends, source and year.     ● All content areas are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards with the use of technology as an instructional  and interactive tool with a focus on increasing engagement. We utilized a variety of resources such as teacher created  modules and math tasks from Exemplars to engage students in rigorous performance tasks. We challenge all students  to think critically and articulate their learning verbally and/or in writing. For example, the curricular delineates that  students present to one another while using the appropriate thinking maps as a tool. In addition, our math curricula is  designed to incorporate small group discussions with a focus on how to solve word problems. When problem-solving  students implement the Problem Solving Procedure, which allows them to make their thinking visible.   ● All modules and lesson plans address and/or assess the Common Core Learning Standards and reflect enduring  understandings, essential questions, learning intentions and scaffolds driven by the instructional shifts. This  coherence of curricula allows students' to make connections across content areas relative to the school-wide core  values, thus granting access to cognitively engaging tasks appropriate at all grades. The refinement of the curricula  and the planning of academic tasks provide teachers with rigorous tools that assist all learners in visualizing their  learning with enhanced vocabulary as evidenced by improved student work. We ask “So what, so why, and now what”  as a way of forcing students' to reflect on their own next steps towards learning, increase class participation as well as  develop standards-based work products that demonstrate fluency and mastery.    ● We have a school-wide protocol called “TAG! You’re It!” within the curricula engages all students, inclusive of ELLs  and students with disabilities, in reflective higher-order thinking as they provide peers with meaningful feedback by  Telling, Asking, and Giving This has resulted in strong peer feedback, which has provided all students’ with voice.   ● Our curriculum has a variety of Thinking Maps embedded that support and deepen students' learning across all  content areas. Educators model using Thinking Maps as a way to show students how to make their thinking visible. As  a result, lessons and module plans provide students with opportunities to engage in rich discussions and as a result  provide more elaborate writing samples.    ● While our curriculum is rigorous we have found that as a school our next step is to enhance our reading instruction  with a focus on reading across all content areas. In order for out scholars to be successful they need to know that  reading happens in science, math, art and even physical education. A trend we have noticed is that strengthening  comprehension across all grade levels. A trend we have found throughout our Fountas and Pinnell assessment  process is that students are able to respond to most questions however they are struggling with the "beyond the  text" questions. Therefore, our goal is to improve students’ reading comprehension by going back to the text to USE  the text to respond to the "beyond the text" questions.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13     Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  Our school culture is an aspect we continue to be extremely proud of because we have created an environment that  is beautiful, welcoming, inviting and rigorous. Our environment sets the tone for our expectations and our students  are thriving emotionally in our culture as evidenced by our number of OORS incidents. Our tasks, our discourse, and  our daily expectations communicate a high level of expectations to be the best.    We begin each day with our Scholars’ Creed of Excellence, which is as follows:    “I am a Concourse Village scholar, destined for success, educated by the best teachers on earth. I promise to exhibit  perseverance, optimism, and willingness because these are core values that build character. Additionally, I promise to  show empathy and respect to my peers, educators, and community at large, as I too require the same. Reflection and  self-regulation will keep me focused and on track toward obtaining academic and personal success. Ultimately, my  achievements will leave a lasting impression on the world.”    Our “Scholars’ Creed of Integrity” serves as an affirmation of our belief in excellence. We strongly believe in the  power of affirming your greatness therefore we begin every day with affirming our excellence. In addition, educators  refer to the “Community Agreements” whenever students need a reminder of our expectations.    At our school we have developed a strong PBIS model that truly promotes positive behavior without extensive adult  intervention and/or classroom interruptions. Through our PBIS model our students are able to receive rewards for  positive decisions they make for our school community. We consistently promote the belief of a “Community of One”  because we each have the I-POWER to make a difference. Our core values drive our school: perseverance, optimism,  willingness, empathy, and respect are the engine that drives our culture. Our scholars are well versed in our  expectations and happily subscribe to our belief system.    While our current system has proven to be effective we strongly believe there is additional room for improvement.  Our goal is to ensure that all classrooms are implementing our system with fidelity because this will allow us to make  decisions based on impact furthermore it will reduce our incidents to potentially zero. As a result, we have partnered  with Brain Power to renew our system.

Our educators’ understanding of the Common Core Learning Standards and Instructional Shifts vary across all grade  levels primarily because some are new to education therefore we are constantly engaging in discussions that deepen  our understanding. However, our educators know the importance of planning their lessons with the common core  and shifts in mind. Furthermore, our curriculum was designed using the common core and instructional shifts, which  further supports our educators’ understanding.   At our school we have a data analysis protocol that teachers utilize whenever they are using data to inform their  instruction. The expectation at our school is that educators are consistently referring to the data to make decisions  about their instruction and/or materials.    All educators are held accountable for every student’s academic progress because we believe we are a “Community  of One” which means that our collaborative success is top priority. With that said, all teachers are leaders with some  being identified as the grade leader. Our structure is as follows every member of every grade is assigned to a content  specific group. For example, in kindergarten one teacher is the lead for math, another is the lead for science, another  in the lead for literacy, and another for social studies. This structure creates a well-rounded grade that is always  informed. We intentionally designed it this way to avoid a monopoly, we did not want one person in charge of the  grade’s knowledge this process creates equity.    Moreover, we have one Peer Collaborator and one Model Teacher who support instruction along with providing  cycles of support using the Danielson Framework for teachers in need. Our two Model Teachers lead our school-wide  math development with a focus on ensuring math is rigorous thoughtful and that there is growth across all grades.    Our Science Specialist leads our school-wide efforts to become a true STEAM school. Our science specialist works  closely with the science team to design assessments and performance tasks that address the demands of the  Common Core Learning Standards and Next Generation Science Standards.    Additionally, our intervention specialist works closely with our instructional assistants on intervention practices using  Leveled Literacy Intervention. Our intervention specialist conducts observations and provides feedback to  instructional assistants using the guidelines provided in the Leveled Literacy Intervention manual. Every Monday they  plan their lessons and gather materials and/or additional resources to address students’ needs.    While we have established a collaborative environment our goal is to strengthen our professional development  process to ensure we are providing differentiation with a focus on meeting each teacher’s needs to therefore achieve  highly effective ratings in domain 3.

As a 3K-5 school we are fortunate to have the access to our preschool students therefore we have developed a  transition plan, which entails-workshops, open house, and transitioning into Kindergarten plan, which will begin in  April 2019. Pre-Kindergarten students visit Kindergarten classrooms, eat in the cafeteria, and obtain exposure to our  daily systems and structures.        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Teachers participate in two needs survey per year in January and June. We use the information to support our  teachers’ needs and as a school make a uniform decision.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds.

IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Concourse Village Elementary School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of  Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent  involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the  families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision- making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School  Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of  the school community      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Concourse Village Elementary School will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● Providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● Providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● Fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress;   ● Providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      ● Sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● Providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

RationaleThere are a total of 66 ELLs at our school: 20  kindergartens,  18 first grade students, 14 second grade students and 10 third grade students, 3  fourth grade students and 1 fifth grade student. Of those students 8 are at the entering level, 6 are  at the emerging level, 14 are at the transitioning level, and 38 are at the expanding level. Our  school-wide data along with previous NYSESLAT data show that our students are reading and  writing,  close to, on, or above grade level. However, the speaking sub-test shows our students  need support.  Therefore our school has designed a Saturday Academy program for our  newcomer and developing transitioning and expanding ELLs that will focus on Questioning and  Discussion techniques that build upon our ELL’s auditory strengths to build their oral language  skills.  2. Subgroups and Grade Levels of Students to be ServedWe will invite 16 first grade ELLs, 13  second grade ELLs, and 14 third grade ELLs to participate in our Saturday Academy  program. Of the second grade ELLs 6 are Intermediate Level and 12 are Advanced Level ELLs.  Of the 12 third grade ELLs 1 is Intermediate Level and 11 are Advanced Level ELLs. The ELLs  will be divided into three groups of ten. Each group will participate in three hour-long sessions.  Each session will be lead by a certified TESOL educator, Mayra Negrón.3. Schedule and  Duration Saturday Academy will take place over ten Saturdays from Saturday, January 26, 2019  until Saturday, April 6, 2019 9:00-12:00. 4. Language of InstructionEnglish will be the language  of instruction for the Saturday Academy. Native language supports will be used when deemed  appropriate by educators.    5. Number and Types of Certified Teachers There are three TESOL certified teachers instructing  ELLs in the Saturday Academy: Mayra Negrón,  Katy Caceres and Juddelise Lizardo  6. Types of Materials Ms. Negrón modifies the Leveled Literacy Intervention Program (at no  cost to Title III) for use during the Saturday Academy. Ms. Caceres and Ms. Nuñez utilize  REWARDS (at no cost to Title III) . REWARDS supports our core curriculum and offers  flexible implementation options. REWARDS increases fluency rates, deepens comprehension of  informational and content-area texts, and increase precision in sentence writing.  All three ELL  educators also have, at no cost to Title III, Smart Boards, iPads and teacher designed materials in  their instruction of ELLs.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47         Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.     rationale  teachers to receive training          schedule and duration      name of provider   topics to be covered   Begin description here:              ESOL Book Study1. RationaleWe have 66 identified ELLs at Concourse Village Elementary  School. All classroom and specialist teachers work with ELL students. In order to offer effective,  responsive and continual support for all educators, our resident ENL Coordinator and Specialist,  Mayra Negrón, will lead a months long book study of  Making Sense: Small Group  Comprehension Strategies with English Language Learners by Julie Kendall.Ms. Negrón will  supplement the readings and discussions with information pertinent to our specific  ELL population in order to maximize that applicability and immediate relevance to our educators  and the students they have before them. This is a repeat session because we strongly believe  books need to be reread several times to truly understand. In addition, we have new staff joining  our community.    2. Teachers to Receive TrainingAll 23 members of our teaching staff will be invited to  participate in this book study. Title III will only fund Title III teachers. The rest of staff will  participate at no cost to Title III.     3. Schedule and DurationBook study meetings will be part of our new SBO cycle of PDs. We  will attend 4 sessions from 3:20-5:30 from.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  We use the following assessments to plan for our ELL students Fountas and Pinnell and teacher created assessments.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The structures we have in place to support this effort are a running record team along with our vertical and horizontal  planning teams. Our primary goal is to plan across various structures to produce the best instructional plans for all students.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The summative assessments we use to identify progress and areas of need are Fountas and Pinnell Running Record and Eureka  Math pre and post test module assessments.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52         4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    We have an Reading Intervention Team that uses Leveled Literacy Intervention (LLI)  to conduct intervention sessions for  students performing one grade level or more below the expectation.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   We rely on reading level data and writing samples across all content areas to make decisions about support students will  need.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   We use ELA, MATH, and NYSESLAT and student writing samples across content areas to make decisions about interventions  needed for our ELL population.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   We have the Instructional Leadership Team, which is designed to disseminate school-wide and grade wide data to the school  community.             Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   We have a freestanding ENL program because we have 4 licensed TESOL Educators who provide all instruction in  English. Three grades are self-contained and our ENL Coordinator will pull out or push in as per the requirements of  the ELLs language needs.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   We have three ESL Teachers in addition to our ENL Coordinator. We group our ELLs together according to grade level with  an ESL certified teacher along with English native speakers. Students who are not in the self-contain model are pulled out for  support from our ENL Coordinator.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      We use a Balanced Literacy approach to deliver instruction. We develop our own curriculum using the Common Core Learning  Standards. We develop learning intentions to address the demands of the task and we develop language intentions to ensure  students are able to comprehend the content.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   At school we are able to assess our ELLs in Spanish however we do not have materials to assess in the other language. We have  Fountas and Pinnell in Spanish.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    SIFE students and Newcomers students receive daily support from our ENL Coordinator five days a week in a pull out and push  in capacity. Our ENL Coordinator pulls them out for 50 minute session then she also goes into the classroom to provide  additional support.     Developing students are planned for into the whole school curriculum. We design questions in advance and provide adequate  wait time. In addition, we pre-select visual aids that will add/support students understanding of the content/topic. We provide  sentence starters when appropriate so that the student feels confident when managing/understanding language.     We do not have long-term ELL students however our goal with long term ELLs is more opportunities to speak and write the  English language.     Former ELLs are monitored every 8 weeks. We review their writing and annotation markings as well as the results of their  reading comprehension assessments.             6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   We develop our own curriculum. Students have leveled texts and access to iPads to support their understanding of content.  We use Eureka Math as our main resource for teaching math. Students have access vocabulary cards. We use the Frayer Model  when introducing new words. In addition, we use the workshop model to develop instruction.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  We use an ICT model to address the needs of our Students With Disabilities. We have a strong belief in providing the least  restricted environment when it is appropriate. The entire school uses the same approach for delivering instruction.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  We use Leveled Literacy Intervention for reading intervention and "Do The Math" for math intervention.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      Our students have demonstrated growth across reading and math however our goal is to improve writing. For the 2017-2018  school year we will implement Interactive Writing and Guided Writing with a focus on coherence and relavency. We want  students to construct coherent sentences that respond to specific questions.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We have not had a bilingual program since 2013-2014.      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Our ELLs are afforded equal access to all opportunities in the school building. We actually develop programs specifically for  ELLs. For example, we selected ELLs and former ELLs along with native English speakers to participate in a Coding Program with  Schools That Can. The program was an all-year program that taught students how to code to create their own video games.     In addition, our ELL students participate in Saturday School with a focus on strengthening their oral language and vocabulary  development through content.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  All students have an iPad. We have a one-to-one program, which allows all students access to the content. We use the iPad for  reflex math, mathletics, and myOn.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   We have a Spanish library that students are able to access at any time. We do not have texts in the other languages. However,  we have started the process of students recording material in their language as a way of celebrating their native language. For  example, they record their voice onto the iPad as a way to translate a word. Our goal is to build our own library since it can  often be difficult to find materials/resources in all ten languages.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    We have a Curriculum Development Team, which takes into account age, interest, language demands, gender, and culture. We  create curriculum that finds ways to interact with each in a respectful manner. We are particularly proud of our multicultural  module because it celebrates all cultures.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    We are in a co-location with a Dual Language Charter School Bronx Global Leadership Institute for Girls and with a D75 school.  We have shared resources such as family letters and books. However, the materials are all in Spanish.      16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Our Guidance Counselor and ENL Coordinator support our newly enrolled ELLs before the start of the school year by leading an  orientation session. They conduct the basics of the school with a focus on helping them feel confident on the first day of  school. They take them through a day in the life at CVES and they show them the cafeteria, gymnasium, bathroom, music  room, and art studio.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    We do not have language electives however we do have Readers Theater, Band for 5th Grade, and choir for 4th Grade.      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55         c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Our educators participate in a yearlong PD path geared toward deepening their instructional and content knowledge.  Educators receive 10 hours of PD from our ENL Coordinator on ESL strategies. In addition, they participate in PD on teaching  reading. At CVES developing strong readers is our major focus because we are required to read across all content areas so  educators receive PD on teaching reading.      2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Our school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all teachers and  50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development by providing cycles of  Professional Development, which are led by our ENL Coordinator . She keeps the records in her office via agendas and sign in  sheets. In addition, teachers are required to complete reflection forms of PD provided.           Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   At CVES we provide four meetings for families of ELLs with a focus on sharing the progress toward meeting the goals of the  program. However, we use this as an opportunity to share practices they can implement at home to support their child's  language development.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Our families participate in Publishing Parties every 6 weeks; they also participate in art making activities with their children,  and they also play sports with their child.            Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.    We want to share that our ELLs are at the forefront of all decisions because our goal is to help every child exceed the expectation.              2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56                 2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.                     In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Alexa Sorden, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Concourse Village Elementary School                                                                               School DBN: 07X359  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      During the registration process, families fill out one of two forms in order to assess the language needs of our  parent community: either the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) for students entering grades  Kindergarten through Fourth Grade or the Pre-Kindergarten Language Needs Survey for those students entering  Pre-Kindergarten. Families complete these forms while being interviewed by our TESOL certified ENL  specialist/coordinator. The ENL specialist/coordinator confirms the language preferences of our parent  community at that time. The findings of this process are recorded in ATS as the OTELE code of the student as well  as under the RAPL (Adult Preferred Language Report). Faculty and staff reference these reports to establish the  linguistic needs of our families. Additionally parent community language preferences are recorded on Student  Emergency Contact Cards.            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60     2.

At the  beginning of the school year all staff will be granted access to the Concourse Village Elementary School T & I Google  Drive, which includes explanatory memos from our LAC, training videos from the NYCDOE T & I unit, and  informational literature from Language Line on how to access their services. Teachers will also receive hard copies of  this information in the Language Access folder created by our LAC. Additionally, our LAC will provide a language access  professional development session for all staff at the beginning of the school year.           Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      Our school will fulfill Section VII of Chancellor’s Regulations A-663 regarding parental notification requirements for  translation and interpretation services by using NYCDOE official translations of documents when available (for  example, translated report cards, bilingual school signage available for download from the NYC OELL page of the NYC  DOE website, translated copies of the Bill of Parents Rights and Responsibilities also found on the NYC DOE website  for download) and in house (school staff or parent volunteers) translations of documents otherwise. If written  translations are required teachers are to inform the school administration and parent coordinator of this need no less  than a week before the document is needed in order to ensure the all written communication is available in the  parent’s/guardian’s preferred language at the time it is needed. Notification requirements that will be provided by  our school include: the posting of the Welcome Poster at the school entrance, distribution of the Parents' Bill of Rights  and Parents' Guide to Language Access to all families, and the posting of the Language ID Guide at the security desk  and main office.           Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       Mechanisms our school will use to gather feedback from parents on the quality and availability of services include  review and assessment of parent responses on the official NYC School Parent Survey. Additionally our staff will  informally ask parents (in their preferred language) for feedback on the quality and availablity of services during the  various face-to-face interactions that occur throughout the year.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63
