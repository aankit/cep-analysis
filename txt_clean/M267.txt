This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Section 4: CEP Overview         Vision Statement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      East Side Elementary School, PS 267 is a community of learners where wonderers come to learn, where observation  and imagination are celebrated and where the question “why” is welcomed and encouraged. It is academically  rigorous, with a strong foundation in math and literacy and an emphasis on science, social studies and the arts.   The three driving principles in our approach to teaching and learning are to ensure that rigor, purpose, and  engagement are the basis for all planning and instruction. To support these principles, students need to make a  connection between what they are learning and real life. They need an opportunity to delve deeply into units of study  about the world around them in authentic and meaningful ways.   Our goal is to ensure that the wonder and excitement that students bring with them not only lasts, but also deepens  as they journey through elementary school and into middle school.         2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Demographics      East Side Elementary School, PS 267 first opened its doors in the fall of 2010 and began with three kindergarten  classes. The school is currently located at 213 East 63rd Street on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and is comprised  of approximately 410 students from grades kindergarten through fifth grade. Many families at East Side Elementary,  PS 267 come from international settings which contributes to the rich diversity that makes our small school  community so special and unique.   Asian Black Hispanic White Other Female ELL Special Education   11 % 1 % 9 % 77 % 2 % 52 % 4 % 18 %         Curriculum and Professional Development Work      Ongoing professional development is embedded as part of our school culture. Teachers and students benefit from  several collaborations from consultancy groups such as Teachers College, Southern Cross, and Goldmansour and  Rutherford. Reading and Writing units of study are adapted from Teachers College Reading and Writing Project  (TCRWP) as teachers use the books authored by Lucy Calkins and research based materials to develop rigorous  lessons that are aligned to the Common Core State Standards. Our classroom libraries are stocked with rich literature,  both fiction and non-fiction, and mentor texts are meticulously selected to help our students blossom as young  readers and writers. We believe that the best test prep comes from great instruction, well prepared lessons that teach  craft, test sophistication, and build upon a shared love of learning. Two staff developers from the TCRWP visit our  school on a regular basis across the school year to work with our teaching staff. Teachers participate in lab sites, co- teach minilessons and work hands on with authentic student work to make meaningful decisions about instructional  next steps. This work supports students in meeting the demands of the Common Core while maintaining authentic  and purposeful delivery of instruction that fosters independence and curiosity.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      In Mathematics, teachers use a combination of the TERC Investigations, Georgia Math, Engage NY, Number Talks, CGI  and Context for Learning to develop lessons and assessments. They also work closely with a staff developer from  Southern Cross as they build content knowledge and improve their practice. Teachers also spend time in lab sites,  analyzing authentic student work to make curricular decisions that best suit the needs of their students. Students are  involved in daily math lessons that connect to real life experiences and draw upon students' current knowledge and  skills to develop deeper math concepts.      In addition to the core subject areas, students participate in STEM, visual arts, physical education, music, and chess as  part of their course work.       Finally, our school has partnered with Goldmansour and Rutherford, a consultancy group, that works with teachers to  reflect on current practices and trends in the classroom to support diverse learners and students with special needs. It  is our belief that one size does not fit all and that access to the curriculum is carefully considered so that students are  met at their zone of proximal development. Individualized education plans, differentiated learning tasks, and small  group instruction is part of classroom practices across all grades. As part of the citywide focus on equity and access for  all students, this continues to be on the forefront of our work as part of our expectation for high quality teaching.      Cultural Arts Partnerships      Turtle Bay Music School is a cultural organization, supported by our PTA, that collaborates with our school to enrich  our robust arts program. Students study Orff, learn songs and dances and gain an appreciation of cultures from  around the world.       Our partnership with Friends of the Upper East Side and the New York Historical Society enriches each grades' social  studies curriculum and deepens students' understanding through hands-on learning, walks around the neighborhood  and visits to the museum.      Simply Sports has teamed up with our school to make recess time a well-rounded experience for our elementary  students. Coaches work alongside school staff and students to foster collaboration, team spirit, and sportsmanship,  which students use in their daily lives. Students not only learn a new game or the rules to a sport, but develop an  appreciation of differences, trust among team mates, and are encouraged to take risks and work together in a  supportive environment.       Parents as Partners      Thanks, in part, to our active parent body, we also offer a robust after school enrichment program that provides  families with many choices of after-school activities at the school. Partnerships with organizations such as NY Chess,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      Simply Sports and Wingspan. Parents also volunteer their time as class parents and participate in our Parents as  Learning Partners classes throughout the school year which provide parents with an opportunity to visit the class  during the instructional time and actively participate in the lessons with the teachers' support.             3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Approximately 4% of students from grades K-5 have been identified as English Language Learners. Additionally,  approximately 18% of students have been identified as students with a disability and receive special education  services such as speech and language services, occupational therapy, physical therapy, counseling and/or an  integrated co-teaching class, depending on the individual student's need.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Area of Focus for the School Year 2018-2019 Overview         The members of East Side Elementary School, PS 267 are very proud of all of the hard work and amazing teaching and  learning that takes place in the classroom and beyond. As life-long learners, we are also reflecting on how we would  like to enhance our practice, programming, and overall school environment. For the 2018-2019 school year, we will  continue to build upon our repertoire of skills and strategies to further enhance the teaching of mathematics by  raising the level of deep comprehension and rich discussion among our young mathematicians. The five goals outlined  in this plan will help prepare our students to be successful in all areas of 21 century skills as citizens of the Fourth  Industrial Revolution. These goals will also support teachers in planning lessons to address the new math standards- Next Generation Learning Standards, implementing number talks, and ensure cohesion in assessment practices across  and between grade bands.                        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 02M267   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   0K,01,02,03,04,05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   398   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

As a growing school community, East Side Elementary School, PS 267 is now in its ninth year of existence. Our school  currently has a curriculum for Reading, Writing, Social Studies, and Mathematics, which is supported by staff  developers and consultants that visit the school and collaborate with educators to strengthen the work done in  classrooms. Additionally, there are full time faculty members that engage with students in the areas of STEM, visual  arts, and physical education skills. In the 2017-2018 school year, classrooms engaged in high level professional  development work in the area of mathematics with the consultancy group Southern Cross. In its initial phase, a needs  assessment of current teaching practices, curricular usage, and student understanding was ongoing to help us  formalize a plan of action to take our math planning and students' understanding of math concepts to another level.  Grade teams were introduced to the instructional practice of "Number Talks" to deepen rich student talk around  mathematical ideas. We tested it out and now we are ready to dive in!   This year, New York State revised the mathematics standards to the Next Generation Learning Standards, which will  impact the teaching and learning in the area of mathematics thus providing a need for a revision to the curriculum.    According to the NYC School Performance Dashboard, student performance in mathematics is the following:   2015: 69% of students in grades 3-5 scored a Level 3 or higher.    2016: 80% of students in grades 3-5 scored a Level 3 or higher.   2017: 77% of students in grades 3-5 scored a Level 3 or higher.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  As the pedagogues strive to deepen their instructional practices and content knowledge in the area of mathematics,  teachers will also need to consider the "whole child" approach when implementing lessons. By this we mean that not  all children learn in the same manner and not all children can show what they know in the same manner either. Some  students are more verbal than others. Some students are better at working collaboratively, while others need more  time to develop this skill. Our needs assessment demonstrates that students benefit from verbally explaining their  thinking in literacy prior to engaging in written tasks. With this in mind, we have also seen that children can get the  "right" mathematical answer, but when asked to explain how they derived at this accurate answer, many students mix  up the verbiage and/or their verbal explanation demonstrates they are memorizing a strategy without fully  internalizing the mathematical concept which is what will ultimately prepare them for 21st century skills as adults. To  this end, the school community needs support our mathematicians by deepening the level of student talk in  mathematics through the use of "number talks".       Additionally, as noted in the 2015-2016 Quality Review, as a result of strategic teaching practices, students  demonstrate higher-order thinking in work products and discussions. However, less consistent were students fully  owning their learning and pushing each other's thinking in collaborative discussions and work products.       Finally, the goals around including "number talks" as part of our instructional practice would build on the  aforementioned cognitive processes and serve as both an instructional and assessment tool for students. When we  consider the "whole child" we will no longer consider if the student got the answer right, but instead will equip them  with the skills to explain their thinking and demonstrate their intellect in a variety of ways that more closely align with  the growth mindset.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35     State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36           Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. East Side Elementary School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I,  Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   P.S 267 will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Students are assessed using the TCRWP to assess literacy skills.  This data source provides teachers with instructional next  steps in the areas of phonemic awareness, fluency, comprehension, and vocabulary development.  In addition, informal  assessments such as word work, on-demand writing tasks, teacher observations around student talk and ongoing running  records are reviewed and shared by vertical and horizontal planning teams.   At this time, our ELL students would benefit from  further vocabulary development and continued support to master phonemic awareness skills in the early grades.  This  information is shared with teachers so they can incorporate this data into their instructional unit and lesson plans.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Differentiated rubrics and assessments are created to support students in every modality.  Leveled readings are administered  as well as organizers to guide this student during the writing process. The classroom teachers and ENL teacher work in a team   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46         which meets regularly to share these assessments and discuss the progress of each ELL and to meet the needs of each  ELL.  Based on these assessments and meetings, teachers differentiate their lessons in order to support student achievement.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The LAP team evaluates the success of its program for ELLs by analyzing the data. First, we look at the NYSESLAT scores to  ascertain if students are making gains in English language proficiency.  We also look at the students' reading levels and writing  skills. This information enlightens the staff as to how well the ELLs are progressing in academic achievement.  East Side  Elementary School's Language Allocation Policy is based on the new requirements which is either a combination of standalone  ENL instruction and integrated ENL/ELA for entering and emerging or integrated ENL/ELA or another content area for the  expanding and commanding levels as per CR Part 154.  This includes coherence, academic rigor, explicit ENL instruction,  content area instruction aligned to the standards and ongoing assessment in content areas as well as English language  development.        4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    N/A     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   At East Side Elementary School, PS 267, the 3 tiers of Response to Intervention are provided by the  kindergarten, first grade  and second grade classroom teachers of ELL students and the ENL teacher. Beyond screening and identification for ENL  services to support language development, the ELL student also takes part in RTI screening to assess whether his/her literacy  skills and competencies are meeting grade level benchmarks. If an ELL student is flagged as at- risk or below-benchmark on any  particular skill or competency, the student should receive targeted instructional support to bolster development in this area.  This support should be delivered in coordination with language support services. The core of instruction, the first tier, is  provided by each classroom teacher of ELL students with differentiation to ensure English language development for the ELL  students. The second tier, the double dose of instruction, is provided by the ENL teacher during ENL class. The third tier, the  intensive intervention, is provided by the ENL teacher by pull-out or push-in sessions where the focus is on specific learning  targets. Tier 2 and Tier 3 instruction is also tailored to meet ELLs’ language needs and incorporated into research-based  intervention strategies. Progress monitoring data is used to make educational decisions about changes in goals, instruction,  and/or services; as well as whether to consider a referral for special education services      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The data patterns across proficiency levels on the NYSITELL and the NYSESLAT reveal how students are performing in terms of  being Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding or Commanding. The ELA and math test results of the returning 4th and 5th  graders are also used.  All the returning ELLs in grades 2-5, improved on the spring 2017 NYSESLAT.  All but one  scored Expanding level. The one is a 1st grader who progressed from Entering to Transitioning.  Looking at the NYSESLAT  scores, writing is the modality which  the most students did not reach Commanding/Proficient. Reading was the second one.    The new ELL's are almost all kindergartners who either achieved Entering or Emerging level on the NYSITELL. There is one new  fourth grader and he is at the Entering level. The one fifth grader is at Expanding level and all of his teachers use his state  scores from the previous year to inform their instruction. All the ELL students need additional support in all four modalities:  listening, reading, speaking and writing.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The EDAT (ELL Data Analysis Tool)  provides  a summary of the students’ achievement and progress. The EDAT is also a way to  target instructional programs to accelerate achievement among both ELLs and non-ELLs. The EDAT is shared with all  staff.  Adjustments to programs are made depending on subject area. The adjustments are made as needed by teachers  referring to  their ongoing assessments. For example if a student scored higher on the NYSESLAT than the others he is grouped  with for ENL instruction, then he would be moved to another group which is at the same level.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47           Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   The 9 kindergarteners are in each of the 4  kindergarten classes and only one is without another ELL. The 4 first  graders are paired in two different classes, the 4 second graders are in pairs in two sections and the third grade ELLs  are in the same class. The fourth grade ELL is in the same class as the 2 former ELLs. This helps with scheduling their  ENL instruction.      During the standalone ENL class, the entering and emerging kindergarten and first grade ELLs are in one class and they  are in groups by proficiency level. They are taught by a certified ENL teacher.  The ENL teacher works in the  kindergarten and first grade classrooms with ELLs every week. The entering and emerging students receive a  combination of standalone ENL and integrated ENL/ELA instruction each week.     There is one second grade ELL at the Transitioning level at PS 267 right now. She receives a combination of standalone  ENL and integrated ENL/ELA instruction each week. The other second grade ELLs are all at Expanding. The ENL teacher  co-teaches in their second grade class.    One third grade ELLs is Expanding and the other is Emerging. They are both in the class of the third grade teacher who  is a dually certified ESL and K-6 teacher. The Emerging student also receives standalone ENL instruction from the ENL  teacher.     The Expanding fifth grade ELL  receives a combination of standalone ENL and integrated ENL/ELA instruction each  week     Former ELLs receive services for 2 years after reaching the Proficient/Commanding level. They receive 90 minutes of  integrated ENL/ELA or other content area instruction each week. There are two former ELLs in fourth grade at East  Side. The ENL teacher co-teaches  reading workshop with the the 4th grade teacher.        b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Not applicable   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Not applicable       2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Classes are organized so that ELLs in the same grade are placed in the same class as much as possible. The administration uses  the results on the NYSITELL and the NYSESLAT to facilitate this process.   The ENL teacher makes sure Entering students receive 180 minutes of stand alone ENL instruction and 180 integrated ENL/ELA  minutes per week while Emerging receive 90 minutes of stand alone ENL instruction along with 180 integrated ENL/ELA  minutes and a minimum of an additional 90 minutes of ENL stand alone instruction or integrated ENL with any content area  instruction per week as per CR Part 154-2. Transitioning needs to receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA instruction   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      minutes along with 90 minutes of standalone ENL instruction or integrated ENL instruction with any content area  per week,  but there are no Transitioning students at PS 267 right now. Expanding receives 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or other  content area instruction per week.  Commanding receives 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or other content area instruction  per week. Former ELLs receive services for 2 years after reaching the proficient/commanding level.         3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   The content areas are delivered by the classroom and ENL teachers using a variety of scaffolding and vocabulary  strategies.  Materials and lessons are adapted to each ELL's language needs.  All academic content areas are taught using ESL  strategies.  The ENL class consists of Entering and Emerging level kindergartners and first graders. The main focus is ELA where these  students are learning their letters, letter sounds, CVC words and vocabulary. Science, math and social studies are delivered  through picture books and supported with realia other scaffold learning when possible. Tasks are differentiated depending on  level. TPR (Total Physical Response) is the language acquisition method often used by the ENL teacher.   For math teachers of ELLs, the NYCDOE’s Office of English Learners, in collaboration with Math Solutions and a selected group  of educators, has developed mathematics units of study to provide support for ELLs for grades 2-5. The new Common Core  Learning Standards present a challenge as well as an opportunity to our English Language Learners. In order to meet this  challenge and embrace this opportunity, mathematics teachers must engage ELLs in high-quality instruction while providing  the necessary support. These units are intended to model some of the strategies and scaffolds that should be utilized to  provide access for ELLs. Incorporating the needs of ELLs into the design and implementation of all mathematics instruction is  of paramount importance to the success of our community. These units are available on the NYCDOE website under Educator  Resources for ELLs. There are also outside resources for ELA and Math available on the site. In Science, the science teacher  uses visuals as much as possible and models. He groups the students with students who speak the same home language as  needed. If not possible, the ELL is grouped with an English dominant student. All students have science twice a week and it is  also taught and supported by the classroom and ENL teachers. The classroom and science teachers adapt their content, modify  assignments and differentiate tasks for the ELLs.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?        When Spanish speaking ELLs are first admitted into the NYC school system, they are administered the Spanish LAB. This tool  helps teachers ascertain language skills in Spanish. In the future, were East Side Elementary School, PS 267 to have a dual  language or transitional bilingual program, students would have ongoing assessments in academic content areas as well as  language development in two languages. This assessment would match the language of instruction and programmatic goals.    ELLs read books in their native language during independent reading and the teachers have copies in English. The teacher can  assess the student's comprehension by asking questions in English about the book the student is reading in the home  languages. Native language support includes the use of bilingual dictionaries. When applicable, classroom and the ENL  teachers group the students into strategic homogenous linguistic groupings and  employ a buddy system. The teacher asks the  parent how the child's HL is developing at home. The teachers also have the Home Language Arts Progressions as a reference.  In addition to hard copy and/or online glossaries, dictionaries, books and other media in the home languages represented by  ELLs, school personnel who are able to provide support to students during the school day should be utilized to provide  clarification for ELLs (in their home languages), especially to those who may be struggling with content and concepts in math,  science, social studies, and other subjects. Each of these strategies can extend to after and before school programs, as well as  to summer school.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.   Long Term   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49      e.   Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Although we do not have SIFE students at the present time, the LAP team is preparing itself for this contingency. Age  appropriate, high interest and beginner level reading materials would be ordered. If necessary, the school would hire a  translator to assess the student's level in content areas and the school would provide additional support for these students  after school. The school would apply for a grant for high needs populations to include professional development and parental  involvement.  Newcomers require more scaffolding strategies including pictorial support and realia to make the content comprehensible.  Books with accompanying CD's and computer programs are utilized to help increase fluency and afford the student the  opportunity to hear the English language read aloud. This, in turn, will familiarize the student with English cadence.   Developing have received 4- 6 years of service and benefit from modeling, repetition, ENL lessons that preview material from  content lessons in the classroom, and lessons aligned to the Common Core Standards. They also need to be exposed to  vocabulary and do a variety of activities to acquire the language.    Long-term ELLs have received more than 6 years of service and additional assessments would be administered. Different  methodologies might be necessary. For instance, if the student were having difficulty decoding, the Wilson program might be  used. Based on the Common Core Standards, the teacher would use Hiebert's "Text-Complexity Multi-Index" to match texts to  the student. This is a research-based program. The goal would be to increase the students' fluency, comprehension and critical  thinking using literary and informational texts.   At East Side Elementary, PS 267, there are grades pre-school through fifth grade so there are no long-term ELLs who have  completed 6 years.  With former ELLs in years 1 and 2 after testing commanding these students would receive testing accommodations according  to their needs and ENL services for those two years after testing commanding on the NYSESLAT. One former ELL left the school  at the end of last year. The other former ELL is in 2nd grade and his classroom teacher is dually certified in ESL and K-6.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?            East Side Elementary School, PS 267, uses a variety of programs to support ELL-SWDs.  PAF (Preventing Academic Failure)  is an early intervention program for teaching reading, spelling, and handwriting. It prevents or addresses reading failure in  learning disabled and struggling readers. The school also uses LLI (Leveled Literacy Intervention) which is designed to support  lower achieving students at their grade level in small-group instruction. LLI supports learning in both reading and writing and  helps students expand their knowledge of language and words and how they work. In math, Envision is designed to identify at  risk students early in their math education and intervene to offer them intensive, balanced, individualized instruction that will  work with any other math program being taught to students.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?          Our special education team works with the classroom teacher and the ENL teacher to ensure that all ELL-SWDs achieve  their IEP goals. Curriculum is discussed and instructional plans are determined depending on the IEP goals. Scheduling is  coordinated with the classroom teacher, ENL teacher, and the special education teachers to meet the needs of the ELL-SWDs.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  East SIde Elementary School, PS 267, has targeted intervention programs for all students including ELLs who need additional  support. At the onset of the school year, teachers determine who might benefit from extra support in reading and math.  Next,  teachers use their formative assessments aligned to the Common Core Standards to revise that list. There are also SETSS,  Reading Recovery, Envision for math, LLI (Leveled Literacy Intervention), PAF (Preventing Academic Failure) and Academic  Intervention Services (AIS) provided to students as needed. Instruction is provided in English. Social studies and science lessons  are modified for ELLs and they have access to materials at their reading level.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50        East Side Elementary, PS 267, applied for a therapy dog last June and was one of 30 schools chosen. Jackson, our therapy dog,  is still a puppy and has 5 more training sessions to go, but in the future, he will provide social benefits for students such as  promoting greater self-esteem which is often a concern especially for Entering and Emerging level of ELLs. A therapy dog can  lift moods in the classroom, often provoking laughter. The therapy dog is also there to offer friendship and a shoulder to lean  on for students.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   There are no programs/services for ELLs that will be discontinued.        11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs at East Side Elementary, PS 267.  Breakfast is offered to every student  every day from 8:00 to 8:30. The PE teacher started a new  before school fitness program in October for 4th and 5th graders  on Wednesdays and Fridays from 8:00am-8:40 am.  East Side Elementary, PS 267, offers chess on Saturdays for anyone at any  level  from 11:00 am to 2:00 p.m. After school is Simply Sports (every day), Wingspan Arts (every day) and Chess (Mondays and  Wednesdays) from 3:00pm-6:00pm.        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  The ENL teacher uses many of the materials that the classroom teachers  are using and incorporates ENL scaffolding  methodologies to improve English language proficiency and increase content knowledge. In ELA, teachers use materials  designed by Columbia University's Teachers College Readers and Writers Workshop. These are used for newcomers and  developing ELLs.  For newcomers which are at Entering  level, websites and apps focusing on letter identification and sounds  are used such as abcya.com.  The ENL teacher helps the ELLs with grammatical structures and vocabulary. The ENL teacher is  also building a collection of bilingual dictionaries/glossaries which is distributed to classrooms with ELLs and former ELLs as  needed. If an ELL student were admitted and the school did not have a dictionary and/or glossary in his/her home language,  one would be ordered. The ENL and classroom teachers use the math program titled TERC: Investigations in Number, Data and  Space for the Common Core. The social studies program is NYCDOE: Passport to Social Studies. FOSS and an engineering  curriculum from City Technology are programs used in science.  In addition, the ENL teacher uses technology enrichments in  the home language to provide support. In each classroom, Smart Boards are used which accommodate different learning  styles.  ELLs also benefit from visual learning and the audio element of the Smart Board adds listening and speaking  practice.  All of the instructional materials are used by all students. iPads are also used along with audio books on CD.  Each  classroom has a document camera which aids ELLs when a teacher is doing a Read Aloud and can show the text projected onto  the screen for the ELLs to follow along.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?     The ELL students are given opportunities in the classroom to share their culture through pictures, stories and  celebrations.  The classroom library has leveled books, non-fiction books, CDs, books on tape, big books, and songs, etc. When  applicable, teachers group the students into strategic homogeneous linguistic groupings and  employ a buddy system. In the  future, if this school were to have large groups of ELLs who share a common language, the school might organize Native  Language Arts classes because research has shown that the more reading material that students read in the native language,  the easier it is to transition to academic English proficiency. Native language support should be systemic and not limited to the  ENL classroom. In addition to hard copy or online glossaries, dictionaries, books and other media in the native languages  represented by ELLs, school personnel who are able to provide support to students during the school day should be utilized to  provide clarification for ELLs (in their native languages), especially to those who may be struggling with content and concepts  in class. Each of these strategies can extend to after and before school programs, as well as to summer school.          14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.     The required services support and resources correspond to ELLs ages and grade levels. Since the majority of the ELLs at East  Side are kindergarteners and first graders, the focus is reading and writing skills which include letter recognition and sounds,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51         identifying and writing common sight words, and reading comprehension. Many of the nonELLs are working on the same skills.  The ENL and classroom teachers use and share many of the classroom materials.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    East Side Elementary, PS 267, does not share a building.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   All newly arrived children receive extra support and help throughout the year. When the family registers their child, the parent  coordinator introduces the family  to the ENL teacher. If necessary, a parent translator helps with the registration process and  answers questions the family may have. The family is given a tour of the school and shown the classroom where the ELL will  be. The principal also assigns a buddy to the ELL  in his or her grade to help and support him/her with the transition. If possible,  the buddy shares the same HL of the ELL. If that is not possible, then the ELL and his/her parents are introduced to students  and their parents which have the same HL. This is also for any new ELL who enrolls throughout the year.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    At this time we do not have any language electives.       18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Not applicable       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Staff Development is a key component in our professional learning community.  We have a Teachers College staff developer  who comes and teaches in a lab site and facilitates workshops.  Teachers also go to Teachers College for staff development  days in both ELA and Mathematics.  ELL issues and topics are also addressed at our monthly faculty conferences, weekly grade  meetings,  staff development days and after school professional development.  Our ESL teacher attends these workshops and  other district wide professional development. At least 15%  of the required professional development hours for all teachers as  prescribed by CR Part 80 is dedicated to language acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and  integrating language and content instruction for English language learners. This is provided by the ENL teacher.    Last year the school secretary attended a training about ELL identification, policy and procedures for ELLs which included the  input of Home Language codes into ATS, and the use of particular ATS reports which find potential ELLs and former ELLs each  year.   The ENL teacher attends various conferences throughout the school year dedicated to language acquisition in alignment with  core content area instruction, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and  content instruction for ELLs. During the 2017-18 school year, the ENL teacher will attend  bi-monthly meetings led by an ELL  Services Coordinator which may cover such topics as: integrated co-teaching for ELLs, the New Language Arts progressions,  analyzing language demands and  developing language objectives, close reading, NYSESLAT and ELA task analysis – (using the  instructional organizer), factual, interpretive and evaluative questions for text-based discussion , academic conversations, the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52         ELL Data Analysis Tool  (EDAT), reciprocal teaching, and Q-TEL Strategies for Writing –Authority List.   Election Day and a day in  early June are Chancellor's Conference Days which are days devoted to staff development. These are days when the ENL  teacher has an opportunity to attend an ELL workshop or take what she has learned at these workshops which is relevant to all  teachers and turnkey the information to the teachers, guidance counselor, secretary and parent coordinator at  East Side  Elementary School, PS 267.              2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.   As per CR Part 154.2, all teachers in the school including non-ELL teachers are provided with 15% of a total of 175 hours of  professional development in teaching ELLs over a period of 5 years. The administration has opted to use a coaching model to  deliver this support. Using this model, the ENL teacher goes into the subject area classrooms. She observes lessons, models ESL  strategies and articulates with the teachers. She assists classroom teachers in using ELL data as a tool to differentiate  instruction and explains how scaffolding strategies including text re-presentation, use of realia, schema building,  metacognition and modeling can impact academic performance.  She explains and/or demonstrates how Depth of Knowledge  levels can be made more comprehensible to ELLs.    The ENL teacher attends as many relevant workshops offered by the Department of English Language Learners and Student  Support as possible to meet the 50% of total hours be ELL-specific professional development. On Election Day, the ENL teacher  will present a workshop on the NYSELAT, looking at how the ELLs at East Side Elementary/PS 267 performed and how the  classroom teachers and other staff can help prepare them for the next NYSESLAT. On the Chancellor's Conference Day in June,  the ENL teacher will give another ELL related workshop based on the needs of the ELLs and the staff.  The ENL teacher also  ensures that she attends as many workshop as possible offered by the Department of English Language Learners and Student  Support. Copies of agendas and attendance are saved in the ENL office.    We have one ELL fifth grader at this present time and the guidance counselor is trained in using strategies to  alleviate ELLs anxiety about the transition which she applies when meeting with the 5th grade ELL throughout the school year  to discuss what to expect in middle school and helping this ELL find middle schools that are good matches for him.                               Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   An annual individual meeting with parents of ELLs is scheduled by the ENL teacher to discuss the goals of the program, their  child’s language development progress, their child’s English language proficiency assessment results, and language  development needs in all core content areas. The ENL teacher calls the parent/guardian and uses an interpreter if needed. The  ENL teacher leads the meeting.This additional meeting should include school staff necessary to sufficiently inform the parents  or guardians about the child’s language development in all content areas in English and in the child’s home language in the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53            case of students enrolled in a bilingual education program. Such meeting is conducted with a qualified interpreter/translator in  the language or mode of communication the parent or guardian best understands.  If the parent/guardian cannot attend in  person, the meeting is held over the phone. Records are kept in the ENL teacher's classroom.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Parent Involvement is very important to our school community. At the beginning of the school year, East Side Elementary, PS  267, hosted a Curriculum Night on September 26th where parents met their children's teachers and were informed of  curricular expectations. Among other ways the school tries to involve all parents is by hosting potluck dinners for families and  staff which took place September 11th-13th in the gym or cafeteria. For that occasion, parents were encouraged to prepare a  dish to celebrate their cultural heritage. During the first week of October, every kindergarten class had a neighborhood walking  trip and some ELL parents were chaperones for these walks. Parents are also invited to attend student publishing celebrations,  field trips, reading in the classroom, parent workshops, monthly PTA meetings, international day and all other school events.  Parents of ELLs are included in all of these activities and when needed translators are provided. The parent coordinator  reaches out to all of the families and encourages every family's involvement in the school activities.       Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.                             2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.                     In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Medea McEvoy, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   East Side Elementary                                                                              School DBN: 02M267  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      East Side Elementary School, PS 267, ensures that parents are provided with written translation and oral  interpretation services. In June, incoming parents fill out the Language Preference Form. This form asks parents  about their oral and written translation needs. In addition, the ENL teacher checks the RAPL report on ATS in the  beginning of the school year. This report can be used to find the school’s language access demographic. This  report pulls data from the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS), student emergency contact cards, and  optional surveys conducted by the school. When new students are enrolled, the school determines the primary  language of the parent and whether the parent requires language assistance. This is ascertained at the time of  registration. Additional ways East Side Elementary School, PS 267, collects data are: the ATS Report of Preferred   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      Languages, and a Teacher Survey (to collect data by class). A report is updated regularly with the languages that  parents speak, by class and grade.           2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.

In  addition, the school can hire  interpreters through DOE approved  vendors. At the present time, the  proficient bilingual staff includes one  Chinese speaker, one Russian speaking  staff member, one French speaking  staff member and one Spanish  speaking staff member who are called  upon to assist. In addition, we have a  Russian speaking parent and a  Japanese speaking parent that aid the  Parent Coordinator and other staff  during events and meetings.

Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      On one of the staff development days before the first day of school, the Language Access Coordinator (LAC) will  remind the staff of the goal of the school to provide limited-English proficient parents with a meaningful opportunity  to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education. The LAC will discuss the  T&I Unit’s free translation services for parent-facing documents in the 9 official languages (Arabic, Bengali, Chinese,  French, Haitian-Creole, Korean, Russian, Urdu, and Spanish) and the Big Word, the DOE’s primary vendor, for other  languages. For formal and informal face-to-face interactions such as parent-teacher conferences and IEP meetings,  the interpretation needs of the school may be covered by proficient bilingual staff, over-the-phone interpretation,  and/or hired in-person interpreters through DOE vendors.           Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      The Welcome Poster is placed at the entrance of the lobby of East Side Elementary, PS 267 in September. The links to  the Parents' Bill of Rights and the Parents' Guide to Language Access which are found on the NYCDOE website will be  added to the parent section of the East Side Elementary School, PS 267 website. Hard copies are kept in the parent  coordinator's desk in the main office. Hard copies will be distributed at the first PTA meeting, curriculum night and the  potluck. The Language ID Guide is displayed at the security desk and in the main office.           Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       A parent survey will be given by the LAC in the middle of the school year. The DOE T&I Unit will be contacted for  translations as needed. Using the feedback, changes will be made to improve East Side Elementary School, PS 267’s  communication with parents of home languages other than English.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60
