This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   P.S. 60 is a learning community that fosters creativity and where each student is special. All students will learn at high  levels in order to be a successful person in their community. Our goal is to work hard, believe in ourselves, and  communicate effectively in order to be prepared for college learning and beyond.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    We are a diverse school community that is committed to achieving academic excellence for all students in all  academic areas. The learning experiences at our school are high-quality, rigorous, differentiated, and standards- driven. We strive to prepare our students for college and career readiness.    P.S. 60 is located in Woodhaven, Queens and serves 1172 students in grades Pre-K – 5. Our teachers are dedicated to  our students and have formed strong partnerships with families and the community. Parents are provided with the  resources needed to support their children’s learning at home. College and Career readiness are encouraged through  daily lessons and a school wide ‘Race to Read’ competition.   The school’s overall continuous success can be attributed to many factors:    - There is a culture in the building of intrinsic respect which aids our instruction.    - School leaders design and plan engaging curricula using new technology including smart boards, computers, iPads,  Chrome Books, document cameras and internet-based educational programs:   - We have several computer programs for Grades K-5.    - Computer Science Coding    - MYON reader is a complete online library providing access to thousands of enhanced digital books, recommending  content by interest and reading level.   - Mathletics - online learning platform in which students can have fun while sharpening their math skills.   - Brain Pop creates animated, curricular content that engages students, supports educators, and bolsters  achievement.   - Some teachers also use ClassDojo, which is a classroom tool that helps teachers save time, boost classroom  engagement, and improve student behavior quickly and easily, with no excessive data entry. ClassDojo also lets  teachers communicate student progress with parents and students.    - School trips to museums and other cultural institutions are planned throughout the year.   -We also have a working partnership with Billie Jean King National Tennis Center where third and fourth grade  students learn the skills and strategies for the game of tennis.   - Our ARTS curriculum focuses on several famous artists every month. After studying the artist’s life and style, our  students produce their own rendition in the style of that artist. Throughout this process, all the elements of art are  taught.    - The art liaison introduces the blueprints for art through professional learning designed by NYC DOE Arts Department  through continuous professional development throughout the tri-state area.   All standards are intended to help bring students to high levels of performance to meet the rigors and demands of life  in the new century.    - Departmental program in grades 3, 4, & 5   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      - Intensive guidance and support services are provided for students experiencing difficulties that impact upon their  ability to achieve academically.    - The school has developed a Title III morning program for ELL students before school for grades 3, 4, and 5 to assist  those children in need of intervention.    - Fundations is a phonics-based program used in grades K-2. Some students receive double-dosing of Fundations in a  small group setting in order to improve phonemic awareness. Some students receive SETSS at-risk.      The use of technology, which includes document cameras, interactive boards, iPads, Chrome Books, and laptops,  helps to support learning for all students, including those with disabilities and ELLs. P.S. 60 supports classroom  teachers with supplemental materials to the curriculum.    - STEM Program (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics)   - We have a continuing collaboration/partnership with St. John’s University through the RISE Program.   - We’ve been in the School Spotlight section of the Queens Chronicle several times, such as for our school’s role in  recycling and sustainability.   - We have received a $100,000 grant from City Council Reso-A grant for technology.   - Promethean/Smartboards, document cameras, and laptop computers are in every classroom. Teachers are supplied  with iPads.   - Incorporating the Arts to the Department of Education blueprint. It is our goal to introduce students to the Arts  throughout the school building.    - We strive to build student character and plan to integrate the "Sanford Harmony" Social and Emotional learning  curriculum in the 2018-2019 school year. The mission of “Sanford Harmony" is to support an evidence-based values  education program that will impart on our children a deep concern for the well-being of others; including their fellow  students, teachers, family, and members of their local and broader communities. This is accomplished through  teaching and reinforcing daily deep feelings of commitment to values that the students internalize as ethical guides as  they mature into young adults and beyond.

High Expectations – Establish a culture for learning that communicates to staff, students, and families, and provide  supports to achieve those expectations.   Assessment – Align assessments to curricula, use on-going assessment and grading practices, and analyze information  on student learning outcomes to adjust instructional decisions at the team and classroom levels. This was our “area of  celebration.”      - Our focus for the 2018-2019 school year is in the area of: Teacher teams and leadership development – Engage in  structured professional collaborations on teams using an inquiry approach that promotes shared leadership and  focuses on improved student learning. Based on the 2017-2018 data, we will focus on distributing leadership  structures so that teachers play an integral role in key decisions that affect student learning across the school and  promoting the implementation of the Common Core Learning Standards, including the instructional shifts, so that  there is school-wide instructional coherence and increased student achievement for all learners. We will also  encourage teacher teams to analyze systematic key elements of teacher work including classroom practice,  assessment data, and student work so that there is shared improvement in teacher practice and mastery of goals for  groups of students. We will continue to support teachers as they engage in inquiry-based collaborations to strengthen  teacher instructional capacity.         3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   - Our school’s population includes 17% of students with disabilities. An Integrated Collaborative Teaching (ICT) class  on each grade allows teachers to provide specific academic support for all SWD’S in that setting. ICT teachers and  Special Education Teacher Support Service (SETSS) providers work collaboratively with all other classroom teachers to  adapt and modify instruction aligned with CCLS. These students are also provided small group instruction throughout  all content areas. SETSS providers work with small groups of mandated students in order to meet their individual  needs using data-driven instruction, Fundations double dosing, Wonder Works, Go Math Re-teach, Touch Math,  Sound Reading Solutions, Mind Play and other research-based, multi-sensory intervention materials. Teachers address  the following needs in English Language Arts: language development and processing, emergent literacy skills including   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13      decoding, comprehension and higher order thinking. In addition, mathematical computation and problem solving  skills are also an area of focus.       - 19.2% of our student population is English Language Learners with similar needs. Currently, our school provides self- contained ENL classes in grades K-5. All ELL students in grades 3-5 are given push-in or pull-out services by certified  ENL teachers. Each classroom is print-rich with labeled materials, anchor charts, and student work. ELL students  engage in small group instruction with a focus on academic vocabulary through the use of visual cues, guided reading  activities and math instruction using manipulative tools. Individual students work on language development using  Sound Reading Solutions and iReady. ELL students were also granted the opportunity to participate in a Title III  enrichment program run by certified ELL and bilingual teachers.       4.

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.        According to the most recent School Survey Report, in regard to rigorous instruction, 95% of our teachers strongly  agree that reading and writing experiences that take place within our building are grounded in evidence from text,  both literary and informational. Only 95% of our teachers strongly agree that our students interact with complex  grade-level text.       In order to ensure that we maintain teacher pedagogy, we will:   - Align teaching practices to the curricula   - Enhance student work products and discussions that reflect high levels of student thinking, participation, and  ownership   - Promote teaching strategies, including questioning   - Strategically provide multiple entry points and high-quality supports and extensions into the curricula so that all  learners are engaged in appropriately challenging tasks and demonstrate higher-order thinking skills in student work  products      In order to ensure that we engage in rigorous and coherent curricula, we will continue to:   - Differentiate instruction to cognitively engage and meet the needs of all students   - Update curriculum maps and unit plans for all content areas   - Incorporate the ELA and math shifts into units of study   - Align curricula to the Common Core Learning Standards   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          16      - Promote college and career readiness by maintaining coherence across grades and subject areas   - Emphasize higher-order skills and rigorous habits in curricula and academic tasks so that all learners must  demonstrate their thinking      At P.S. 60, we understand the need to develop our students’ literacy skills in order to create on-going academic  success in all content areas. Since many of our students are new to our country, a large percentage of our English  Language Learner population is struggling to be proficient readers. We have taken a data-driven approach in order to  improve student performance using multiple measures of student learning to identify, address, and remedy student  weaknesses, while targeting areas for growth on a continuous basis. Most recent Fountas and Pinnell results show  85% of the ELL students in grades K-2 are currently reading below grade level standards, with only 15% on grade level.  In addition, in grades K-2, only 65% of our students moved three or more reading levels from September 2017  through June 2018. These findings have directed our need to establish a positive culture for learning that conveys high  expectations to staff, students, and families in the community. We presently have 5 certified ENL teachers:one push- in and four within self-contained ENL K-2 classes. Our mission is to provide support that will assist us in meeting these  expectations with a stronger focus on differentiation to not only move our students to a higher level but also provide  activities and supports to maintain them at these levels. In order to provide support to achieve high expectations  there is a need to establish a culture for learning that communicates these expectations to staff, students, and  families.    Based on quantitative data collected on a monthly basis, we have established our priority need which is to target our  English Language Learners school-wide in order to advance these students to grade proficiency. This data-driven  approach is used to improve student performance, using multiple measures to identify, address, and remedy student  weaknesses.    On a whole, the English Language Learners have not scored as well as their peers in regard to ELA. This has been  evident in the lower grades, K-2, and has carried over to the testing grades, 3-5, as well. Based on the Common Core  Learning Standards, the Instructional Shifts for ELA, and the rigorous reading levels required for the students, it is  important to implement more open-ended/higher-level/critical thinking questions. In order to meet these standards,  we will continue to focus on text complexity, academic vocabulary, and using non-fiction texts in all grade levels,  while teaching our students to be critical readers. We also feel it is necessary to set the foundation for the students in  grades K-2 and emphasize the importance of citing evidence from text, particularly through informational texts as well  as through literacy in content areas such as social studies and science. There is also a need to strengthen the reading- writing connection using both informational and literary texts.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   By June 2019, 60% of the English Language Learners in grades K-2 will demonstrate significant gains in ELA as measured  by an increase of at least three Fountas & Pinnell levels.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          17     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

Based on the analysis of student work, teachers noted that students had difficulty organizing information and  determining importance in a structured response. Grammar and sentence structure were also noted as areas in need  of improvement.    The School Survey Report states that 86% of teachers strongly agree that they are willing to take risks to make the  school better, 81% of our teacher strongly agree that they are eager to try new ideas, and 94% of our teachers  strongly feel that they are responsible for all students’ learning, 94% of all teachers state that they design  instructional programs together and 91% of teachers feel that they make a conscious effort to coordinate their  teaching with instruction at other grade levels.   We would like to increase student academic performance using multiple measures of student learning to identify,  address, and remedy student weaknesses, while targeting areas for growth on a continuous basis. These findings have  directed our priority need to increase student enthusiasm, interest, thinking, and problem solving.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.      Our School Survey Report indicates that only 58% percent of parents feel they have had the opportunity or have been  asked to volunteer time to support the school. Ninety percent of parents say they have been invited to their child's  classroom to observe instruction and 95% feel that the teachers work closely with the parents to meet the needs of  the children.      We implemented the protocol of Student-led Conferences held during parent engagement time on Tuesday  afternoons. The Student Led Conferences provide students the opportunity to take ownership over their academic  progress and allows them to celebrate their progress with their parents and teacher. The data obtained from these  conferences illustrate a priority need for this goal.    We will continue to establish a culture for learning that communicates high expectations to staff, students, and  families, and provides support to achieve those expectations. We will continue to:   - Communicate expectations connected to a path to college and career readiness and partner with families to support  students’ progress toward those expectations   - Establish a culture for learning that systematically communicates a unified set of high expectations for all students   - Provide clear, focused, and effective feedback and guidance/advisement supports to ensure that students, including  high-need subgroups, own their educational experience and are prepared for the next level   - Communicate high expectations including professionalism, instruction, communication, and other elements of the  Danielson Framework for teaching to the entire staff, and provide training, resulting in a culture of mutual  accountability for those expectations.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  - Lead teachers support, mentor, and provide assistance for all teachers vertically and horizontally to improve  pedagogy. Teachers visit classrooms through inter- and intra-visitations in order to view best practices. Celebration  walks are a central part of the professional learning community at P.S.60. In conjunction with this, teachers have  leadership roles on teams, SLT, as well as teachers who provide for the neediest students in special education and  ENL. Teachers from specific teams turn-key information from outside providers in order to improve student  outcomes.   - Retention of teachers at P.S. 60 remains high due to a community based upon support, trust, and monthly sharing of  best ideas at the breakfast learning community. Administrators support teachers to become highly qualified with  many acquiring administration degrees. These teachers are mentored by the assistant principals. Some of the  universities and colleges that teachers have attended are St. Johns, Stonybrook, and Touro.   - Principal and administrative staff will attend NYC DOE hiring fairs in order to recruit highly qualified teachers.   - Partnership with St. John’s University - RISE Program (Residency Internship for St. John's Educators): St. John's staff  and P.S. 60 staff collaborate to mentor and train senior students enrolled in the education program at St. John's  University. St. John's students enrolled in this program will student teach at P.S. 60 and receive training, professional  learning, and mentoring from our staff. They will have hands-on training and collaborate with teachers in their  anticipated licensed concentration, such as general education, special education, or ENL. Upon graduation from this  university and the RISE Program, candidates may apply to vacancies in the school, according to their licensed area.  Encouraging teachers to mentor and train others through the RISE Program gives teachers the opportunity to take a  leadership role and has been very well-received by our staff. We have noticed that when teachers are given such  leadership roles, they are more likely to remain on our staff because they appreciate being part of a team that creates  and implements a vision for our school.        2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      - Administration will provide professional development for all staff members; we will include Instructional Rounds and  CCLS workshops to ensure that all curriculum is aligned with the Common Core Learning Standards. Professional  development is based upon Educational Rounds . The problem of practice stems from the quality of questions that are  asked in the classroom. Professional development is based upon looking at best practices. Reading skills are designed  for recalling facts and details, main idea, sequencing, cause and effect, comparing and contrasting, making  predictions, using context clues, making inferences, identifying facts and opinions, author’s purpose, figurative  language, and summarizing. These twelve skills are cycled to improve questioning three times during the school year  during professional practice. Professional development teams analyze teacher questions to determine what is most  effective. This concept is from Results Now by Schumoker that isolation in teaching practice produces poor student  outcomes. By teachers sharing best practices and high quality questions, student and teacher outcomes will improve.   - Paraprofessionals, through this process of working with students and observing high quality pedagogy, will improve  their practice enough to become highly qualified teachers themselves.   - Veteran teachers are assigned as mentors for new and non-tenured teachers.   - Opportunities for new teachers to observe a highly-effective lesson.   - Data coaching done by Assistant Principals, vertical teams, and lead teachers to help teachers plan for data-driven  instruction.   - Professional development is provided by the district as well as school administration.

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      The school provides an orientation meeting for parents of preschool students entering the elementary school  program. Information packets and support are also provided for parents. Pre-K teachers meet with kindergarten  teachers in the school to share information and records.        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     The administration meets with a committee of teachers (MOSL committee) to discuss assessment options. The school  provides professional development regarding how to use results and data to improve instruction. The data specialist  works with teachers on all grades in order to ensure that teachers understand how to implement assessment results  and use matrixes to plan and implement lessons based on students’ academic needs, strengths, and areas for  enrichment. Teachers on both vertical and horizontal teams also collaborate on how to use both formative and  summative assessment results to improve instruction.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48   Column B   Section Reference(s)  5a, 5b, 5c, 5d, 5e     5e     -5a, 5b, 5c, 5d, 5e     -5a, 5b, 5c, 5d, 5e     5a, 5b, 5c, 5d, 5e        State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49           Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 60, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the No Child  Left Behind (NCLB) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the  connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed  to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of  their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and  Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       P.S. 60 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      · providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   · providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   · fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   · providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   · sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51      · providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.          In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   · actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   · engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated directly  to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   · ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   · support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    · maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   · conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    · provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g.,ESSA/State accountability  system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning  Environment Survey Report;   · host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Elementary and Secondary (ESSA) Act;   · schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning or  evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   · translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    · conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;      Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      · holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   · hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   · encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   · supporting or hosting Family Day events;   · establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   · encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   · providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their children’s  progress;   · developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   · providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.      School-Parent Compact (SPC)   P.S. 60, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act, is implementing a  School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and  the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I, agree that this  Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for improved academic  achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure that all children  achieve State Standards on assessments.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Our school uses various assessment tools to guide instructional planning for our ELLs, including  NYSITELL, Wonders Reading  Program weekly/unit assessments, Wonders English Language Development (ELD) weekly/unit assessments, Fountas and  Pinnell,  NYSESLAT (RLAT/RNMR reports), data from NYS ELA/Math exams and Rosetta Stone. We also administer benchmark  assessments in both ELA and Math in the Fall, Winter and Spring to drive instruction as well as monitor progress. The data  provides insight into each ELL learner in terms of understanding and using the four language modalities (listening, speaking,  reading, and writing) necessary to attain English proficiency. These assessments as well as daily informal assessments allow us  to identify the strengths and weaknesses of our ELL population. This in turn allows us to differentiate instruction and group  students as necessary.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62   2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Teachers attend professional learning sessions on addressing the needs of our ELLs throughout the year.  The ENL teacher  team meets weekly to discuss and track progress of each student.  During this time best practices are shared and suggestions  are made on how to best facilitate English language acquisition.  In grades K-5 students are placed in self contained ENL classes  with one general education teacher and one certified ENL teacher.  This co-teaching model allows the two teachers to work  collaboratively to plan instruction to meet all the academic needs of their students.  In this type of setting there are  opportunities for small group instruction, flexible grouping and one on one instruction which can accelerate the learning of our  ELL students.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  8.  After examining unit exams, benchmark assessments and  NYSESLAT scores, we notice progress  in ELLs’ language  acquisition.  The same benchmark assessments are administered in the Fall, Winter and Spring.  This allows us to identify areas  of weakness in order to plan instruction, track student progress and re-evaluate  areas of strengths and weakness.   The  regular classroom teacher observes growing confidence in the children who receive ELL services. We evaluate the success of  our ENL program for our ELLs based on progress shown throughout the school year via assessment tools used in the school  (e.g. Fountas and Pinnell, Wonders/Wonder Works Reading Program Weekly Assessments,  NYSESLAT, ELA).  Student progress  is pertinent in our decision making when deciding on an ELL program that is successful for our school.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once the summative data has been gathered and baseline, progress, and areas of need have been identified, an academic plan  of action is put into place by the ENL teachers in collaboration with the general and special education classroom teachers. The  data gathered is analyzed in order to formulate instructional groups based on skill, level, English language proficiency and  individual student needs. Scaffolding and academic supports and prompts are provided and removed as needed. Instruction is  also differentiated within each group such as the use of graphic organizers, sentence starters, sentence frames and visual  aids.  As students are able to complete tasks more independently scaffolds are removed and interventions are adjusted.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   All students are universally screened in order to place them within tiers.  ELL students are given instruction beyond their  mandated ELL services if they fall within Tier II or III.  Additional instruction in literacy is given in small groups utilizing  specialized programs that specifically target their needs with regards to phonological awareness, questioning skills and higher  order thinking.  We use informal assessments to determine which level of RTI (1,2,3) is necessary to address our students'  needs.        6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Upon data analysis of student performance on the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT, we have observed a pattern across proficiency  levels and grades.  Throughout assessment, students demonstrate higher proficiency in the listening and speaking  modalities.  The scores also revealed lower proficiency levels within the writing and reading modalities.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The ELA, Math, and ENL teams meet on a regular basis in order to analyze the data obtained from various benchmarks and  assessments and determine areas of strength and weakness of individual students. There is a focus on closely monitoring the  progress of our ENL subgroup, as this is one of our CEP goals.  Through the sharing of best practices and data analysis, the  team members provide feedback and collaborate with each other in order to make adjustments to our programs.  Flexible  grouping is used in order to maximize the learning of our students.              2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63       Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Self contained ENL classrooms are heterogeneously grouped in grades K-5.  Entering students receive 180 minutes in  Stand alone ENL and 180 minutes ENL/ELA.  Emerging students receive 90 minutes of stand alone ENL,180 minutes  ENL/ELA and 90 minutes of Stand alone ENL or integrated ENL content area.  Transitioning students receive 90  minutes of ENL/ELA and 90 minutes of stand alone or integrated ENL/content area.  Expanding students receive 180  minutes of ENL/ELA or other content area.  Commanding receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or content area,  or other approved services.Instruction is differentiated based on NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, Fountas and Pinnell Reading  levels, and informal assessments. For content area instruction students are grouped heterogeneously in order to  provide opportunities for approaching level students to learn from on  level and above level students.  During Stand  Alone ENL instruction students are homogeneously grouped in order to best address their areas of need.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A     c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              Entering students receive 180 minutes in Stand alone ENL and 180 minutes ENL/ELA.  Emerging students receive 90  minutes of stand alone ENL,180 minutes ENL/ELA and 90 minutes of Stand alone ENL or integrated ENL content area. Entering  and Emerging students receive stand alone instruction through Fundations and explicit ENL instruction. Transitioning students  receive 90 minutes of ENL/ELA and 90 minutes of stand alone or integrated ENL in Science, Social Studies and  Math.  Expanding students receive 180 minutes of ENL/ELA or other content area.  Commanding receive 90 minutes of  integrated ENL/ELA or content area, or other approved services.          3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      In the program model used at P.S.60, which is Freestanding ENL, all core content is delivered in English. ELL students use the  same materials their classmates use. Newcomers use computer instructional programs such as MyOn, Mathletics, GoMath,  Wonders, and Starfall. These programs have pictures, letter recognition, words, stories, etc. that supports new ELLs with  language development.  Students also have access to iPads and laptops.  We supplement with picture dictionaries and by using  various websites for translation into student's native language when necessary.  We focus on vocabulary and pictures and/or  visuals in order to make content comprehensible.   Instruction is scaffolded through the use of graphic organizers, visual aids,  sentence frames and word walls.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      Students are given math textbooks and math assessments in Spanish.  Even though instruction is in English, students who are  in the silent phase are given the opportunity to answer or give a written response in their native language in order for the  teacher to assess their understanding.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64      SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    At the start of school, students are grouped according to their NYSESLAT English Proficiency levels.  As the ENL teacher works  with the students, the teacher determines what the students strengths and weaknesses are in each area of  instruction.  Weekly and monthly assessments are also examined in order for the ENL teacher to plan lessons.  All lessons are  differentiated according to the needs of each individual student.  Newcomers are allowed ample opportunity to hear language  (silent period).   At first instruction focuses on learning letters, letter sounds and basic social English vocabulary. As students  acquire Basic Interpersonal Communication skills the focus of instruction will shift to acquiring Cognitive Academic Language  Proficiency.  If a student is a former ELL, data from grade assessments will be used to drive instruction as well as informal  assessments by the ENL teacher.         6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   ELL students use the same materials their classmates use. New comers use computer instructional programs such as MyOn,  Mathletics, GoMath, Wonders, and Starfall. These programs have pictures, letter recognition, words, stories, etc. that supports  new ELLs with language development.  Students also have access to IPads.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  It is imperative that all pedagogues  work collaboratively to enable all ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and attain English  proficiency within the least restrictive environment. All teachers who provide services to these students must familiarize  themselves with each student's IEP in order to ensure that instruction is aligned with IEP goals. The ENL, general education,  and special education teachers work very closely to plan instruction. Small stand alone groups are created to create comfort  and meet individual student needs and goals. Scheduling is flexible so that each student receives all mandated services.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.     ENL teachers are assigned to a grade and two of them divide the largest amount of ELL students, which happen to be in  Kindergarten and First grade. ENL teachers analyze the ELL students’ performance score in each modality on the spring  NYSESLAT results. This helps target the interventions necessary for the specific modality. ENL teachers will collaborate with the  classroom teacher and any other teacher who provides instruction to these students.        Students who have been held over will be provided with RTI services. Classroom, ENL and RTI teams will keep track of student  progress by analyzing the data of the Periodic Assessments, classroom tests, literacy and math portfolios as well as their  progress report.  ENL, RTI teams and the classroom teachers will confer on students’ progress using the Reading and Writing  Checklists monthly. The Reading Checklist monitors each student’s Fountas & Pinnell reading level. The Writing Checklist  monitors each student’s growth in mechanics and content. Teachers continuously differentiate instruction and keep and track  of the students’ progress.     Students’ low performance on the writing sub-test of the NYSESLAT will receive writing intervention. In turn all teachers  working with these specific ELL students focus on practicing note taking and writing a short response after listening to  selections in preparation for the state tests.     ELL students, who did not meet the performance standard in reading, will be provided with addition instruction in reading  during the school day.  ENL and classroom teachers who are working with these students will be made aware of the students’  low performance on the reading sub-test of the NYSESLAT.  Teachers will confer with the students and keep notes on the  students’ reading behaviors. This will help teachers assess student progress on a weekly basis. In turn the teachers will focus   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65      on reading and test taking strategies, which will prepare the students for state tests. Classroom teachers, ENL and teacher  teams will compare their data using the Reading Checklist monthly to monitor students’ growth.     ELL students’ academic performance in Math, Science and Social Studies will be discussed and assessed to further provide  intervention during the school day by the ENL, teacher teams and classroom teachers. ELLs' progress in math is monitored  through periodic assessments, monthly portfolio pieces, monthly quizzes, and unit assessments. In addition, Science and Social  Studies content is differentiated through appropriate reading level material.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      This year we will be implementing the Co-Teaching, Stand Alone, and the Integrated  model of instruction due to class  placement of ELL students.   This year we have also acquired the Wonders English Language Development Reading program  which is specifically geared to address the needs of ELL students.  This program allows teachers to plan for the Entering,  Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding and Commanding students.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  We have a large population of ELLs and they are afforded equal access to all school programs. In accordance with  policy, the  following programs are implemented:  morning programs, after school programs, clubs, evening activities such as Mommy and  Me, Daddy and Me, Movie Night, Game Night, etc. . Throughout the school year, parents are invited to join their students in  the classroom to work on an activity together.  Parents are also supported by providing adult ENL classes 3 nights a week.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  ELL students use the same materials their classmates use. New comers use computer instructional programs such as MyOn,  Mathletics, GoMath, Wonders, Brainpop ESL, Rosetta Stone and Starfall. These programs have pictures, letter recognition,  words, stories, etc. that supports new ELLs with language development.  Students also have access to iPads, laptops and  chrome books to use during specified times throughout the day.  Classrooms are equipped with Smartboards or Promethean  boards.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Teachers provide Glossaries, Bilingual Dictionaries, and Spanish books in the content area and in literacy for student reading;  native language support is provided as needed. This allows students to keep up with the Core Knowledge curriculum used in  our school. Parents are encouraged to read with their child in their native language as well.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Yes, required services support and resources are age and grade level appropriate for ELLs.  ALL ELLs are taught the same  content as their peers.  ELLs receive scaffolding and visual aids to guide them in the learning process.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    N/A     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   PS 60 hosts an  ELL program for its current and former ELLs, as well as to local schools within our district.   Parent Coordinator  will meet with parents to introduce and go over all available resources they could use.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66         None       18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  ENL teachers are provided with professional development through the district and through the OELL as needed.  They also  meet monthly, or as necessary, with their Assistant Principal, who supervises the ENL program.  ENL teachers meet weekly to  discuss students and methods. Teachers and Administration use data to discuss student intervention, progress, and goals.   The ENL teachers attend monthly meetings to receive professional development on various ENL related topics with the  Director of ELL Services.  The ENL teachers turnkey information to the classroom teachers and answer any questions they may  have.        2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  During grade five meetings, teachers are provided with strategies necessary to support ELLs as they transition from elementary  to middle school.  Administrative staff prepares teachers with literature informing students and parents of various middle  school programs and school choices.    The ENL teachers attend monthly meetings to receive professional development on various language acquisition in alignment  with core content area instruction, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and  content instruction for English language learners.  The school's Professional Development Plan for the year focuses on ELLs as  well as the CEP goals.  The committee teams meet twice a month and develop agendas bases on continuous and daily  assessments and evaluations.             Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Frank DeSario, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   The Woodhaven School                                                                              School DBN: 27Q060  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Using the data recorded in ATS and based on the HLIS (Home Language Identification Survey), annual school  reports, blue emergency card indicators, discussions at school leadership meetings and PTA meetings, and daily  parent teacher contact, we assess the school’s need for written translation and oral interpretation. During the  school day, we use staff to translate. In the event we find the need for a translator, we contract outside agencies  to work with us. During our school review, parents and teachers indicate a need to translate all letters and  monthly newsletters into Spanish. Interpreters as well as school personnel who are able to translate and interpret  are made available during individual parent-teacher conferences to ensure progress in instruction.            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71     2.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      Parents receive letters, voice messages and text messages in their preferred language via School Messenger and  school created documents.            Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      All staff members are given the number for the Department of Education Translation and Interpretation Unit. Posters  are displayed in the main lobby and office with the phone number and directions on how to utilize these services. We  also have staff members available to translate for face to face parent meetings.          Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information.

Translation service funds provided by the DOE will be used for in-house interpreters to translate at PTA meetings and  parent teacher conferences or to hire an outside vendor to perform the services needed. This will allow parents to  understand standardized exams, informal assessments, and to notify parent of individual student progress. All  important documents are provided in translated form. They are distributed from the main office and the parent  coordinator also maintains a file of these documents in her office. Parental notices will be sent in English and other  target languages informing parents of the availability of translation and interpretation services at the school. In  addition, a copy of such notice will be posted in a prominent location near the main office of the school.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       At the end of formal/informal meetings with parents, pedagogues and interpreters gather feedback from parents on  the quality and availability of services based on question and answer. Parents who need further  clarification/interpretation are able to schedule appointments to privately discuss the content of the meetings, if  necessary. At PTA and school leadership meetings, parents and educators discuss and gather feedback from parents  on the quality and use of such services.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          75
