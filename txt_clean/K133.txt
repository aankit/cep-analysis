This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      The William A. Butler School (PS 133) is a Pre-K through Grade 5 school located in Park Slope, Brooklyn.   The aim of PS 133 William A. Butler School is to graduate responsible, productive, and well-rounded citizens with  strong critical-thinking and academic skills. We love our students, value our teachers and other professionals, and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      work hand-in-hand with our local community to provide every child who walks through our doors with a wonderful  education in a safe and caring environment.         2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   At PS 133, we recognize that school is the most constant environment for children outside of their homes, and so we  continually strive to build bridges between the home and school to cultivate continuity for students and their families.  Our children are never just a name or a statistic. They are individuals, citizens, and members of families, including the  PS 133 family.   PS 133 special admissions policy offers Kindergarten seats to both District 13 and District 15 families.   PS 133 reserves approximately 35% of their seats for students who are identified as English Language Learners and/or  who receives free and reduced lunch.   PS 133 is a Leader In Me School. This process is evident school-wide and is used as a way to support character  education and teach students personal and academic behaviors needed for college and beyond,. We teach students  the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People in a child centered manner. e.g. Work first, then play; Being in charge of  oneself; Think win-win, and Synergizing to get the job done.   Studio In a School is one of our many partnerships . This partnership was developed in concert with parents and staff  so that all students in grades K-5 receive visual art instruction from a teaching artist. Our students’ work is evident  throughout the school and have been exhibited at Christie's by Studio in a School.   Our Dual Language Program (DLP) started 7 years ago with the premise that students learn best if they learn to read  and write in their native language first and then transfer those skills to the target language. Our DLP begins in  Kindergarten in either French/English, or Spanish/English.      One of our instructional foci for 2018-2019 continues to be around students’ mastering grade-level specific literacy  benchmarks in speaking and listening, by establishing a strong foundation in which to develop oral and written  communication skills. This will support all students’ in career and college-readiness skills.      To that end, as we continue to establish our Dual Language Program, a challenge that has presented itself is  supporting students in developing oral language in the target language and providing the scaffolds needed to  promote second language acquisition.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Based on formative data collected by the Dual Language teachers and the feedback provided by parents it was found  that many of the L2 students needed support in completing Spanish or French homework assignments. Parents also  expressed a need to receive training and resources to help support their children in the development of the second  language. A subgroup served in this program are ENL students who are studying to learn English at the entering  and/or emerging levels. These students will receive extra supports with class work, homework, and are given targeted  work to meet their specific language needs. We also serve a subgroup of English speaking students who are learning  French and Spanish as a new language.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   An area of the Framework for Great Schools in which our school has made the most progress in Strong Family and  Community Ties. At PS 133 we have established mutual respect and rapport among educators, students, parents and  administrators through on going communication.The school communicates with parents about learning expectations  through monthly newsletters, parent conferences and progress reports. Workshops are provided to families include;  Preparing Students to Meet the Common Core Learning Standards. Monthly events like Parents as Learning Partners,  allow families to engage in reading, math, social studies or science activities once a month with their child.  Additionally, parents visit classrooms regularly and participate in student’s academic and social emotional learning by  attending ceremonies and other special events. Parents are active members of our school community and this is  evident through a robust and vibrant Parent Teacher's Association.      Our key area of focus, is in the area of rigorous instruction, specifically focusing on providing multiple entry points so  that lessons fully engage all students in high levels of thinking and discussion. We will focus on challenging high  performers with more complex thinking tasks and discussions.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 13K133   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   774   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   YES   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

After reviewing our formative and summative assessments, both the New York State English Language Arts (ELA)  Exam specifically Book 2 and Book 3, our end of year Measures of Student Learning (MOSL) writing tasks, and the On  Demand Writing Tasks, it is evident that school wide we need to be cohesive by using a standard writing continuum  Writing Pathways Performance Assessment and Learning Progression by Lucy Calkins across all grades. We have  selected grades 2nd through 5th as the critical grades in which to focus. The data trends show, that the volume of  writing has increased in grades 2, and grades 5 respectively. Students have used feedback to improve their writing,  however this needs to be an inherent trait cultivated in students to consistently demonstrate this practice. Writing  samples show that teachers have cultivated the use of the 6+1 traits and teach into the traits.This is evident in  student writing. Other trends and practices observed:      A greater explanation of evidence can be achieved by using Twin Sentences using observations, noticings,   drawing conclusions, and inferring as evidenced by using transition phrases such as This means, This shows,  This explains that     Writer needs to includes various types of relevant well chosen facts, definitions and details    The writer needs to make choices about text structures (Visualization, Main Idea/Details, Compare/Contrast,   Inferencing, Cause/Effect, Making Connections) and organization of their responses by using skill based  strategies     Through the use of graphic organizers/writing tools the writer will group information clearly and consistently   into sections or paragraphs to connect to the main topic     Through the use of the graphic organizers/writing tools the writer will be able to decompose the question and      correctly choose the relevant details to support  Students consistently demonstrate growth in this practice through 2 point state rubric, 4 point state rubric,  and TC rubrics        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

Professional Development is an integral part of teacher planning. Our PD time is very productive. Professional  development takes place either as teacher teams (grade and content level including Dual Language teams, para- professionals and cluster teachers), whole school faculty meetings, or as teacher lead content teams. This year, there  has been a shift in the school-based PD.   The topics for Professional Development were derived from the following sources: teacher surveys, formal and  informal observations, parent surveys in conjunction with teacher leaders on the PD team.   As a school community we understand the need to stay current and develop global citizens in our students. To that  end, using science assessment data, informal classroom observations, science fair expo, teacher feedback and parent  interest, we have noticed that our students need to be more immersed in the area of science and technology. Our  teachers need to become more comfortable using technology in the classroom.      While science is taught thematically in all classrooms, there is a need for more direct teaching in science coupled with  engineering , mathematics and technology. Our work in this area in 2016 culminated with one lead teacher on grades  K, 1, 2 collaborating with the science cluster teacher to do one stem unit of study on pill-bugs. This was very  successful unit and our students presented at the New York Academy of Science. Our teachers felt a sense of pride  and that they knew more about STEM than they thought.   There is also a need for classroom teachers to have professional development in STEM and well as the need for an  additional STEM cluster teacher. We will move to departmentalize science instruction between lower an upper grades  with a specific teacher to focus on Early childhood grades and the STEM teacher to focus on upper elementary grades  preparing students for middle school.   In the 2018-19 school year, it is our goal to continue to make the transition to STEM by having a pioneer group of  teachers in grades K, 1 and 2 begin this investigation.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   According to our school's Quality Review, Although the school’s curricula is rigorous and coherent, the school has not  yet fully embedded multiple entry points so that lessons fully challenge students and engage all students in high levels  of thinking and discussion. Lessons do not consistently challenge all students, particularly high performers, to their full  potential, thus limiting opportunities for them to engage in higher order thinking tasks and discussions. In some cases  students are presented with the same task and receive limited feedback from the teacher. In other cases, several  students quickly completed the task with no further direction while others struggled with minimal support.    In some of the classrooms visited students had opportunities to engage in partnership discussions ,however across  classrooms, there were uneven levels of student thinking and participation.

However, our enrollment data shows that we are not attracting or maintaining 33% of our student body as  ELL's and free and reduced lunch students. According to an assessment performed by consultants Dudley and  Hamilton through parent and staff focus groups, there is concern that as PS 133 grows, we will lose our diversity, and  our families will grow apart.    ● Dudley Hamilton Associates discovery phase findings revealed that a majority of families believe PS 133 is a warm,  caring environment that values diversity and promotes different socio- economic backgrounds with our Dual  Language Program. With our growing numbers of students, we have a large potential for more diversity, inclusiveness  and family involvement.   Our efforts to communicate high expectations to all of the school’s constituents are as follows:   ● We take great pride in communicating high expectations to the entire community as evidenced by the School  Quality Snapshot.   ● There has been and continues to be a lot work around building a culture of trust so that everyone- each child and  adult feels and recognizes s/he has a gift and is a leader in their own way.    ● This is evident in several things that we do and more so in some consistent structures that we have developed  across the years. That is to say, we have worked at developing a culture of trust among students, staff and parents by  making sure we communicate in several ways the expectations of our school. This is done through our letter to  families each month from both the teachers who clearly articulate what the units of studies are for the month and to  the letter that comes from the desk of the principal each month. First Fridays take place each month and have been  routine for several years. This is an opportunity for families to come into the classrooms and engage in a content- specific, learning activity whether it is reading, math or an art activity. This is followed up with a Principal’s Coffee  Chat each month. Parents have an opportunity to engage in conversations with the principal about any celebrations  or challenges they would like to bring to the administrative team.    ● In addition, the administrative team is extremely accessible and has an open door policy for all families. The  administration works closely with the PTA to ensure that communications are translated and the same message is  delivered in everything we do.    ● We use a school-wide Book of the Month focused on a character-building theme that aligns to the social emotional  behaviors we expect to see across the school. Teachers support this effort by teaching the habits of behavior using  both the Leader In Me and the 4R’s Reading & Writing to ensure that all classrooms are sage and caring learning  communities.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          30      ● Students take great pride in being a part of our school through being able to select the enrichment cluster/clubs  they participate in as well as elect student leaders whom they wish to advocate for them in the student government.   ● We are also establishing partnerships with families to support students’ progress towards college and career  readiness; parents are truly our partners in education. In addition, we offer many opportunities such as Coding  /Computer Science as enrichment activities, Student Led Conferences, the Dual Language Program, the Leader In Me  Process to build, cultivate and nurture distributive leadership.   ● The impact of this work to date is as follows: the tone of our school community continues to be a highlight as  evidenced by our higher than average City and District scores on the Elementary School Quality Snapshot. Both  teachers and parents celebrate this as a school community where they all have a vested interest.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41        Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. 13K133, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       [Public School 133K] will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology; i.e. Reading A-Z (Vendor- Lazel, Inc)   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

Group 1 grade 1 about 10 students  Group 2  grades 2-3 about 12 students  Group 3 -4-5 grades about 20 students  The language of instruction will be English. Student’s may use native language with bilingual  teachers for extra content and academic support. The grades serviced in this program is 1-5. All  ELLs are invited to participate in this program, regardless of which official class they are  programmed into during the regular school day. The specific programming and list of students  working with which teacher will be determined in December, this program begins in  January.  Parents are still signing students up at this point, therefore specific student groupings  have not been created.    Based on formative data collected by the Dual Language teachers and the feedback provided by  parents it was found that many of the L2 students needed support in completing Spanish or  French homework assignments. Parents also expressed a need to receive training and resources  to help  support their children in the development of the second language.To help support second  language learners in our Dual Language Program and ENL program, our after-school program  will address the needs of language learners in grades 1-5. Title III funds will be allocated in per  session funds  for professional development and educational resources and materials needed to  support both the teachers and students in the implementation of this endeavor.    The after school Teachers, three teachers with either a bilingual or ELL certification,  will  support students with strategies and extension activities with scaffoding in order to make the  content accessible to all ELLs. Students will receive instruction in their second language for  reading, writing and math.    Students will receive small group instruction on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:40 to  4:10pm beginning in January 2019 and ending in May 2019 for a total of 40 sessions. The  program will be open to grades 1-5 and students will be grouped by language proficiency level  and grade. The number of groups will depend on the levels of students that attend the program.  Instructional activities will focus on creating a digital story using technology, creative writing  skills, and oral language practice. This program will focus on including scaffolding vocabulary,  Read-Alouds, class discussions, close reading high-interests texts ranging from simple to  complex language structures.  Teachers will use authentic literature and a variety of other visual  aids including technology, examples of digital story telling, realia, and hands on activities that  allow students to internalize concepts in order to enhance comprehension and language  development.  The After-school Program will provide opportunities for students to engage in literacy activities  that promote reading and writing as a fun and interactive experience.Materials/Resources: Some  of the resources used for this program will include digital cameras and computers.Language  Proficiency Intervention materials will also be used from Readers for Writers/De la Lectura a la   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   Escritura. These materials will help support academic vocabulary acquisition fluency and  comprehension for second language learners of Spanish, which are materials that are  supplemental and distinct from materials used in class . For second language learners of French  teachers will use authentic literature, digital resources from Teacher Discovery to support  vocabulary development on a variety of curriculum based topics including animals,  communities, and culture themes. Materials used for French learners are also supplemental to  what is used in the classroom.  For our ENL students will use  Megawords and Reading explorer as supplemental supports in the  program, in addition to the daily materials used in their classroom and with the ENL teacher.    A subgroup served in this program are ENL students who are studying to learn English at the  entering and/or emerging levels. These students will receive extra supports with class work,  homework, and are given targeted work to meet their specific language needs.  We also serve a subgroup of English speaking students who are learning French and Spanish as a  new language.  Records for this program will be kept in the main office with our daily attendance. Parents will  be notified of these programs through our PTA meetings, letters mailed home, during our first  Friday parent learning days, and the ENL teacher will teach out via phone calls and emails to  ensure our ELLs enroll in this program. The parents will receive this information through their  preferred language via writing and speaking.  The records will be maintained by the teachers, teachers will use the folders with attendance  sheets provided by the office.    The three teachers running this program include one ELL certified teacher and two bilingual  certified teachers.

During these sessions families of ELLs are invited to get  information about language acquisition, language supports, and learn about opportunities to  participate in school functions with their child. our first session was in October. These sessions  are conducted by Dalila Rabsatt, our dual language coach and Jessica Kruse-Cerutti, our ENL  coordinator, Ahmed Dickerson, the parent coordinator.  Families are invited to ENL sessions during parent/teacher conference nights and open school  nights. Ms. Kruse supports ELL families through email and calls and many families reach out to  her for further clarification about their students’ needs. The two-way communication is often and  reliable between families and our ENL coordinator, Jessica Kruse-Cerutti.  Parents volunteers will also be invited to the after school program to work  in collaboration with  the teachers in order to learn and help support  language learning strategies.      Parent Engagement is a priority for our school community. Engaging parents of ENL and SLL  (Second Language Learners) in the academic process, is of  pivotal  importance to our students  academic achievement.  We believe that when parents  are given the guidance and support to  assist their children in developing  literacy and learning in two languages they then have the tools  necessary to make an impact on the success of their children.We achieve this by creating various  opportunities for parents to be informed and educated on the topics that address their needs. We  establish communication from the beginning of the year with our orientations, curriculum  night  and parent engagement sessions. During these occasions we ensure that high quality  educational materials are available in English, Spanish and French and that the teachers and the  Dual Language Coordinator share successful home learning activities with parents and answer  their questions.  A series of workshops on a variety of themes based on the needs outlined from  parents have been created . These  include;  homework help, language acquisition stages, literacy  strategies in both languages, content area strategies, use of resources as well as a scholarly study  of articles on dual language, and professional books studies.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Assessment tools our school uses to assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs include Fountas and Pinell reading levels English  and Spanish (K-1Spanish DLP classes), and TCRWP assessments. Progress is monitored on an ongoing basis. The data that is  derived from these assessments are used to plan and drive instruction, and to create student grouping.  Differentiated  instruction takes place in reading, writing and math in order to support and enrich all of our students.        2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?      Teachers will administer rigorous, CCLS-aligned performance-based writing tasks and use an agreed-upon school-wide writing  rubric and provide timely and useful feedback tied to such rubric. These rubrics will be used for our ELLs with scaffolding in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      order to make the rubric student accessible. Fountas and Pinnell evaluation K-5 will be used for developing ELL support  curriculum for our ELLs.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The assessment tools used to evaluate the success of the programs for ELLs are:  •     The print rich classroom environment  •     ELA and Math state exams in the Spring  •     End of Unit Assessments in both ELA and Math     •     ESL Periodic Assessments (Pearson) Fall and Spring  •     NYSESLAT in the Spring         4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?     Once the summative data has been collected, we will use the writing portion of the assessment and previous teacher writing  conference notes to assess whether students are incorporating feedback given in their writing to improve writing pieces in  summative assessments. The goal is for our ELLs to use the traits of 6+1 to increase one level on the writing continuum. For  the math exam for our ELLs we will determine if the issues are linguistic or academic based on answers and in which language  they completed the exam.  Our ELL teacher will create scaffolds to support the ELLs in math deficits.  From the NYSESLAT data  we will address interventions needed through scheduling classes ands students for ELL supports based on the langauge  domain that they need the most support with and those interventions will occur during pull-out and push-in sessions with the  ELL teacher.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Our school uses:  •     Oral language is developed by dramatic plays, Reader’s Theatre to act out stories, literacy centers, listening to stories on  CD or e-books.  •     Interactive Read-alouds  •     Teaching vocabulary in a concrete way by acting it out and using pictures  •     Teaching content academic language in context previewing key concepts and challenging vocabulary  •     Engage students in discussions about the big ideas of the text  •     Provide students with multicultural songs  •     Storytelling using wordless books         6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Fall NYSITELL scores show that the children who were tested and who are ELLs have scored on what specific level.  Based on  the Spring 2016 NYSESLAT, scores of those students have shown progress from entering to emerging or transitioning, and  transitioning to commanding have shown that there has been an increase in the listening and speaking strands. Students  continue to have difficulty with reading comprehension and with the writing prompts. We need to focus on these two strands  emphasizing on vocabulary, word fluency, comprehension,  and sentence structure/grammar.   During inquiry students are  grouped accordingly. Writing activities are differentiated in small groups. The ELL Periodic assessment that was administered  in the Fall gives a snapshot of what the teachers can do to support these students.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Scores are shared by the ENL teacher and with all the classroom teachers so meaningful interventions can be put in place  quickly and accurately to support our ELLs.  The scores are disseminated during grade team meetings and whole school PD  sessions. Data is handed out and shared with all teachers so adjustments can be made to our ELL program in order to better  meet ELL needs.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59               Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   The 2017-2018 school year we will serve children from monolingual and dual language classes, of which are ICT (Co- Team Teaching) classes, Self Contained class,  Kindergarten Spanish Self Contained Dual Language , First through fifth  grade French Side by side Dual Language,  First through fifth grade Spanish Self Contained  Dual Language class.  The  ENL program at PS 133 is a freestanding pull out / push in program.  The students receive all instruction in English with  language support.  Three hundred sixty (360) minutes total of ENL instruction is provided to all Entering and Emerging  level students; 180 minutes are ENL and 180 of the minutes are integrated with ELA.  Transitioning-level and  expanding-level students receive 180 minutes per week of ENL instruction, broken down by 90 minutes of stand alone  ENL and 90 minutes of integrated ENL minutes.  Expanding level ENL students receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL  services as per the CR Part 154.  For students that score at the commanding level receive 90 minutes of integrated  ENL support.               The ENL program incorporates content area learning using ENL methodology. Guided Reading, Shared Reading,  Independent Reading, Shared Writing, Independent Writing and Word Study are used to make content areas  comprehensible, with hands-on activities to assist the English Language Learner.  All lessons for ELLs are aligned with  New York City, State, and Common Core Learning Standards. To provide students with support in areas of  assessments there is continuous reinforcement of English Language Arts and Mathematics skills. There is an emphasis  on all four modalities:  reading, writing, speaking and listening.                     Classroom teachers use various graphic organizers, such as semantic webs, bubble maps, Venn diagrams, K- W-L charts which help the students with their reading comprehension and with the writing process. The Balanced  Literacy Approach and Workshop Model are consistently used in lessons. The ESL teacher uses the whole language  approach, scaffolding, intensive vocabulary instruction, Total Physical Response (TPR), and the Cooperative Learning  and Cognitive Academic Language Learning Approach (CALLA). There are leveled fiction and non-fiction libraries  available to all students, reflecting various genre and themes. During Writing Workshop, it is acceptable for students  to write in their native language.  This encourages the students to apply the new skills and techniques in their writing  without the fear of the new language.  Students are encouraged to use their native language skills to assist them in  learning English.                   When the ENL teacher analyzes the periodic assessments she shares the results with classroom  teachers.  The classroom teachers share the results of the TCRWP running records andFountas and Pinnell  with the  ENL teacher on an ongoing basis as well.        This ensures that the students are continually placed in correct groups and progressing in a timely fashion.                 b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      According to Part 154-2, English As a New Language Units of Study and Staffing requirements, three hundred sixty  (360) minutes total of ENL instruction is provided to all Entering and Emerging level students; 180 minutes are ENL  and 180 of the minutes are integrated with ELA.  Transitioning-level and expanding-level students receive 180 minutes  per week of ENL instruction, broken down by 90 minutes of stand alone ENL and 90 minutes of integrated ENL   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         minutes.  Expanding level ENL students receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL services as per the CR Part 154.  For  students that score at the commanding level receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL support.   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              ESL: Three hundred sixty (360) minutes of ESL instruction is provided to all beginning and intermediate level students.  Advanced-level students receive 180 minutes per week of ESL instruction and 180 minutes of ELA per week as per the CR Part  154.    Dual Language:  teach content in both languages throughout the day. They are required to teach English for the same amount  of minutes as the ESL teacher.    Dual Language class lessons are taught in French and Spanish on French days or Spanish days, and content area is taught in  English on English days.  The number of minutes for Native Language Arts instruction are adhered to 50/50 model.        3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      Content area instruction is taught through literacy in both Spanish and French in DLP classes.  Teachers intergrate science  and social studies and literacy units about a variety of topics as indicated in the curriculum plan.  Students are taught content- specific vocabulary lessons.  Vocabulary is reviewed orally.  Math is taught in English only.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      ELLs are evaluated in reading through running records in English; In Spanish, and in French.  For students whose native  language is other than French or Spanish we are looking for ways and tools to assess thier home language, comments  welcome.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Although we do not have any Students with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE) P.S. 133 will take into account that we will be  prepared to meet their needs. Just as we differentiate our lessons for our ELLs, these students will need additional support in  all areas. They will be given more time than other ELLs and will work with them one on one during the extra time given to  them.  Newcomers with less than three years will also be receiving extra support and time.  These students will be exposed to oral  English and practice using oral English, they will work on phonemic awareness, and activities using TPR (Total Physical  Response).  They are given academic support in their native language.  Listening to text for reading and listening  comprehenion, picture dictionaries, use of internet website such as Starfall.com and readingA-Z are things used to support our  newcomers.  Students in the program for 4 to 6 years will be using the CALLA methods to help them in the content areas and prepare them  for the state exams that are given and increase their scores. Students that are long term ELLs will work as the others and also  using the Language Experience Approach and students will academically and linguistically improve on their assessments.  The students who are former ELLs which are students who scored at a profieciency level on the NYSESLAT  are not entitled  to  ESL services.  They do, however  continue to receive support  as they transition.  For two consecutive years they will have ELL  test modifications.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Instructional strategies and grade-level materials that teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic content  are used in order to accelerate English Language development and the use of appropriate use of manipulatives, The SIOP  model utilized with students, and the use of computer websites specializing specifically with students with disabilities.  The  ENL teacher will attend ELL-SWDs IEP meetings in order to better support ELLs.  Students' IEPS will be used when planning for  instruction.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  We determine our school's curricular, instructional and schdeuling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDS by looking at each child's IEP  and working closely with the child's teacher. All children with special needs are served according to goals set forth in the IEP.  Depending on the child’s particular needs, he or she may be assigned to part-time special education in the resource room or  speech class, or full-time placement in a self-contained special education class. The ESL Teacher articulates with the SETSS,  Speech and Special Education teachers, as well as other classroom teachers to set and adjust the instructional program. Data  from the students’ performance on the NYSESLAT is used to determine skills that need strengthening. Special needs children  are included in mainstream groups for ESL service. A number of students who receive Resource Room or Speech services  continue to be served as ELLs in Dual Language (DL) classes. Such students:  •     are targeted for inclusion in academic intervention groups four times a week   •     are included in Title III ESL Extended Day program 4 hours a week for 9 weeks   •     are included in Extended Day programs for Reading and Math   •     develop skills using Wilson program, where needed   •     use AWARD Reading program materials  Speech/Language Instruction/Intervention Program at PS 46   • PS 133 provides Speech-Language services to children who have been diagnosed as having communication deficits in their  first language and English. • The Speech-Language Teacher/Therapist, along with the Speech Supervisor is sensitive to the  cultural and linguistic differences that affect the identification, assessment, treatment and management of communication  disorders/differences of our students. • The mono-lingual therapists at PS 133 have had approximately 21 hours of training in  multicultural issues and second language acquisition. • Students identified as dominant in their first language are provided  service from a certified bilingual speech-language pathologist. • Small group and individual therapy is provided to students  who are in the Dual Language Program as well as those in monolingual classes from Kindergarten to 5th grade.  •     Written reports are prepared incorporating information about the students’ cultural and linguistic influences.   •     Therapy is provided for simultaneous language learners, using current research and best practices in the treatment /  management of articulation, phonological, language disorders/delays, including various delivery models and options for  intervention.  Differentiation of Instruction in the Resource Room As a Special Education Teachers differentiate instruction by  content, process and product. When students come to these teachers, they are assessed in order to determine their readiness,  interests and learning styles. Students who have decoding and encoding problems are introduced to the Wilson Reading  System which is a multisensory, step –by –step, structured, sequential language program designed to help struggling readers.  Lessons in the Wilson Reading System are divided into three blocks:      1 .Word Study 2. Spelling 3. Listening Comprehension The lessons in the Wilson Readers are graded to suit each student  needs. There are twelve readers in the series. Every student begins from Student Reader One. Wilson Reading uses tapping in  order to decode words. The Wilson program includes phonics, phonemic awareness, vocabulary, fluency and comprehension.  Formative assessments are done to determine if a student should continue to the next sub-step. A summative assessment is  done at the end of each student reader. Students work in small groups of four or five or individually based on the students’  readiness interests and learning profile. Students are taught Mathematics using concrete materials and visual aids. The Over – head Projector as well as the Smart Board is sometimes used to demonstrate lessons. Lessons are taught using a thematic  approach that is related to real life situations. Instruction is more of an investigative nature that allows for group sharing.  There is accountable talk in which the teacher allows for a variety of responses.  Students’ interests and strengths are considered when assigning work. Students are given extended time to complete  assignments or fewer problems based on their strengths or weaknesses. Assignments contain directions that are clear and  direct enough for students to understand. Directions are read and re-read aloud based on students needs.  Self-contained Special Education Students who are in self-contained classes receive ESL instruction according to their IEP. The   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62      Special Education teachers have received training so that they can use appropriate scaffolding for ELLs. The ESL teacher  collaborates with the self-contained classroom teachers to make sure that the ELL instruction is congruent with their  educational plan. As much as possible, these students are included in ESL groups with students from mainstream classes. ELLS  IN self-contained special education classes, like those in Resource Room and Speech,  In after school, ELL students receive additional support 3-4 times a week, by receiving assistance with their homework,  reading, math, social skills and vocabulary development through social interaction.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Targeted intervention programs for our ELLs are AIS, Inquiry Groups, after school, Art / Social Studies, Setts.  The ENL  curriculum also includes a Math word wall and an intervention program during school hours.  Our school utilizes Drop  Everything And Read (DEAR time) where we encourage students to build reading stamina and utilize reading strategies on their  own. In the lower grades, an outside agency tutors first graders in reading and writing. Finally, we practice      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      There aren’t any programs that will be discontinued.  ELLs are given the same opportunity to participate in any program  available, whether academic or enrichment.  Programs provided to all English Language Learners (In English)  are:  •Physical Education, Science, Music, Spanish (Kindergarten and First Grade)  •Studio-In-The-School   Junior Great Books  •Computer Enrichment  •Enrichment Club Fridays  •Cookshop For Kids  -Play works  -Creative Statges (Third Grade).

If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   None.       11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are afforded equal accommodation to the rest of the schools program.  They ar invited to participate in any school  activity. Programs which ELLs are included in our school are listed above.   Morning Math/Chess organized by Judi Hudson our  Music teacher , and on Wednesday and Thursday the Physical Eduation teacher has a program that promotes healthy choices.  Play Works is a leadership opportunity program for students. Early Bird 7:30-8:15 Tuesday and Wednesday to strengthen Math  and ELA skills. In addition, for testing grades, we have Saturday academy, where teachers prepare students for the state tests  using a variety of different strategies.        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Instructional materials used to support the ELLs include the Teachers College Reading and  Writing project, Big Books for Shared reading, Words Their Way activity books.  Some technology programs are funbrain, IXL  for math, Math Blaster, Brainpop, and softschool. Native language support is provided through our multicultural library.  There  are bilingual glossaries that are available for classroom use.  There are also picture dictionaries, Ready Gen and  Go Math  books that include ELL support.              13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Native language in the ENL is supported by the ENL teacher since she is able to translate into Spanish whenever  necessary.  The students use the buddy system to support each other.  In the Dual Language classes in the morning are taught  in French and Spanish. In the afternoon content area is taught in English the DLP classes. In the dual language program, we also  follow the side-by side model        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Depending on the students English acquisition service support and resources correspond to ELLs' ages and grade levels.  When  ordering NYSESLAT preparation materials they are grade and age appropriate since we focus on the bands being tested.                 15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Instructional materials used to support the ELLs include the Teachers College Reading and  Writing project, Big Books for Shared reading, Words Their Way activity books.  Some technology programs are funbrain, IXL  for math, Math Blaster, Brainpop, and softschool. Native language support is provided through our multicultural library.  There  are bilingual glossaries that are available for classroom use.  There are also picture dictionaries, Ready Gen and  Go Math  books that include ELL support.              16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   At the beginning of the school year, PS 133 holds a Parent Orientation for the parents to meet the Parent Coordinator,  teachers, nurse and other and other staff that will be working with their students. At this meeting, we inform the parents of  our expectations. There is also an open house and tour of the school. During this meeting, parents along with their children are  given information about services that are available to them.        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Language electives that are offered to ELLs are French dance (afterschool) for Kindergarten, as well as French-language clubs  on Fridays.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64         18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   The Dual language model used in the school's kindergarten French program is side-by-side.  Students  form two groups of approximately 20 students, half of which are designated "francophones" (according  to pre-entrance testing) and half of which are designated "anglophones".  Each student spends one day in  a French-language classroom, and one day in an english-language classroom.  The only class that is always  taught in English is Math.  The emergent literacy taught is sequential.  This necessitates that students be  regrouped during their literacy block, and francophone students receive literacy instruction in French  (whereas anglophones receive literacy instruction in English).  This means that ELLs and EPs spend 24/58  of their time learning in French and 34/58 of their time learning in English (the formula was derived in the  following way: 29 periods/week x 2weeks of 5 days [to even out the number of days spent in each  language]minus the 10 periods spent in math [English-only], divided by two [because they are in an  English-only classroom every other day] equals 24 periods  during a two-week cycle spent in French, or 12  periods, each of 45 minutes, spent in French each week.  The other 17 classroom periods are spent in  English, meaning that these students spend 17x 45 minutes, or twelve hours and 45 minutes in English  each week).  The only time that the groups are taught separately is during their literacy block, as they  learn literacy in their native language first (the sequential model).  Instruction language is separated by  teacher and by location.  The Dual language model used in the school's First grade French program is also side by side. This year,  the second and third grades dual language Frecnch and Spanish were self contained. In a self contained  model, the mornings are spent in the Target language, whereas, in the afternoon math and social studies  are taught in English.  The emergent literacy taught is sequential.  In the morning lessons are taught in  French and in the afternoon Math is done in English, along with all other afternoon lessons.  All afternoon  lessons are taught in English, as are all lessons taught by specialty teachers.  This means that of the 28  periods during which these students are with their classroom teacher (not including lunch, specialty  teacher classes, and Friday clubs), half are taught in French and half are taught in English.              Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  1. Professional development for Ell personnel  is presented by members of our staff, or resource people who are involved with  special programs in our school.  Some workshops include topics like assessments, class walk-throughs, request made by  teachers for the ENL teacher participates in professional development workshops offered by the department of Educations  Office of English Language Learners. These workshops support the ENL teacher in ways she can develop strategies she will be  able to turnkey to classroom teachers that work with ELLs.  Classroom teachers are offered professional development through  OELL website.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65            2. Teachers of ELLs  are given the opportunity to attend Professional Development offered to them explaining  changes in the  NYSESLAT and NYSITELL.  This Professional Development Increases the knowledge of the NYSESLAT and helps gain a deeper  understanding how aligned with the Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS as well as classrooom instructional implications  and practices.     3. For 2017-2018 our ENL provider is registered to be part of the Sole ENL provider study group for district 13.  This study  group works with ENL providers who are the only ENL provider in their school.  Our ENL provider will also meet five times  during the year with the ELL service administrators for district 13, in order to get resources and stay attuned to ELL compliance  issues.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.     3. The School Guidance Counselor, Ms. Clark and Mr. Dickerson, the Parent Coordinator, and speech, occupational and physical  therapists, are involved in the professional development that help to guide our ELL through the transition from elementary  school to middle school. The ENL teacher uses the DOE translation services to translates materials into students home  language or if needed makes sure there are translations available.              4. As per the Jose P. Compliance  Monolingual teachers will receive ongoing professional development informing them of  preparations for the NYSESLAT.  Teachers will be given information for ENL new teacher credits, ENL strategies and NYS  standards for ENL.  Regular teachers receive 7.5 hours of instruction on ENL methodologies and Special Education teachers  receive 10 hours.  In the ENL classroom, the ENL teacher maintains a professional resource library for teachers and provides  timely support for building curriculum to meet various leveled ELLs..  Children First Network (CFN) will provide training, and  staff will attend available workshops to meet required hours.  There are agendas and attendance maintained when hours are  given. A letter is placed in their professional files when hours are completed.      Various workshops were conducted throughout the year  that are available to all Educators who work with ELLs.  -Maria Boutllion/DLP is an outside resource our school uses to support our DLP classes and ELLs.                      Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   In our school parents are encouraged to visit and spend time in their child’s classroom.  At the beginning of the school year, all  our parents are invited to attend Parent Teas welcoming them to the school and to their child's  classroom.  Parents are  encouraged to attend writing celebrations and assemblies, and to work with the class on First Fridays.  Parents also have  coffee chats with the principal on these First Fridays. Our PTA president keeps teachers and parents informed of activities  taking place in the school via P.S. 133 PTA Email. The ESL teacher and Parent Coordinator will help parents with all issues.  They  will be given the opportunity to attend classes which will teach them how to assist their child with school work, test  preparation and more throughout the school year.  Translations will be available as needed. The parents needs are also met by  teachers who are in constant contact with them.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66              2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   1. Parents  are given the opportunity to attend workshops that inform them about Test Prep, choosing Middle schools, and  promotional policies.  ARIS Parent Link is a computer based evaluation system that is available to all our parents as well.  Mr.  Dickerson signs each parent up, and the link is available in the parent’s native language.      2. The parents have access to the computers in our school parent room.  Through ARIS link parents can track their child's  progress.  Our parents are very involved in our school community through volunteering, the Parent-Teacher Association, and  the School Leadership Team (SLT).  The PTA and the School Leadership team meet once a month.  During these meetings all  parents are invited to attend, including parents of ELLs.    3. Parents are given a needs assessment at the beginning of the school year.  This will help to know what our parents want to  know, how they can support the school and what expectations they have of our school.       4.Parents at PS 133 have volunteered and do participate in various activities sponsored by the school such as Class Parents  (liaisons between teacher and families), Hispanic Heritage assembly, Parents as reading partners, Parents as math partners,  Cook shop for parents (helps them prepare healthy foods for their children)  Thanksgiving Celebration, Multicultural  celebrations.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Heather Foster-mann, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PS 133                                                                              School DBN:     Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
