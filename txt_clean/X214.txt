The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7     In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           8       NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           10   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Section 4: SCEP Overview               The Lorraine Hansberry Academy P.S / M.S 214 is located in the West Farms section of the Bronx. The school is  organized into three mini-academies; the Early Childhood Program, Elementary School and Middle School which all  adhere to the mission statement and focus on the developmental states of learning.      Vision Statement:   Our students will be committed to high levels of learning throughout life and will make positive contributions to the  global society.      Mission Statement:   To achieve our vision, we believe that our responsibility is based on a deep commitment to provide rigorous learning  opportunities through a community-wide social-emotional approach, so that all students achieve at high levels.      Theory of Action:   If the school provides teachers and staff with systemic learning opportunities grounded in sustaining academic rigor,  and engaging learners in quality interactions, school-wide instructional practices will be enhanced. As a result,  students will achieve increasingly higher levels of learning.   If students’ daily learning experiences are driven by high standards and academic rigor, supported by careful scaffolds  and structured interactions, students will learn to read, write and think critically across all disciplines.   Instructional Focus:    Expose students to a large volume and wide range of writing experiences across all subjects.            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   We foster a diverse population of students as well as teachers and staff. The student demographics are comprised of:   25% African American 11% English Language Learners       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           11      70% Hispanic 18% Special Education Students   1% Caucasian 51% Male students enrolled   2 % Asian 49% Female students enrolled   1% American Indian      The average attendance rate for the school year 2017-2018 is 92%.      Our school's areas of strength was demonstrated by a 5% increase in reading proficiency as measured by the 2015-16  ELA state exam. The SWD subgroup scored higher than the ELL subgroup within levels 3's and 4's on the 2015-16  mathematics exam.       The students at P.S. 214 are provided with a safe and structured environment that promotes active learning alongside  positive social relationships with peers and adults. We honor our mission and fully believe that learners warrant a  developmentally appropriate social emotional approach. Our students in Pre-K - 5th grade partake in morning  meetings based on The Morning side Center’s “4Rs” curriculum, while students in grades 6 - 8th grade complete the  “Be the Change” curriculum which are both literacy based, focusing on themed units that encompass activities where  students learn how to handle themselves and also seeks to create a caring environment among all. Community-wide  we offer a host of programs that benefit each of our three mini- academies individually and inclusively.      Featured Programs are as follows:   The Early Childhood Program Pre-K - 2:     Bent On Learning Yoga - addresses the physical, social and emotional state of students in urban education   (trained yoga instructors around the city teach yoga principles and practices).     NYC Ballet – brings the art of ballet to our school.

Our school's areas of strength was demonstrated by a 5% increase in reading proficiency as measured by the 2015-16  ELA state exam. The SWD subgroup scored higher than the ELL subgroup within levels 3's and 4's on the 2015-16  mathematics exam.           2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           13      Area of Need:   ELL subgroups scored 3.4% or lower within the area of level 3's and 4's as measured by the ELA state exam.   ELL subgroups scored 0% within levels 3 and 4 on the 2015-16 Mathematics exam.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   At the Lorraine Hansberry Academy we pride ourselves on a distinctive school culture which is based on high  expectations. The strength of our school is grounded in the work of our revamped innovative teacher teams and  professional learning communities, which bring a wealth of knowledge and experience. We believe that academic  achievement is the road to college and career readiness. We continue to use strategic practices to learn and grow  using student achievement as the center of all initiatives and endeavors. This enables us to lead students to success  by committing to a challenging curriculum that produces rigorous learning opportunities based on student needs and  interests.   Our cohorts of teachers meet during professional time to engage in common planning with discussions in areas  informed by the instructional shifts and Danielson’s Framework for Teaching. Teacher teams in Pre-K – 5th grade  meet a minimum of two times a week and 6-8th grades meet every day. The planning time that is built into the  teacher’s schedule affords each team an opportunity to:           Establish knowledge of content and resources    Create pacing calendars    Analyze the curriculum using Understanding by Design to make instructional adjustments using a   standardized unit plan template     Develop evaluative, reflective and coherent lesson plans aligned to the CCLS    Analyze data for the purpose of differentiation and tiered learning activities     Sharing best practices for instruction   We have implemented a professional learning community where our educators work collaboratively in recurring  cycles of collective inquiry and action research to achieve better results for the students they serve and to improve  results across each grade. This affords each team an opportunity to:           Develop an inquiry focus, examine the standards, create tasks to administer    Analyze tasks based on student work and define gaps across the grade    Take action: develop, implement and analyze focused lessons where data drives the instruction    Analyze data using the locally developed Learning Path Tool and the Team Meeting Protocols to determine   next steps.     Monitor student progress    Engage in external research and resources    New for 2016-2017 in Middle School interdisciplinary teams will engage in cycles of professional learning to   achieve the aforementioned.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           14      We believe that if we provide students with the necessary supports to address learning barriers, we can positively  impact their higher-order thinking skills and problem solving abilities thus leading to an increase in student  achievement.      The relationship between our mission statement and the identified needs of the school helps to drive our push  toward improving student achievement. The NYC DOE K – 8 School Quality Snapshot indicates that:           15% met state standards on the State English test; the average score was 2.3 out of 4.5.    24% met state standards on the State Math test; the average score was 2.4 out of 4.5.   However, our school scored higher than the district average which was 11% for the State English test and our students  achieved higher than the district average of 14% for the State Math test. We will continue to improve and strengthen  our practices so that we can close the achievement gap.   Additionally, the great work that we do here at P.S 214 is recognized as a host school through the Learning Partners  Program. The program is designed to promote inter-school collaborative learning and leverage the rich reservoir of  expertise that already resides within our school communities to improve the educational experience for all New York  City students. Our school is a host school since 2014, and collaborates with schools throughout four of the five  boroughs in New York City. We are also partnered with the Middle School Quality Initiative (MSQI), which supports  schools in developing literacy in young adolescents, ultimately preparing them for success in high school and college.                   2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           15      School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 12X214   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05,06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   1078   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Teachers develop and ensure that unit and lesson plans used include data-driven instruction  (DDI) protocols that are appropriately aligned to the CCLS and NYS content standards and  address student achievement needs.  The school leader and teachers have developed a comprehensive plan for teachers to partner  within and across all grades and subjects to create interdisciplinary curricula targeting the  arts, technology, and other enrichment opportunities.

Strengths      In October 2017, our school received a Quality Review with a rating of “Well Developed” in 6 of 10 indicators,  including 4 that directly speak to Rigorous Instruction - Instructional Core (1.1) and Systems of Improvement (1.3, 4.1,  4.2).    The school has been engaged in ongoing work around checking for understanding and providing students with high- quality feedback. The Quality Review Report for 2017-2018 notes that QR Indicator 2.2, Assessment, is Proficient. The  report notes that “teachers used a variety of methods to continually check for understanding.” Forms of checking for  understanding included checklists, anecdotal notes, individual conferences, exit tickets, self-assessment, and on-the-      2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           18      spot small groups. “The rubrics, assessments, and grading policies that are employed by the leaders and teachers are  aligned to the schools’ curricula.”    Priority Needs      The Quality Review Report for 2017-2018 notes that QR Indicator 1.2, Pedagogy, is Proficient, and identifies it as the  Area of Focus.       The report notes that “student ownership of their learning was not yet evident across grades.”    In Competency 3d, 19% of teachers were rated Effective in 2017-2018 as of May 1, 2018. This indicates a need for  targeted professional development to fine-tune the use of the structures already in place. Additionally, as of May  2018, 0% of teachers were rated Highly Effective for 3d. This indicates an absence of a clear and consistent system for  establishing goals or for students to understand their goals. Students need to better self-assess and monitor their  own progress.      The above findings have informed our development of the vision, goal and action plan below for the Rigorous  Instruction element of the Framework for Great Schools.              Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Rigorous Instruction. Your goal must be responsive to the identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   Improve formative assessment of learning to differentiate learning for all by creating school-wide systems for goal- setting, teacher feedback to students, student self-assessment. Teachers will accommodate students' learning needs  through flexible groupings and tiered assignments, as measured by a 10% increase of students achieving grade level  proficiency at each benchmark by June 2019.          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           19     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies your  school will implement to achieve the identified goal for this  Framework for Great Schools element, including:   Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

Strategies to address the needs of students with  disabilities, English language learners, and other high-need  student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, SIFE,  STH).   Refine and expand the use of content area rubrics within subjects.  Ensure student understanding of the content area rubrics.      Implement accountable talk protocols, the Socratic Seminar  approach (i.e. fishbowl, debate, etc.), and Reciprocal Reading to  allow students to initiate whole class, small group, and partner  discussions and pose original DOK questions with minimal teacher  support / direction.      Expand work that began in PK-5 in the prior school year on  implementing student-friendly Learning Targets to the middle school  to create a coherent school-wide system that includes student  action and assessment.   Create interdisciplinary team (middle school) and grade team (PK-5)  and adapt the TC checklist and writing rubric to be usable in all  subjects.   Consistently share mentor pieces to enable students to better  understand the criteria for success.

What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?   Strengths   For the 2017-2018 school year, two points of celebration for our school were the implementation of the mood meters  during morning meeting, and the integration of teacher leaders into the Youth Development team. The success of  such implementation has been reflected in the Online Occurrence Reporting System, as of May 1, 2018. The rate for  level 4, aggressive or injurious, harmful behaviors, has reduced by 40% from 2016-2017 to 2017-2018 school year. The  rate for level 5, seriously dangerous or violent behaviors, has greatly dropped by 50% from 2016-2017 to 2017-2018  school year.   Priority Needs    For the 2018-2019 school year, we will promote the practice of transferring the SEL skills throughout the day for all  stakeholders. Greater teacher buy-in is needed to support students’ SEL development. As the 2017-2018 Quality  Review Indicator 1.4, Positive Learning Environment, specified that advisory programs ensure teachers and students  spend ample time working closely together on a variety of social and academic issues such as dealing with friendship       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           24      and stress, developing good listening skills, as well as internalizing conflict resolution strategies. The reduction of  level 4 and level 5 incident and suspension reports aligned with another QR 1.4 notation “improvement in student  behavior is resulting as students are taking ownership through the skills they are learning in the advisory program.”  By strengthening the 4Rs Curriculum in elementary school and advisory program in the middle school, we can not  only expect to see continuous improvement in level 4 and level 5 suspensions but also decrease the disciplinary  infractions in level 1 uncooperative/noncompliant behaviors, level 2 disorderly behaviors, and level 3 disruptive  behaviors, too. As of May 1, 2018 online occurrence report, from 2016-2017 to 2017-2018, level 1 behaviors have  increased 17%, level 2 behaviors have increased 10%, and level 3 behaviors have increased 13%.

The report noted that “all school curriculum  is aligned to the Common Core,” and that “teachers often come together to make adjustments to the curricula.”  Reviewers noted that lesson plans showed multiple points of entry and additional supports for Students with  Disabilities and English Language Learners.   Priority Needs   According to the 2016-2017 New York State Report Card for PS 214, the school did not meet Adequate Yearly Progress  targets for all accountability groups for English Language Arts, Mathematics, or Science. Seeing as this is despite  aligning the curriculum for Common Core and adjusting it to meet the needs of SwD and ELLs, further refinements are  needed.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           30      The school has already developed means for regular edits of the curriculum using Google Drive.

All teachers and paraprofessionals participate in professional-learning cycles running in six-week  cycles on Mondays.           2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the strategies and activities for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, staff, and  paraprofessionals that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).      The strategies and activities listed below have been put in place to ensure that staff receives high quality professional  development to improve instruction, thus enabling our students to meet the Common Core Learning Standards:          Supervisors conduct ongoing feedback aligned with the Danielson Rubric  Supervisors in collaboration with teachers develop individual professional growth plans for teachers  Supervisors meet with individual teachers three times a year to reflect on progress of professional goals.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           55         Supervisory staff meet individually with staff to review student data and develop plans for improving both  instruction and student achievement     Teacher teams are scheduled for common planning periods to design and adjust curriculum in alignment with   CCLS.  In-house professional development cycles have been established to provide year-round support to teachers  and paraprofessionals.  Foci for professional development are chosen by teachers and supervisors based on instructional needs  towards student achievement.  Inter-visitations are scheduled so teachers can observe best practices within the school and at other schools.       Model teachers will welcome other teachers for inter-visitations in their classrooms.    Teacher teams adjust units and lessons on an ongoing basis to meet the needs of ELLs and SWDs.     School wide implementation of Team Meeting Protocols to examine both student work and assessment data  to develop unit plans and make curriculum and instructional adjustments aligned to CCLS and student needs.   School wide implementation of The Learning Path tool to identify areas of needs and areas of growth in  classes and across grade bands to enhance instruction aligned to the CCLS.              Teachers provide feedback on professional development activities and suggest next steps.    Professional learning is facilitated by administration, coaches, volunteer teachers and consultants.    Administrators monitor the effectiveness of Professional Development activities in the classroom through the   Professional Development Survey.        Part 3: TA Schools Only   3a. Use of Program Resources   Describe how the TA program resources will assist participating children to meet proficiency.  N/A        3b. TA Coordination with the Regular Program   Describe the planning, coordination and support of the TA program with the regular educational program (i.e.,  providing ELT, accelerated, high-quality curriculum, including applied learning; and minimize removing children from  the regular classroom during regular school day).  N/A        Part 4: SWP Schools Only   4a. Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/information,  early intervention services, etc.).  Pre-K teachers work collaboratively with kindergarten teachers throughout the year. Professional development  activities permit teachers to be trained together while having opportunities to discuss curriculum and student needs.  Pre-K teachers inter-visit in kindergarten classrooms so they have an opportunity to prepare their students for the  transition to kindergarten.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           56      Parent workshops focused on the skills students will need upon entering kindergarten, are held during the fall and  spring of the school year. These hands-on workshops provide parents with CCLS aligned activities they can make/do at  home to strengthen foundational skills.   The pre-k social worker, assigned to the school weekly, provides parents with information regarding academic and  social expectations for kindergarten.      In order to foster the transition process to kindergarten, the Pre-K staff develop and implement a transition  unit of study at the end of the school year.     Parent workshops focused on the skills students will need upon entering kindergarten, are held during the fall   and spring of the school year. These hands-on workshops provide parents with CCLS aligned activities they  can make/do at home to strengthen foundational skills.     The pre-k social worker, assigned to the school, provides parents with information regarding academic and   social expectations for kindergarten.     Pre-K Parents are provided an opportunity to attend a Kindergarten Orientation to aid in the transition   process. Parents are able to meet future kindergarten teachers as well as obtain information regarding the  kindergarten program.     The school has partnered with Parent Corps to engage and support parents, children and pre-k staff to  promote social emotional learning that develops foundational skills for learning to enter kindergarten.        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.        Teacher teams work collaboratively to develop formative and summative assessment instruments. Teacher teams in  collaboration with the instructional coaches and administrators determine appropriate school-wide measures. All  staff members have received professional development on utilizing data from assessments to drive instruction and  group students.      Professional development is offered to teachers during the year through professional learning cycles        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           58        Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           59      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS 214, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      Lorraine Hansberry Academy- PS 214X will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students         · providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   · providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   · fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           60      · providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   · sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   · providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      The school’s Parent Involvement      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.         In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:      · actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   · engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated directly  to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   · ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   · support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;   · maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.

All targeted students are both ELL and immigrant.  The narrative and schedule are below.  MORNING PROGRAM - TITLE III IMMIGRANT ONLY  Our Expanding ELLs who were born outside of the USA in grades 3-5 remained at the same  proficiency level in comparison to the previous year’s NYSESLAT. Non-ELLs and former ELLs  who were born outside of the USA did not score Level 3 or 4 on the NYS ELA or MATH in the  past two years. During the Morning Learning Program, we will provide immigrant students with  additional services aimed at improving their language skills.  The Morning Learning Program for immigrant students in grades 3-5 will be offered  Wednesdays and Fridays from November 2 to June 21, from 7:30 am to 8:00 am for the total  of  29 hours. (See dates below). Instruction will be provided by Wojciech Schneider, a certified  ENL teacher. The language of instruction will be English. Translated versions of the interactive  texts will be available.  The instructional focus is to provide students with direct instruction in vocabulary/words study,  reading comprehension skills/strategies, writing, speaking and listening skills. The areas of need  will be determined based on the most recent formative and summative assessments.  Students will be provided with online leveled reading through the use of Kindle e-readers with  the Raz-Kids reading website from Reading A-Z. The interactive component of the readers along  with the narration and dictionary increases student comprehension and engagement. For students  who may need to become familiar with translated versions of texts, Raz-Kids provides Spanish  versions with the same interactive features.

EXTENSION OF TITLE III SUPPLEMENTAL PROGRAM  DATES ARE THE ADDITIONAL DATES  Begin description here:       Our Entering and Emerging students continue to struggle, per the results on the 2018 NYS Math  and Science, despite first language supports being available to them for the tests.  Only one ELL  in this subgroup received a 3 on the NYS Science in 2018, and in the target grade band of 6-8  grade, and no student in this subgroup received a 3 or 4 on the NYS Math in 2018.  We currently  have 19 students in this subgroup and our 6th grade receives students from many schools; we  project inviting about 28 students.  The program may be expanded to include Transitioning  students, who have similar results, based on enrollment.  The program will have two co-taught classes, one for science and one for math.  There will be an  ENL teacher paired with a certified math teacher for one, and an ENL teacher paired with a  certified science teacher for the other.  The four teachers will co-plan for the program during the  Title III LEP Professional Development series.  The math teacher will use Science A-Z for instruction, as well as teacher created materials.  The  math teacher will use teacher-created materials, supplemented with IXL.com for differentiated  instruction on student levels.  Both teachers are fluent in Spanish and can also provide instruction  in English.  The ENL teachers will use materials from Flocabulary, as well as Reading A-Z.  The  ENL teachers will also configure and use Google G Suite for Education with students, enabling  them to create projects and presentations.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  To assess the early literacy skills of the ELL students our school uses Fountas and Pinnell (F & P) on K-5. This assessment allows  teachers to gain insight into the current reading level and reading strategies utilized by the ELLs and plan appropriate  instruction. In grades 6-8, the Degrees of Reading Progress (DRP) assessment is administered 3x a year, and the scores are  used to identify a start point for Teachers College Reading and Writing Project (TCRWP) running records.  Middle school  teachers use this process to identify the current reading levels of students, as well as strengths and needs to address in  planning.  Additionally, teacher-created end-of-unit assessments have been integrated into the reading portion of the TCRWP  curriculum, which is in use here on K-8.  These in-house assessments are scanned into Datacation and are immediately       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           75      available to teachers for item analysis.  This allows teachers to closely monitor students' progress and adjust their plans as  necessary.   We have met AYP for ELLs in Mathematics this year.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The K-2 Literacy Coach, the 3-5 RTI Coach, and the 6-8 ELA coach coordinate a school wide effort to ensure that the  assessments in #1 are administered to all students.  The ELL Team (Assistant Principal of ELLs, 2 ENL teachers) provide the  RLAT report and reports generated in-house to classroom teachers & cluster teachers K-5 and all teachers in the middle school  to ensure that teachers are aware of students levels.  The ELL Team also provides PD to all teachers on the RLAT and EDAT to  ensure that teachers can triangulate the literacy data with ELL information like years of service and year-over-year progress to  identify appropriate supports for students and create small groups.  The ELL Team meets once a week to look at needs of ELL  students and teachers of ELLs in order to plan curricular and PD supports.  Based on assessed needs of students, the ELL Team  may modify the PD plan for the year so that teachers receive the most appropriate guidance and support.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  In grades 3-8, teachers administer the Fall and Spring NYC ELA Benchmark assessments.  This year, the we have also begun to  implement the NYC DOE ELL Benchmark assessments.  In 2018-2019, we will administer the ELL Benchmark in the fall, winter,  and early spring.  The fall assessment will be created in-house as there are only two ELL Benchmark tests available through  SchoolNet.   F&P Benchmarks are used to measure progress.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Teachers in K-5 have common planning one period per week. This period is used for inquiry work using the school-created  Critical Learning Path Tool to analyze student data, create groups based on data, and identify strengths, needs, and supports  for each group.  Data examined during common planning includes all TCRWP/Datacation reading assessments, NYC ELA  Benchmarks, and NYC ELL Benchmarks.  The middle school teachers dedicate all Tuesday common planning periods for this  work.  All teachers are expected to maintain a Data Binder with student assessment data, item analysis, and Critical Learning  Path Tools to assess each modality for our ELLs.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Our school uses data (NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, ELA, Fountas and Pinnell, Degrees of Reading Progress, TCRWP running records,  unit tests, etc.) to provide high quality instruction for ELLs within RTI. Fountas and Pinnell, for example, is used by ENL and  classroom teachers during Reading Workshop to group students accordning to their reading level. The NYSESLAT data is used  to plan instruction that targets specific ELLs'needs in the Speaking, Listening, Reading, and Writing modalities. Thanks to these  data points the teacher can adjust instruciton according to specific student needs. This allows for monitoring whether students  are responding to in-class interventions. The role of the ENL teacher is to analyze the data from the standpoint of a TESOL  professional with focus on the process of second language acquisition. The ENL teachers assures that the interventions are  ELL-appropriate. This Tier I intervention takes place throughout the day including the time when push-in ENL services are  delivered. If progress is not made despite intervention, the teachers can determine whether to continue providing other  interventions or to submit an RTI Referral Form to the administration to convene the RTI Committee to discuss the student's  case.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   We use data from all NYS assessments taken by our students to evaluate and inform our ELL program (NYSITELL, NYSESLAT,  ELA, Science, and Math).  At the start of the school year, the RLAT file is downloaded and printed for review by the ELL Team  (AP of ELLs and ENL teachers), and an updated EDAT file is created and similarly made available.  Using these sources of data,  the team decides on next steps.  For example, last year we identified the students that had gone backwards on the NYSESLAT,  and targeted them for intensive small group work during the school day and in Title III programs.  We also created a Title III       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           76         STEM program in response to low scores on the NYS Math and Science.  Data from these assessments can also lead to a  different configuration of the Stand-Alone ENL classes.  For example, this past year we put all of the students who had several  years of service but were still Entering or Emerging in one group for targeted intervention.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The findings of the team are shared with the other administrators, coaches, and teachers.  The ELL team makes copies of the  RLAT and EDAT and distributes them at the start of the school year.  The ELL team will continue this coming year to lead  professional development on reading, analyzing, and creating instructional next steps from the RLAT and EDAT.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   All ELL students (Entering-Commanding) in grades K-8 are grouped heteregenously in graded blocks. They receive four  periods (180 minutes) of integrated ENL with the ESOL teacher pushing-in to their content area class--primarily ELA.  An additional unit of standalone ENL instruction (180 minutes) is provided to Entering and Emerging ELLs in ungraded  heterogenous groups, combining students of no more than two corresponding grade bands (i.e. Grades K, 1-2, 3-4, 5- 6 and 7-8) by a certified ESOL teacher. They are pulled out four periods a week for standalone ENL instruction.  TC  Workshop model is used for both settings.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     NA   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      NA      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?     All ELL students (Entering-Commanding) in grades K-8 are grouped heterogenously in graded blocks. They receive four periods  (180 minutes) of integrated ENL with the ENL teacher pushing-in to their content area class--primarily ELA. An additional unit  of standalone ENL instruction (180 minutes) is provided for Entering and Emerging ELLs in heterogenous groups, combining  students of no more than two corresponding grade bands (i.e. Grades K, 1-2, 3-4, 5-6 and 7-8) by a certified ESOL teacher.At  this time, HLA is not delivered to students; however, all standalone and integrated ENL courses offer native language  texts/supports for students to ensure entry points to the curriculum.  Workshop model is used.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.     In the elementary school and middle school all core content (ELA, Math, Science, Social Studies) is delivered by common  branch K-6 teachers/content area teachers, except in ELA. In ELA, core content is taught by a certified ESOL teacher pushing-      2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           77      in/team-teaching with a common branch K-6 teacher or certified ELA content teacher. Often in the middle school, the certified  ELA content teacher that is teamed with the certified ESOL teacher speaks Spanish.    The language of instruction is English; although, there is native language support and other scaffolds (i.e. audio versions of  texts) provided by either the ESOL teacher or certified ELA teacher as needed to foster language development and access to  curriculum for ELLs. All content area instruction is aligned to the CCLS.    The ESOL teacher works closely with common branch/ELA content teachers that they are partnered with when providing  integrated ENL instruction. The ESOL teacher attends daily common planning sessions and embeds language objectives in  reading and writing lessons. Furthermore, the ESOL teacher provides appropriate accommodation/scaffolds, differentiated  according to ENL proficiency level, to ensure language objectives are met/assessed and ELLs have access to grade-level  curriculum.  The ENL teacher plans small group instruction for the Integrated ELA periods.    The ENL teachers provides professional development for integrated ENL teachers/content area teachers on the SIOP method  and its components. These professional development sessions detail how characteristics of ELLs and how they acquire new  language, stress the importance of language objectives/ensuring each lesson accounts for student practice in each of the four  language modalities. SIOP PDs focus on components/features of the SIOP method, providing models (i.e. sample objectives,  concept webs, graphic organizers), assessing/critiquing lessons and revising their own lessons/practice by incorporating SIOP  features. Past PDs have included: distinguishing between content and language objectives, building background knowledge,  strategies to increase ELL engagement/interaction, etc.    Moreover, the middle school ENL teacher has begun to work more closely with the social studies department.  The team will  review commonalities/trends between NYC ELL Benchmark Assessments and Social Studies MOSL data. The team uses this  data to incorporate targeted language objectives and devise strategies/accommodations based on SIOP/ELL methodologies to  address ELL areas of weakness in language.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   After new ELLs have been identified through the HLIS and NYSITELL, they are given the Spanish Lab assessment (when SP is  their L1). There is no baseline home language evaluation for languages other than Spanish. There are no interim assessments  throughout the year to evaluate students' progress in home language proficiency (Spanish or other L1). However, the ENL  teacher, integrated ENL ELA teacher and Spanish as a Foreign Language Teacher meet weekly to informally discuss the  progress, strategies that are working and concerns of middle school ELLs in the Spanish/standalone ENL/integrated ENL  classes.  Translated State Exams.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status      a. SIFE    Currently, our school has eight students labeled as SIFE. ENL teachers receive training through professional development  workshops on SIFE identification and early assessment for this population. We keep in mind the unique needs of SIFE students  who cope not only with the language difference, but also concerns that may arise due to lack of formal educational  experiences and adjusting to a new culture. To address these needs, we focus on vocabulary, language patterns/structures and  acquainting them with the culture of the school environment. Our plan for SIFE students is based on strategically placing them       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           78      in classes where additional help from staff (teachers and/or paraprofessionals) speaking the student's home language is  available. In addition to standalone ENL sessions four periods a week (180 minutes) and four periods of integrated ENL  instruction (180 minutes), SIFE students would also be provided with additional instruction time during Title III After School,  Saturday Program, AIS and the ELL Summer Enrichment Program.    b. Newcomer    Newcomers (0-3 years) mostly have scored in the Entering/Emerging range and are pulled out four times a week to receive  intensive English instruction. We use several resources to supplement the TCRWP Units of Study.  Reading A-Z and Raz-Kids  from Learning A-Z are used to provide additional printable books for use in instruction on students’ instructional reading  levels.  Raz-Kids gives kids the ability to listen to the story as they read it.     Additionally, teachers utilize "Everyday English," which provides ELLs with basic vocabulary categorized in thematic units (i.e.  school, neighborhood, home, grocery store, etc.). ELLs learn phonics, conversational English, basics of sentence- structure/grammar and even begin to read (through the use of graphic comic strips related to the thematic units) and write  simple sentences in English.     Newcomers are also invited to attend an after school program focused on BICS, using materials such as leveled books from  Reading A-Z, online reading with Raz-Kids, and small group instruction focused on vocabulary and phrases with Genki English, a  software program best utilized with a projector or SMART Board.    c. Developing    Developing ELLs (4-6 years of service) are targeted in the Morning ELL Program and in the Title III STEM After School program.     d. Long Term    LTELLs (7+ years) are targeted with high-interest reading material.  This year, we have purchased many graphic novels to grab  the attention of reluctant readers.  We are also continuing to use Kindle Fire tablet versions of many grade-level novels, which  make definitions, translations, and audio narration available to students.  LTELL students are prioritized for the use of this  resource in order to increase engagement.    LTELLs are also targeted for the Title III STEM After School program.     e. Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Former ELLs continue to receive testing accommodations for two years after testing Proficient/Commanding. Additionally,  former ELLs are programmed in classes with current ELLs for at least two years after testing out and therefore receive the  support of the push-in ENL teacher.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?     There is an IEP Coach who monitors the IEPs of all students, including ELL-SWDs, to ensure that all students receive the  services they are entitled to.  The ENL teachers share a room with the Speech and OT/PT providers and are in regular dialogue  with each other about student progress.  These teachers, the AP in charge of ENL, the AP in charge of SpEd, and the school  programmer work together to ensure that all schedules are coordinated so that services do not overlap.    In grades K-8, the ELA curriculum is Teachers College Reading and Writing Project Units of Study.  Each classroom is equipped       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           79      with a large leveled library.  This ensures that all students will have access to engaging and appropriate text.  ELL classrooms  also have a Spanish library, and middle school ELL classrooms have a variety of graphic novels and books on lower reading  levels for students who need them; we are working to grow a Hi-Lo library as well.  As described in Item III-1, all students are  tested using F&P or TCRWP and are made aware of their reading level.    The TCRWP curriculum makes it possible for teachers to choose mentor texts that will be rigorous but still engaging and  appropriate for their students.  Teachers can select a text that they know is available in several other languages and can be  readily made available in Spanish.  Teachers may also choose a text that has a graphic novel or other version that can be  presented to students as another support.    ENL teachers work with ELA teachers to add Language Objectives into unit plans and to use the New Language Progressions to  differentiate instruction.  Visual supports such as PowerPoint, along with printed vocabulary words with pictures are  used.  Best practices from the SIOP model are integrated into instruction, which benefit all students, ELL and ELL-SWD alike.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?    To attain English proficiency in the least restrictive environment and achieve IEP goals, ELL-SWDs are often placed in ICT  classes. Additionally, the ESOL teacher pushes in to these classes during the ELA period to provide integrated ENL instruction.  Some ELL-SWDs that need further support receive additional AIS services from a special education teacher (typically the same  teacher that is providing ICT services on a particular grade).    If ELL-SWDs are either Entering or Emerging proficiency levels, they are pulled out an additional four periods (180 minutes) a  week to receive standalone ENL. Such an environment allows teachers to meet both the language and special education needs.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.    The following intervention programs are offered to ELLs specifically:  *After School ELL Newcomer Program (ELA, Grades 6-8, English/Spanish)  *After School ELL STEM Program (ELA, Grades 4-8, English/Spanish)  *Morning ELL Program (ELA, Grade 4, English/Spanish)    The following intervention and enrichment programs are offered to ELLs (as well as the general education population) in ELA  and Math:  *Regents: 8th Grade Integrated Algebra (offered to G&T class and select students, English)  *Expanded Learning Time (After-School Program (ELA/Math), English)  *Saturday Program (ELA/Math, English)  *AIS (ELA/Math, English)    Other programs (offered to students depending on their IEP, inclusive of ELLs):  *SETSS (ELA/Math, English)  *Speech (ELA, English)  *OT (English)  *PT (English/Spanish)  *Counseling/at-risk counseling (English/Spanish)    SEL and Extracurricular/Sports Programs (offered to all students):       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           80      *PBIS (English)  *Advisory (4R's Program, Morningside Center, English)  *Each One, Reach One (teacher-student mentoring program, English/Spanish)  *Peer Mediation and Conflict Resolution (English/Spanish)  *Lorraine Hansberry Eagles (boys basketball team, English)  *Lorraine Hansberry Lady Eagles (girls basketball team, English)  *Lorraine Hansberry Eaglettes (cheerleading team, English)  *214 Idol (singing competition, English)    Currently, there are no intervention/enrichment programs offered in Social Studies; however, many materials used in the  above mentioned programs provide informational texts rich with content from the sciences and social studies.    While ELLs (all subgroups, with a special focus on Entering, Expanding and all long-term ELLs), SPEDs, the school's bottom third  and gifted students are targeted populations in Expanded Learning Time and Saturday Academy. Nonetheless, all students are  welcome as space permits.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Last year, more than 10% of students went down a level.  This was of great concern; one next step we took this year was to  invite these students on grades 4-8 to the Title III STEM After School.  If this continues to be the case, we will develop a Title III  After School program to better meet the needs of these students.  Additionally, if there are many students in this category that  are Entering or Emerging, we may create Stand Alone ENL groups that target these students specifically.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A        11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are afforded access to all programs identified in #8.   In brief, we offer the following ELL-specific programs:    ELL Newcomer After School 6-8 -program for Newcomer students in grades 6-8.   ELL STEM After School 4-8 – program for Developing and LTELL students in grades 4-8  ELL Morning Program – program for select identified Expanding and Transitioning ELLs in grade 4        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.    *Projector and interactive whiteboard  *New classroom libraries with books at all levels  *Spanish-language materials for EnVision math  *5 iPad Pros designated for ELL use (Raz-Kids and other apps)  *15 Kindle Fires designated for ELL use (Raz-Kids, Kindle Books with Audio, and other apps)  *English/L1 dictionaries (as well as content area/specific dictionaries--i.e. science, math, social studies provided from the NYC  DOE website)  *Spanish literature/supplemental texts in class libraries  *Differentiated ELL teacher accommodations (i.e. graphic organizers, sentence frames, word banks, etc.)  * Learning A-Z / Raz-Kids  Spanish/English online texts with audio and EReaders     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           81           The school only offers Entering and Emerging ELLs a standalone ENL class and provides the push-in model when providing  integrated ENL services for all other ELL proficiency levels (Transitioning-Commanding).    The classroom library in all ELL classrooms includes Spanish-language books.    Middle school ELLs are offered Spanish as a Foreign Language.    Language Scaffolds.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    There are two ENL teachers, one for K-5 and one for 6-8.  Both teachers work to ensure that their students receive age and  grade appropriate instruction and are grouped appropriately for pull-out ENL services.  The middle school teacher makes sure  that the materials for all students, particularly the Entering students, appear age-appropriate.  The teachers both utilize the  Common Core State Standards and New Language Progressions to provide grade appropriate instruction to their students.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    The principals from both schools do monthly campus rounds to discuss and share best practices, which includes our ELLs.      16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   At the end of the school year, all incoming middle school students are invited to attend an orientation session to become  familiar with the expectations of middle school (i.e. meet teachers, grading policy/Honor Roll, CCLS, extracurricular  programs/activities).     A new Saturday Parent Academy begins in February to support parents of ELLs.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Spanish as a foreign language is offered to middle school students in grades 7 and 8.        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   NA      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Throughout the school year, teachers attend ELL-focused professional development offered by Fordham RBE-RN, DELLSS,  BFSC, and Teachers College.  During 2016-2017, ENL teachers and their co-teachers found the PD offered by Fordham RBE-RN       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           82         and at District 12 ELL Liaison meetings on Integrated ENL co-teaching to be particularly helpful.  These sessions contained  many strategies and supports we can implement in order to make the CCLS accessible to ELLs.  We plan to continue this work  going forward.  PD offered at a school level for staff is described in depth in Item 2.  Another professional development  support exists in the form of weekly ELL Team meetings (AP of ENL, ENL Teachers) where team members review work and  student data to plan next steps for instruction.  The ELL Team also works with Eva Garcia of RBE-RN once a month; Eva has  provided professional development for the team on helping the ELLs meet the CCLS.  Sessions are faciliated by  expereinced staff for noninstructional staff.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.    15 % and 50% of total professional development time will be provided to all teachers and ENL teachers respectively on  Mondays, during the 80-minute block of time immediately following the school day and on Chancellor's Conference Days for  Staff development. The sessions will be conducted by ENL teachers, the AP of ELLs, general education teachers that work with  ELLs, and ELA/Math coaches.  Last year, topics included “Language Acquisition vs. Learning Disability” and “Adapting Teachers  College Reading and Writing Project Units of Study to Meet the Needs of ELLs.” Records for such professional development are  kept  as part of our ENL binder, and also the school PD binder. They include both the agendas and attendance records.    The school secretaries and parent coordinator receive professional development through the Borough Field Support Center on  ELL issues.  School secretaries are trained on intake procedures.  The parent coordinator is also the Language Access  Coordinator and receives the LAC PD.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?     Our school provides annual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language development progress,  language proficiency assessment results and language development in all content areas. These meetings include, but are not  limited to the following activities:    Parent Engagement Sessions are conducted weekly and may be informal walk-ins, or scheduled appointments with the ENL  teacher/ENL Coordinator. These meetings may be conducted in person, over-the-phone or via email/Skedula--whichever is  best suited to the parents needs.  The ENL teacher takes the opportunity to meet with parents during these sessions.    Beginning in mid-October, ENL teachers identify a list of students that have not met with an ENL teacher during Parent  Engagement and begin to contact them to come in for meetings during the weekly parent engagement time.  The ENL teacher  creates an agenda and sign in sheet for each meeting.  These materials are retained in the ENL binder.    Information shared with the parent by the ENL teacher includes current student NYSESLAT level, growth information  (percentile and previous year’s score), F&P or TCRWP reading level, and most recent NYS ELA result (grades 3-8).  The ENL  teacher shares with the parent a goal sheet previously completed by the student and discusses ways that the student can work  to meet the goal at home and with the parent/family.    The ENL teachers make use of the DOE Language Line service and speakerphones to ensure that smooth communication with       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           83            parents is enabled.  One-to-one parent meeting conducted by a certified ENL provider.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.     Fun with Books is a monthly Parent Engagement event after school on Tuesdays.  Every grade selects a book to share with  parents.  Every effort is made to select books that are also available in Spanish to ensure greater parent access and  participation.    As part of our Title III Parent Engagement, ENL and bilingual licensed teachers organize trips to the local NYPL  branch.  Teachers and librarians talk to parents about the many resources the library has to offer, including books in other  languages.  Teachers and librarians also explain different ways to become involved in their child’s English language  development, even when the parent does not speak/read English.    International Night is an annual, potluck event. It encourages all parents/families and the school community to celebrate our  varied cultural backgrounds through food, traditional dress, music, dance and student performances.    Translation services are provided at all sessions/events (often by a bilingual parent volunteer).     Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, David Cintron, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.            2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           85                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PS 214 The Lorraine Hansberry                                                                              School DBN: 12X214  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      To assess language preference of the parent community for both written and oral communication we use the  Adult Preferred Language Report (RLAP), Home Language Identification Surveys, Language Preference Forms,  formal and informal interviews with the parents, and Student Registration Forms.  Among parents who speak Spanish at home, 90% of those who returned the language preference form indicated  Spanish as their preferred language for oral and written communication while less than10% chose both English  and Spanish. All other parents indicated their home language as their preferred language (either French or  Bengali) with the exception of Arabic speaking parents whose preference was consistently English.               2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           87     2.
