This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   UIM’s mission is, “I’m going to college…It’s never too early to start planning for the rest of my life!” With this motto in  mind we are intently focused on the Common Core Standards and affording our scholars top notch, rigorous  instruction in all classrooms.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    The Urban Institute of Mathematics, UIM, is a 6-8 middle school consisting of about 390 scholars located in the  Throggs Neck section of the Bronx. Our school was founded by the former principal and current assistant principal in  2007. Our STEAM-focused school is situated on the fourth floor of the IS 192 campus. Our campus consists of one  other middle school and one elementary school.      UIM is a member of the first cohort of the Middle School Quality Initiative (MSQI) putting us into the eighth year of  this work. MSQI focuses on literacy instruction at the middle school level. As such, our instructional focus is for all  scholars to graduate 8 th grade reading on grade level as measured by Degrees of Reading Power (DRP). Through our  work with MSQI we will have established a strategic reading period (SRP) for all scholars in our school. We adopted  the Core Ready reading and writing curriculum during the 2015-2016 academic year and will continue with this in the  2018-2019 year. Through this work period.tner with MS 101, another District 8 school, and LitLife consultants who  render PD to both our ELA staff as well as the administration. This year we will add Ready and IReady to increase our  time on text during our SRP period.   In an effort to improve our achievement scores in mathematics we partnered with the National Training Network  (NTN) in the 2015-2016 academic year and will continue this work in the upcoming school year. We have adopted a C  (concrete)-V (visual)-A (abstract) model of teaching math at UIM which is an inquiry-based approached to learning.  NTN, a company founded on constructivist ideals in mathematics, will help us drive this work with the help of  consultants and their KEMS and KEAS curriculum. Our NTN consultant works with our math department on best  practices in teaching mathematics as well as curriculum mapping, pacing and the high-frequency standards. Like in  ELA, we partner with MS 101 in the area of math as well. Additionally, we have a math team at UIM that aim to  highlight scholars who have a liking for mathematics. This year we will add Math Ready and Math I Ready to increase  our time on task during our Strategic Math period      Beyond the core subjects of ELA, mathematics, science and social studies, we aim to continue our partnerships and  grants from the 2017-2018 academic year. Some partnerships include New York Road Runners Club, CHAMPS sports,  Solar One, Bio Bus, Makeosity, Thurghood Marshall Mock Trial, MSQI debate league, Woodlawn Leadership Legacy  Program, ., LeAp, New Victory Theatre, Lincoln Center and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, to name a few. Through  these partnerships we are able to bring both in-school and after school opportunities to our scholars at UIM. After  school we offer such things as Portfolio Art, musical theater, improv comedy, tutoring, Mock Trial, Lego Robotics,  Chess, Car Modeling, SHSAT prep courses and much more. We offer a zero period to our scholars for more time on  task. During the zero period, called Early Morning Start, we offer science, math and ELA tutoring across all three  grades.   UIM was selected to be a part of the Chancellor’s Community School initiative that revolves around developing  Community Schools and improving attendance. We are partnered with the Mott Hall Community School, the other  middle school on our campus, in this work. Through this work we have a renewed focus on attendance and the  interventions we employ. We have partnered with East Side House Settlement (CBO) around this work and currently  employ a Community School Director, two student advisers, a parent resource specialist and a social worker to focus  on community building, mental health, and the social-emotional welfare of our school community. Through this work  we track attendance daily, have advisoers that target selected scholars, and hold weekly Student Success Summit  meetings to discuss data and scholar progress. This continues to be an element on the Framework for Great Schools  (Strong Family-Community Ties) that we need to place focus on. Through our Community Schools work, we aim to  bring resources from the community into the school building by welcoming, encouraging and developing partnerships  with families, businesses and community-based organizations. An additional element of this work will be to enhance  our after school programming with the help of East Side House and SONYC. In an effort to encourage scholars to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      remain in the school building longer and to target the “whole child” by offering programs that fall outside of the CCLS- aligned curriculum. Our SONYC program is STEAM focused and is in line with our school mantra, "Full STEAM Ahead".      In terms of academics, we are a school in Good Standing with NYS. In 2018, the following were our ELA proficiency  percentages: 52% of our 6 th graders (up from 40% the previous year) , 45% of our 7 th graders (down from 51% the  previous year) and 60% of our 8 th graders (down from 62% the previous year). In mathematics the numbers are as  follows for 6 th -8 th grade respectively: 21 % (down from 26% the previous year), 25% (down from 38% the previous  year), and 34% (up from 21% the previous year). We continually focus on the academic growth of our scholars in  addition to proficiency levels. In all Core Classes we use baseline exams to gauge our entry point and end line exams  to determine progress.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   About 20% of our population consists of scholars with special needs. In order to better serve this population we need  to look at our explicit instruction, differentiation, and targeted AIS programs. This targetted instruction happens  during the Strategic Math, Reading and Science Periods specific to each individual scholars needs and groups are  updated every marking cycle based on most recent data points. Data shows that we are inconsistent with this  population and need to do a better and more measurable job with this cohort of scholars. In 2017-2018 we used a  departmentalized method of instruction with our scholars in our special education cohort and we will continue with  this in 2018-2019. We aim to place scholars in the least restrictive environment and have added three ICT classes to  our school to allow for this. In addition to ICT we offer self-contained classes (12:1 and 12:1:1), SETSS, and related  services. About 7% of our scholars are ELLs. We offer both push-in and pull-out services to these scholars via a  certified ESL teacher.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Data shows that we need to strengthen our work in the area of mathematics (Rigorous Instruction). We will also  continue to improve our work in the area of ELA (Rigorous Instruction). Our strategic period lends itself to aid in  improving the academic achievement for all scholars in our school and is directly aimed at our instructional focus. As  we enter our sixth year in having this strategic period we aim to strengthen this work and enhance our Tier I  instruction while adding Ready and I ready to increase time specific time on targeted small group instruction. We also  aim to integrate Making Thinking Visible (Ritchhart,Church and Morrison) strategies into all classrooms (Supportive  Environment). In order to make these shifts in pedagogy we also need to focus on our work in the area of  Collaborative Teachers. By continuing with Professional Learning Communities and offering solid professional  development opportunities we allow teachers to hone their skills and improve their practice. Finally, we continue to  work towards improving parent participation in our middle school (Strong Family-Community Ties). While we certainly  have trust and a strong home-school connection we aim to increase the amount of parent involvement and the  number of parent participants at our school events. We aim to create sub-committees to enhance our family- community ties.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 08X371   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   350   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     Our core courses follow curriculum that is rooted in the Common Core standards. All teachers are required to craft a  year-long curriculum map during the summer prior to the academic year. From there teachers write unit maps for  each of the six units in our academic year. In addition to core courses in ELA, mathematics, science and social studies,  scholars are enrolled in a homogeneously leveled (based on Degrees of Reading Power scores (DRP) strategic reading  period (SRP). Scholars engage in Strategic reading, math and science periods and will receive instruction specific to  their needs based on most recent assessments. We will use the Google docs to track the growth of the targetted  students with the goal of returning them to grade level proficiency.      Beyond the core subjects, all 6 graders receive physical education and visual art, all 7 th graders receive Spanish,  theater, health and physical education and all 8 th graders receive an Art elective, Spanish, theatre and physical  education.       On our most recent QR (2015-2016) we received Well-Developed in three areas (1.1, 3.4 and 4.2) and two proficients  (1.2 and 2.2). We need to continue to hone our work in the area of assessments and pedagogy. Additionally, as per  ADVANCE, MOTP ratings show that more than half of our teachers continue to struggle with Danielson’s Domain #3.  More improvement must be noted in competencies 3b, 3c and 3d.    We adopted the Core Ready curriculum in reading and writing in the 2015-2016 school year and will continue with  this in the upcoming year. We will continue our work with our LitLife consultant to continue to improve our ELA  instruction and ensure that we use the Reader's and Writer's Workshop with fidelity. We will continue to use the  Teacher's College Writing Pathways rubrics and checklists to assess writing in four distinct genres of study: narrative,  poetry, argumentative and informational.      NYS test data shows that continued improvement with math is needed. Our proficiency scores need to be improved  and as such we will continue our partnerships with NTN in the area of mathematics. Teachers, via surveys, state that  they need more assistance with the inquiry or constructivist approach to teaching mathematics. They also need  assistance with pacing.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13         Our most recent School Quality Snapshot (2017-2018) shows that 52% of students met State Standards on the State  ELA exam.

This report also showed that  only 76% of our students have an overall attendance percentage over 90%.   Most recent School Learning Environment Survey (NYC School Survey) reflects that 80% feel safe.   Most recent QR rated us Well Developed in indicator 3.4 which is consistent with our previous QR report as well.      We added the Astor Mental Health clinic at the end of the 2015-2016 academic year and need to continue to bolster  this for the upcoming academic year. Our Learning Environment survey shows that only 46% of our scholars say that  teachers notice when students are upset or having emotional difficulty. Via our mental health clinic we need to find a  better way to identify scholars and provide adequate services. We need to do a better job of targeting at-risk needs  around counseling and conflict resolution as deficits in this area may lead to our lower attendance numbers.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   As a school we pride ourselves on the professional development that has been rendered on the Danielson Framework  since its adoption several years ago. We staff four Peer Collaborative Teachers (PCT) who render PD and serve as  models or exemplars to the staff. As part of the Teacher's Center i3 mentoring pilot we also have a tremendous  amount of support for our newer teachers.       Each year we start off the year with a Danielson Self-Evaluation survey so that teachers can self-assess their areas of  strength and weakness. From there we craft differentiated professional development plans to support improvement  in targeted areas. These plans are reviewed at the mid-year point and new surveys are rendered. After each  observation cycle the administration desegregates the data to see how we are progressing and to highlight trends and  patterns. Observations are always done in a timely manner with feedback being rendered within about 48 hours. We  utilize outside consultants/coaches to aid teachers with discipline-specific professional development all in relation to  the Danielson Framework as well as a coach from the DOE's Inter-School Office.      Another positive for us is our use of Intervisitations as a from of moving pedagogy in our school. We use data to group  teachers into triads where they work together to improve their instruction in relation to one particular aspect of  Danielson. They use intervisitation tools to serve as critical friends to each other.       We need to continue to improve our teaching in the area of lesson planning (1E). This can only be done through  Collaborative work and the use of Professional Learning Communities (PLC). We need more schedule PLC time for  teachers to meet with their peers as well as with their consultants.

Our PLCs meet at least once per week on Tuesdays after school as per the  new UFT contract. PLCs engage in inquiry-based work around the CCSS. Additionally, as per the UFT contract we have  80 minutes of mandated PD every Monday. Our Professional Development team aids in crafting our professional  development plan for the year. Professional development is content-specific on Mondays which aids in ensuring that  our teachers stay relevant and current in their field. We utilize outside consultants, such as those from NTN, LitLife, I  Ready coach, NYHS, etc. Our Peer Collaborative Teachers also render PD to the staff.      In order to ensure that our PD is differentiated we based PD assignments on Danielson ADVANCE data, student  assessment data and Needs Assessment Surveys.

Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     We have both school-wide and classroom based assessments. Our assessment plan details both. School wide  assessments consist of the DRP, School Net baseline assessments and periodic assessments. Teachers aid in selecting  these at the end of every academic year for the following year. In ELA we utilize the Writing Pathways book to  administer baseline and end line writing assessments and assess scholar work with Writing Pathways rubrics. We  teach four distinct units of study in writing. In terms of math, our consultant from NTN aids teachers in crafting unit  assessments. We utilize the KEAS and KEMS NTN curriculum and the corresponding assessments. Teachers in all other  subjects craft their own classroom assessments as per their curriculum map and essential questions.   ● Assessment Committee that votes and/or offers input to the section or process of assessments   ● Use of School Net to render standard specific assessments   ● Use of Engage NY    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      ● Teacher teams review the effectiveness of school-wide and/or common assessments    ● Writing Pathways Checklists and rubrics   Different assessment strategies are compared so as to determine the most effective strategies and how they can be  best modified and/or adapted for school-wide use    ● Use of standardized rubrics across classes.   ● Teacher teams also help create, align, and modify school grading policies    ● PD always includes a reflection piece so that all voices are heard in terms of the assessment practices and the  needed PD        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)           1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.

In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   .Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. 08X371, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children.

The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

Community  Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and  family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in  Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health &  Wellness.    Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s)   How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student  academic outcomes?   First and foremost, our CS strategy focuses on attendance. If scholars are not in school then they are not learning. We  strategically target scholars in Tier 2 and 3 according to the heat map and have crafted a plan of action to get them in  school. Once in school our attendance mentors do daily check-ins with their targeted scholars. This has a direct  impact on academics as scholars are now in school and now can focus on academic outcomes.      Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to  be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.    By June 2019, we will see a 2% increase in attendance as evidenced by attendance reports.   By 2019, our 7th graders will have exposure to college by visiting at least 4 college campuses and by receiving the  College Access curriculum.   By 2019, our 7th graders will have greater insight into the NYC high school articulation process. We will conduct high  school visits, a high school fair, and will hold several workshops on this process.   By 2019 we will increase our STEAM offerings to scholars in accordance with our instructional focus.         Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Community School Annual Goal(s):  How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family  Engagement, and Health & Wellness--support your academic goals for students?  By tracking daily attendance our CS work will directly improve attendance and have a great impact on academic  achievement. We will be engaging families in this process by holding workshops on attendance, college and high  school articulation. Our parent intervention specialist will be meeting with families one-on-one to establish individual  goals.         Part 2 – Community School Partnerships Core Services Action Plan   Part 2a. Identify the Community-based Organization (CBO) partnerships that you will develop in ELT, Attendance  Supports, Family Engagement, and Health & Wellness, their target student population(s), and scope of the services  provided.

Community Schools are expected to partner with a community-based partner organization (CBO) and  together with members of the School Leadership Team, hire a Community School Director. The Director will  lead implementation of the asset and needs assessment process, and other critically important coordinating  activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work.  Community Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and  services, as determined by the asset and needs assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time  (ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the  right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly  coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day.  Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to  strengthen this initiative.  Community Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and  families feel welcome, actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of  their schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community  School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this family engagement  strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work.  Community School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director,  select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual  students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use.  Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work.   We have a CS director in place who oversees this work. In consultation with our SLT we make decisions to drive this  work forward. Our director is on site daily and meets with the administration on a weekly basis. During these weekly  check-ins we determine how we are working to achieve our goals. These meetings help us to seamlessly coordinate  services. Through our CS work we primarily focus on STEAM initiatives that need enhancement beyond the school day  as well as high school and college articulation.       Through our daily attendance check-ins, to weekly group meetings we are working to track attendance, set goals and  monitor progress. We hold weekly attendance meetings and discuss scholars via an attendance protocol where we  use the data from the New Visions heat map/data sorter.      Realize that we are not a renewal school so there is no mandated ELT involved.         Part 4 – Community School Partnerships Oversight   Part 4a. Key Staff and Partners  1.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  We use the DRP to assess reading levels.  This assessment is administered three times per year and this data aids us in  grouping scholars and in providing literacy interventions to our scholars in addition to ESL.  Data shows that our ELL scholars  are reading below grade level.  Thirteen out of our 24 ELLs are "at risk" as per the DRP.      Additionally we look at ELA CCLS test data as compared to NYSESLAT data and find trends between the two.  We use this  data when crafting our instruction and pay particular attention to the four modalities tested on the NYSESLAT: speaking,  reading, writing and listening.  We tie our ENL instruction to our ELA instruction.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52         Our ENL teacher sits on a PLC with the ELA teachers.  This PLC is spearheaded by the principal.  Working as a team we analyze  this data and use it to differentiate our instruction.  Additionally our ENL teacher has time set aside in his schedule to plan with  his ELA counterparts.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Although our ELL sample size is too small to have an AYP for ENLs, we analyze internal data and surface the strengths and  weaknesses of our program.  In addition to the DRP, classroom assessment tools, such as class work, quizes, exams, etc.,  are  used to gauge the progress of our ENL scholars.  Our ENL teacher uses this data to inform the individual instruction that he  renders during his ENL program.  Additionally, we give NYSESLAT practice assessments and utilize that data to inform our  instruction and next steps.  Ultimately we evaulate our program by anaylyzing scholars growth on the NYSESLAT and CCLS  assessments.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Again, the use of professional learning communities aids us in analyzing data and planning out interventions for our  scholars.  We use a feedback loop to assess and refine our work during meetings.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   All scholars, including ELLs, participate in our RtI model.  Daily all scholars are scheduled for an RtI 53-minute literacy class  based on data.  Our ELL scholars fall into a range of RtI courses such as Wilson Reading System, Achieve 3000, Wilson Just  Words and Stari.  These are fluid groupings which allow scholars to move between groups depending on data.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   All of our ELLs are reading below grade level as per the DRP.  We have 11 performing in the first (lowest) quartile and four  performing in the second quartile.      Additionally we look at ELA CCLS test data as compared to NYSESLAT data and find trends between the two.  We use this  data when crafting our instruction and pay particular attention to the four modalities tested on the NYSESLAT: speaking,  reading, writing and listening.  We tie our ENL instruction to our ELA instruction.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Information is disseminated through PLCs.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Based on a child's ENL status services are rendered.  We follow all requirements as per CR Part 154.2.  We offer stand- alone ENL instruction as a pull-out program for scholars who need this service.  Our ESL teacher also pushes into  classes as part of our integrated teaching model.  All ELLs are grouped together on each grade level so that services  can be more easily rendered to the group.      b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         Paste response to questions here:      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Paste response to questions here:      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              We adhere to all time requirements and program models.  Our ESL certified ENL teacher renders all stand-alone services  when applicable and scholars who require this service have their ENL classes programmed in STARS.  When an integrated  model is needed for our emerging, transitioning, expanding and commanding scholars we use a collaborative model (push  in).  Our ELA certified teacher co-teaches with our ESL certified teacher during our integrated model.  STARS programming  reflects the appropriate number of minutes given each individuals status.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      All classes are delivered in English and all curriculum is CCLS-aligned.  All classes are differentiated and integrate UDL  strategies.  Core Ready is used for ELA instruction and KEMS (NTN) is used for math instruction.  NYC scope and sequence  documents are utilized.  Native language support is rendered via Internet sources and native language dictionaries.  ENL  teacher offers supports by providing scaffolding and differentiation.    Front-loading and anticipatory sets are used to help  scholars preview material.  Computer-based programs such as Dual-Lingo is used for newcomers.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?         Paste response to question here:        5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Our ESL teacher meets with these various groups together as well as separately at times and always adheres to the mandated  amount of instructional minutes required for each group.  He uses data to track progress and arrange groupings.  Classroom  teachers are made aware of this data as well and utilize it to plan daily instruction.  The ESL teacher differentiates the  instruction for these scholars.  The use of Internet translation tools aids in this process.  ELLs who have been in the country  longer and who are long-term ELLs or former ELLs receive small group guided instruction regularly.  All ELL scholars receive  testing modifications as per the regulations.   Our ESL teacher plans collaboratively with the core teachers to ensure that this  occurs.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Currently we have zero ELL-SWDs.     Differentiated instruction, UDL, RTI, and level-based resources, including technology are used.  Our ESL teacher and our IEP  teacher work in conjunction to ensure that these scholars receive all required services as per their IEP.  In addition to the CCLS- aligned curriculum materials used in class (Core Ready and KEMS), these scholars receive Tier III ELA intervention daily for 50- minutes.  These intervention programs focus on English language acquisition.  We also use iPads to provide support.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      All scholars are parallel programmed to allow for movement between programs and groupings.   We realize that special  education is not a placement.  Our scholars are integrated with their non-SWD peers.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  We offer targeted intervention programs in ELA daily for 50-minutes.  In math we offer early morning and afternoon tutoring  that affords scholars with an additional hour of mathematics instruction prior to the start of the school day or following the  regular school day.  Targeted intervention in science and social studies occurs during the push-in and pull out ESL period.  All  programs are offered in English.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      No new programs will be added but we will continue to make improvements in our pedagogy.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A       11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs participate in all regular programs and activities.  After school we offer extracurricular programs such as sports (football,  soccer, track, cheerleading, basketball, and baseball), drama (school musical and play), talent shows, student government,  chess, car modeling, robotics, debate, honor society. etc.  All tutoring programs are offered during and before school.  In  school ELA interventions are offered to all scholars.  All communication is rendered in a family's preferred language.     We also  applied for and received an Arts-based ENL/SPED grant this year with allowed us to partner with LeAp to provide a special Arts- based program for our ELLS.  Our ELLs were engaged in creating graphic novels and in making claymation iMovies via our Mac  computers.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Each scholar has a laptop to use during the school day.  Materials are translated into native languages when necessary.  Native  language dictionaries are supplied to all ELL scholars for assistance with school work.  Internet sites are used to translate  curricular materials into native languages.   Scholars also use iPads and headphones particularly when using Dual-Lingo.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   All families are given the Home Language Survey upon enrollment.  Materials are translated into native languages when  necessary.  ESL teacher aids with teaching strategies.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Our ENL teacher ensures compliance with all ENL related matters.  He meets with our Pupil Personnel Committee to  disseminate information.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Although we are co-located, we have a stand-alone ENL program in our school.  We do not share an ENL provider.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Welcome packet and family handbook, orientation by ESL teacher and an advisor assigned to each scholar for three  years.  Parent meetings are hosted by our ESL teacher.  Incoming 6th graders participate in an orientation event.        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55         Spanish     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  As a school we have a year-long professional development plan for all teachers.  As part of this plan we understand  that 15%  of all total PD hours must focus on ELL-specific PD for all teachers.  Additionally we understand that 50% of the total hours for  ENL/ESL teachers must focus on ELL-specific PD.  We will meet all of these requirements.  All teachers participate in professional development sessions on Monday afternoons (80 minutes) and convene teacher team  meetings on Tuesdays (70 minutes).  During this time teachers participate in inquiry teams, CCLS-aligned curricular PDs (Core  Ready, KEMS), Danielson Framework PDs, etc.  ELL and special education strategies are incorporated into all PD  opportunities.  We work with the ESL point-person at our Bronx Borough Field Support Office to enhance our training of  teachers regarding their ELL learners.  Our ENL teacher participated in the Bronx-based PLC this year for ESL  teachers.  Additionally our ENL/ESL teacher will be allowed to attend DOE centrally offered PD on a regular basis.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  All scholars, including ELLs, receive support as they transition to middle school from elementary school.  Each scholar is  assigned an advisor who stays with them for three years.  This person aids with the transition as this person serves as their  advocate at school.  Via advisory scholars are transitioned into middle school life in a slow and smooth manner.  Assistance is  rendered with organization and scheduling.  The guidance counsleor leads our Pupil Personnel Committee (PPC) where we  meet to discuss scholars with needs such as our ELL and special education population.  Supports or interventions are added as  needed.    All traning received from the BFSC or Central is turn-keyed by our ESL teacher to the staff including teachers, guidance  counselor and parent coordinator.  ELL training and strategies are incorporated into all PDs and trainings as we concentrate on  specific cohorts of scholars.  A welcome meeting is held for all new families by our ESL teacher.       All teachers participate in professional development sessions on Monday afternoons (80 minutes) and convene teacher team  meetings on Tuesdays (70 minutes).  During this time teachers participate in inquiry teams, CCLS-aligned curricular PDs (Core  Ready, CMP3), Danielson Framework PDs, etc.  ELL and special education strategies are incorporated into all PD  opportunities.  We will work with the ESL point-person at our Bronx Borough Field Support Office to enhance our training of  teachers regarding their ELL learners.  Our ENL teacher participates in the Bronx-based PLC which affords him the opportunity  to meet with other ESL teachers on a monthly-basis.  Additionally our ENL/ESL teacher will be allowed to attend DOE centrally  offered PD on a regular basis.  We keep a copy of our professional development plan on site along with all agendas, signature  sheets and support materials.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56            Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Parents partner with the school via PTA, SLT, Title 1 Committee, CBO initiatives and LAP initiatives.  We hold many initiatives  that foster parental involvement throughout the year.  We partner with the Phipps Beacon CBO as well as East Side House  Settlement to provide after school, night, and weekend programs.  Translation services are provided in Spanish regularly and  via translation services in other languages as needed or requested.  Upon entry into the school parents receive all welcome  information such as the Home Language Survey, Parent Survey and Program Selection Forms.  Parent Coordinator takes the  lead on bringing parents into the school via various workshops such as mommy and me literacy, book clubs, technology usage,  Pupil Path, etc     2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  Our Super Tuesday workshops are open to all parents, including parents of ELLs.  We offer translation services at all meetings  as necessary.  Our PC often renders involvement activities for parents and offers translation.             Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Jennifer Joynt, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Urban Institute of Mathematics                                                                              School DBN: 08X371  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Over 90% of our families identify English as their Native language. Of those that did not identify English, a majority  of our non-English speaking parents have a home language of Spanish. As such, we have several key staff  members who speak Spanish and provide written and oral translations/interpretations. Key staff members who  are bilingual include the secretary, office staff (school aides), parent coordinator, school counselor and our Vice  Principal. We use DOE provided materials and services to meet the needs of other families including translation  services. Outside of Spanish we have two families who speaks Chinese, one family who speaks Greek, with a  preferred language of English and one arabic speaking family. We do conduct regular surveys and offer those  surveys in all necessary languages.   We utilize data and various methodologies to assess language preferences of the parent community for both  written and oral communication. We analyze Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey(HLIS), ATS   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      reports, Student Emergency Contact cards, and any surveys conducted by your school. From there we create a  report that we update regularly with the languages that parents speak, by class and grade.           2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.

We review this during our staff orientation each year on the first day of school in September. We also provide all staff  members with hard and soft copies of this regulation.          Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      All DOE materials will be posted, made available and will be sent home. Our Parent Coordinator will also keep copies  of this material in her office.           Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       We issue parent surveys three times per year. This information is disaggregated by our ENL teacher and our LAC. We  make revisions and improvements to our work as necessary.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63
