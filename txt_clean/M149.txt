The motivation driving this work is our commitment to providing every child with a school that  meets their academic and social-emotional needs. Closely accompanying this imperative is our belief that every school  can be renewed and foster a community based culture of learning. The job of the district is to use our position to  provide the systemic vision, strategies, and resources to facilitate school renewal through a collaborative effort including  all stakeholders.     The core values held as essential for the success of the School Renewal Program:     A “learning stance” must be held by all community members (district leaders, school leaders, school staff,   community-based partners, students and families). The work should be approached with humility and integrity.  We must all be willing learners.     A “theory of action” must guide the work to ensure clarity and coherence.    Authentic teams that collaborate in the spirit of trust, within and across the various levels of the school   community, are prerequisites for successful school renewal     Schools will be places of robust engagement, anchored in positive youth development, ensuring that the school   environment is welcoming and empowering for students, families and community members.     Strong professional development/learning is a fundamental part of our work.    The school renewal implementation must be simultaneously dynamic and responsive as well as sustained over   the three year period of renewal.     The organizing Theory of Action that guides the School Renewal Program strategy:   By using the Six Elements of the Framework for Great schools as our improvement structure, we seek to align  instructional coaching and leadership development with structural supports in order to build staff capacity.   Using schools  instructional foci, school leaders  and staff will implement changes  in curriculum,  instruction,  school  culture  and  structures  so  that  there  are  sustainable  improvements  in  student  outcomes  and  school  culture.     The arc of the School Renewal Program strategy:  In order to attain high levels of achievement for all students in Renewal  schools we must build capacity to increase  student achievement through the adoption of new attitudes and behaviors, research based strategies that improve  teacher practice, coupled with the use of clear data driven supports for building students’ skills in the content areas and  increasing student engagement. We are particularly prioritizing reading and writing across the curricula.  The use of  student learning data will drive instruction through strong teacher teams; onsite, job embedded professional learning  and problem solving, and accountability at all levels of the system:  central, district and school - for results. Renewal  schools are provided with intensive training, leadership and pedagogical coaching, and structural supports, monitoring  of implementation and ongoing feedback and revisions as needed. Further, each Renewal school will become a  Community School and strategically partner with community based organizations (CBO) to integrate social services and  expanded learning time into the fabric of the school to help them better serve the needs of students.  These schools will  stand as centers of opportunities where families can get the supports they need to make sure students come to school  ready and able to learn.    Structure of the Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP)   The Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP) will serve as the organizing and overarching document for  each Renewal school and will be directly aligned and developed around the elements of the Framework for Great  Schools, New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, and Strong Schools,  Strong Communities, including the following:     Demonstrable Improvement Benchmarks: Demonstrable improvement benchmarks located in the 2018-19   RSCEP, in the Data and Accountability Snapshot page.  Receivership benchmarks have been closely aligned with   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          5      the Renewal benchmarks so that schools will have one coherent set of improvement benchmarks to meet.  All  Receivership Benchmarks are a subset of Renewal Benchmarks. While the targets for these overlapping  benchmarks are not always identical, the Receivership Benchmark targets are always equal to or lower that the  Renewal Benchmarks targets. That means that any school that meets its Renewal Benchmarks targets have by  definition also met its Receivership Benchmarks targets. For additional information on Receivership  demonstrable improvement benchmarks go here.      Establishing an overarching summative vision aligned with elements of the Framework for Great Schools and   documenting key areas of celebration and renewal through analysis of assessments and by envisioning what the  desired outcome for each school will be at the end of the School Renewal process.      Setting interim assessment benchmarks that create the path for improvement by focusing on desired outcomes   and goals. In this way, the plan will be mapped to the overarching summative vision. In addition to the five  discrete goals formed around the elements of the Framework for Great Schools, each school will create an  action plan.     Transformation into a community school in order to increase student and family access to physical and mental   health services and other social-emotional supports made available in or near the school.     Expanded learning opportunities for all students, including additional instruction provided during afterschool      and/or summer programming provided in collaboration with community partners.  Intensive professional development for all staff to ensure effective implementation of curriculum and  instruction aligned to the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and to support staff in effectively responding  to the differentiated academic and social-emotional needs of all students.    Additional, focused strategies to increase parent and family engagement.      Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Information on the Framework for Great Schools and the DTSDE   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and RSCEP Development   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          6      The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive  Educational Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for  continuous improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing  review and analysis of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement  activities and strategies that improve outcomes for students.       Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.       The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          7     how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:   1.  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity  2.  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions  3.  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support  4.  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions  5.  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and  6.  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement    NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the RSCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the RSCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.     Next Steps for RSCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists in every Renewal school   and meets all the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the American Institute of Research (AIR) needs   assessment, the school’s updated NYSED accountability status and most current quantitative and qualitative  data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          8        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.       Step 4: Create a summative vision for the elements of the Framework for Great Schools.     Step 5: Revisit your school’s current goals, and strategically create new goals informed by the needs   assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART – Specific,  Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you monitor  progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you have identified, and will let your school  community know when you have reached your goal.       Step 6: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 7: Update your school’s AIS section. Title I schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement   Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 8: Complete the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) and the Community School sections.     Step 9: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether strategies and activities outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust practices along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          9      Section 3: Community Engagement Team and School Leadership Team (SLT) Signature Page       Directions: All SLT members are expected to sign this page to confirm their participation in the development of this  Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP).

Summarize the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) opportunities that have been offered to your students this year.      The mission of Sojourner Truth School, 03M149 is to prepare students for lifelong learning and responsible, caring,  productive citizenship. In partnership with parents, families, and school community members, administrators,  teachers, and students will collaborate to create a supportive atmosphere where all students are pushed to achieve  their personal best. It is the vision of the Sojourner Truth School to provide students with a rigorous, high-level  instructional program, which will prepare students for future success through a wide-range of course offerings,  enrichment programs, guidance support services, and other school experiences to gain the learning competencies  needed to go on to higher education. Sojourner Truth School community assists students in achieving their potential  by becoming critical thinkers, active problem-solvers, inquisitive readers, diligent researchers and effective writers.   Sojourner Truth School utilizes the workshop model in core content areas. The workshop model enables students to  experience brief direct instruction from teachers and then receive varied levels of scaffolded support based on  individual student needs. Small groups and 1-on-1 check-ins enable teachers to monitor student understanding and  plan instructional next steps for specific students and whole class.    In school year 2017-2018, 03M149 had 230 students enrolled in elementary and middle school (Pre-K through 8th  grade). 52% of students are male, 48% are female. Of these students, 60% are Black (African American or of African  descent), 30% are Hispanic, 2% are American Indian or Alaskan Native, 2% are Asian, and 6% are Caucasian. Sojourner  Truth School serves a high poverty community. Average attendance during 2017-2018 school year was 93.18%. 17%  of the student population consists of English Language Learners with home languages of Spanish, French, Arabic,  Wolof, and Bangladeshi. Students range from new speakers to proficient (entering through commanding). 03M149  does not currently have an SIFE students enrolled. Sojourner Truth School has a full-time ENL teacher on staff.    25% of the students are classified as having special needs. Of those 25%, 39% of students are in self-contained special  education classes. The remaining 61% of students receiving special education services receive SETSS. Sojourner Truth  School has 5 full-time special education staff members, 4 classroom teachers and 1 speech teacher.    Family and community engagement are essential components to Sojourner Truth School as it is a Community School.  Monthly family workshops are hosted by the Community School Director and Parent Coordinator. 03M149's  partnership with NY Foundling provides families with counseling and workshops. Parents are invited to engage in their  child's academic life during performance, open houses, conferences, and monthly classroom events.    Of the Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools, 03M149 is making progress in the area of "Collaborative  Teachers”, providing teachers with opportunities to participate in teacher team meetings. "Strong Family-Community  Ties" is an area where the school continues to focus its attention. Throughout the year, opportunities for parent  involvement have been provided (i.e. workshops on homework help, literacy, behavior management, common core  curriculum, and proper nutrition). The school continues to focus on strengthening family – community ties by seeking  additional support in family outreach and engagement.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          12      Harlem Children's Zone (HCZ) is the primary CBO that has provided support to the school, both during and after the  school day. HCZ has been instrumental in expanding the range and depth of academic support provided to students.  They have incorporated the use of the iReady program into after school, pairing its use with instruction during the  school day. More one-to-one and small group support is provided for students by HCZ staff members who are more  highly trained than in previous years. HCZ has, also, provided the after-school program for the majority of students at  PS/MS 149. In addition to homework help and test prep, students have been provided with a multitude of enrichment  activities and initiatives. The HCZ Healthy Harlem program has provided instruction on proper nutrition, daily fitness,  and a dance program for elementary and middle school students. In addition, other enrichment activities have  included arts & crafts, chess, gymnastics, tennis, basketball, and drama (gr. K-8).   Harlem Lacrosse (HLL) is another school-based CBO, which works directly with middle school students throughout the  school day and the calendar year. HLL provides year-round tutoring, academic guidance and behavioral intervention.  During the school year, students attend mandatory lunch-time study halls designed to help them complete school  assignments, gain a deeper understanding of their coursework and improve their behavior. HLL supplements study  halls with individual tutoring sessions, push-in teaching and behavioral intervention for struggling students. Over the  summer, HLL hosts summer camps that include afternoon academic sessions, high school transition counseling, and  Boarding School Boot Camp. HLL's lacrosse programs are designed to keep students engaged and active throughout  the year. Students attend practices three times per week during the fall and spring seasons. Practices emphasize the  importance of teamwork and aim to build student confidence. On weekends, HLL schedules lacrosse clinics,  scrimmages and games with partner organizations. During HLL's weekend events, HLL players interact with children  from different communities and meet mentors who have used lacrosse as a gateway to educational and professional  opportunities. In addition to hosting a summer day camp in July, HLL secures scholarships to sleep-away summer  camps for students who have shown the most academic and behavioral progress over the course of the year. HLL's  mentoring events build leadership skills and help students set new goals for their future. During weekend clinics,  games and trips, HLL connects children to communities of volunteers, student-athletes and educators. Mentoring  activities occurring after lacrosse clinics or games facilitate cooperation between HLL students and their peers from  towns outside of Harlem. During college trips, student-athletes and campus leaders lead HLL players during tours,  informational sessions and workshops that help students understand how to overcome obstacles to obtaining a  college education. Past college trips have included visits to Yale, Princeton, Brown, Duke, Siena College, the University  of Virginia, Howard University and the University of Pennsylvania. HLL provides a unique service to students  interested in pursuing admission to the most prestigious institutions in the country: free preparatory school and  college admissions counseling. Students who enroll in the program receive free academic tutoring, SSAT preparation,  essay counseling, advising and school visits throughout the application process.   Expanded Learning Time at 03M149 provides students with 5 additional hours of academic support each week.  Harlem Children’s Zone staff provide additional support working with students in small groups during instruction to  review and reinforce class learning. HLL staff provide additional academic tutoring. The ELT session is divided into  three components that allow students to receive targeted academic support and tutoring in the four core content  areas-mathematics, English language arts, science, and social studies. Sojourner Truth School believes that completing  homework assignments dramatically increases the power of classroom learning experiences. Research supports this  belief: on standardized tests, students who regularly complete homework outperformed non-completers by 35%.  Therefore, students will focus on completing homework assignments given during the instructional school day with  the assistance of teaching staff in a structured and supportive learning environment. The positive benefits of ELT will  include opportunities for students to reinforce what was taught in class, prepare for the next class meeting, learn how  to take and manage responsibility for one’s own learning, and evaluate their understanding of the work presented.   For the 2018-2019 school year, ELT will continue to incorporate the Math Mastery program for grades K-8 targeting  foundational computational math skills aligned with CCLS. In grades K-5 students will engage in a teacher led read  aloud to build fluency. ELT will also provide students with dedicated instructional time using the iReady program.  Academic enrichments offered during ELT include coding, Lego Robotics, and Writopia. Other enrichment activities  that are offered at Sojourner Truth School include GoSkate programs, Media arts programs, National Dance Institute  classes, and Young People's Choir.       2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          13           2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          14         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 03M149   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05,06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   235   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

School's strengths include:     The principal has introduced a set of high academic expectations to the staff aligned to the Danielson   Framework for Teaching.     Teacher teams and school leadership established a culture for learning that communicates high expectations to   students.      Curriculum   The school leaders and faculty ensure that curricula are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards and the  instructional shifts. Curricula and tasks emphasize rigorous habits. Curriculum components include: Bridges in  Mathematics Curriculum, K-8 Expeditionary Learning Curriculum, Math Solutions Math Consultant, weekly grade band  or content area meetings, departmentalized grades 4 and grades 5; 3-8 science and social studies content specialists,  mathematics small class size reduction in grades 6-8, K-8 instructional pacing calendars, dedicated instructional time to  social studies and science in elementary school.      2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          17      Teacher Development   Professional learning opportunities support faculty members in meeting the high expectations set so that teachers are  accountable for student progress and students are prepared for the next level. An instructional leadership team  composed of school administrators and teacher leaders to structure and lead activities to transform teaching and  learning in the school. This includes robust observation and feedback on teacher practice, analysis of student work,  professional development, curriculum and lesson planning, and refining student engagement practices.   Instructional Coaches- A Literacy Coach will support teachers of ELA and SS in curriculum planning, assessment  development, and student progress monitoring. An IEP teacher will support teachers of Special Education and reading  intervention development and implementation.   Math Solutions- The Math Solutions Consultant supported teachers during a content development session which  focused on drawing visual representations of student thinking using box diagramming (part/whole understanding) and  revising through the CRA model of instruction; classroom coaching sessions focused on both the teacher and consultant  doing a content related classroom routine together or consultant model (school decision) to engage students into  mathematical reasoning and precise mathematical talk. Each teacher will complete a self-monitoring professional  growth implementation rubric with personal next steps for growth.       Instructional Practices   Purposeful instructional decisions have built instructional coherence to benefit all students, and tasks emphasize more  rigorous habits and higher order skills across grades and subjects.   In order to deepen student learning and increase rigor in curricula and tasks, teachers focus on a progression of skills  from basic to advanced levels, such as synthesizing two points of view, or for fourth and fifth grade students, to consider  the different ways characters react to events.    The implementation of vertical teacher teams fostered greater collaboration. Teachers met with the Instructional  Coaches in partnerships to develop planning skills; learn to modify the curriculum to meet student needs; and improve  upon instructional practices.   All students received weekly progress reports that provided them with ongoing access to their grades and data to  inform their goal setting. This level of information also supports students with preparing for student-led conferences  with their teacher and family member, during which they followed a script that included explanations for highest and  lowest grades, how to improve study habits, and goals for the upcoming trimester. As part of this process, teachers  were provided with guidance to support their role in monitoring success and resolving academic difficulties. For the  meeting, parents were provided with a checklist to serve as a guide and they received a folder that includes academic  alerts, flyers, progress reports, and the school calendar.    The principal has created an instructional calendar to serve as a tool for planning that makes transparent what is to be  taught from grade to grade and across content areas. Teachers use this calendar to communicate with each other and to  plan across grades and departments. Teachers also design curricula maps aligned to the calendar, and place emphasis  on where students are and what they learned previously.    The majority of teachers engage in structured professional collaborations that promote the school’s focus on  instructional coherence. Teacher teams analyze assessment data and student work for students they share. The  principal has made key decisions to ensure that all teacher teams meet regularly to look at student work using the  Teachers College writing rubric and to review assessment data. The principal provides additional periods for common  planning time and has paired middle school and elementary teachers for team-teaching partnerships in order to  promote instructional coherence. The purpose of these pairings is to offer extended professional learning and   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          18      collaboration, and to provide elementary teachers with access to upper grade content to strengthen instructional  cohesion.    Several support structures are in place to inform students of their progress toward reading and writing goals as a result  of all teachers tracking their progress. For example, students meet with their teachers to discuss their running records’  accomplishments. This supports teachers with creating students groups based on reading level.   Additionally, teachers have created a student-friendly grade book tracker that indicates how students are progressing in  reading workshop, writing workshop, math, science, and social studies.      According to the 2015-2016 Quality Review, superintendent recommendations, feedback from the Office of School  Renewal, and school self-assessment, 03M149 needs the following to sustain students' academic progress:   Literacy Instructional Coach, IEP Teacher, TeacherEase Online Gradebook.      Literacy Instructional Coach: Teachers will be supported in whole class, direct and explicit instruction via strategy  demonstrations. Teachers will be supported with creating classroom environments conducive to student support and  collaboration.   IEP Teacher/Special Education Support: The IEP Teacher will provide support to teachers of Special Education and  reading intervention development in order to enhance teacher practice and student outcomes.    TeacherEase Online Gradebook: All students receive weekly progress reports that provide them with ongoing access to  their grades and data to inform their goal setting. This level of information also supports students with preparing for  student-led conferences with their teacher and family member. As part of this process, teachers are provided with  guidance to support their role in monitoring success and resolving academic difficulties.      · VERTICAL TEACHER TEAMS: 03M149 is a small school with 1-2 teachers per grade. Lower school (PreK-5) teachers  teach across content and upper school (6- 8) are content specific. To foster greater teacher collaboration centered on  student work, outcomes, and instructional practices, 03M149 requires stronger and purposeful teacher vertical teams.  Teams require common planning time and teaming structures.   · COORDINATED ASSESSMENT PRACTICES: 03M149 requires a well-coordinated set of formative and summative  assessments to accurately identify students’ performance levels and set benchmarks for progress throughout the year.  In addition, the school need a transparent, shared, and accessible electronic data monitoring system that allows  teachers and administrators to closely monitor student performance and share ongoing progress with students and  their families.   · CURRICULUM IMPLEMENTATION: Vertical grade and interdisciplinary teams require deeper understanding of grade  level rigor and learning progressions within each grade and from grade to grade so as to appropriately implement  curriculum and continue to develop a coherent, school-wide instructional focus.   For Literacy, 03M149 has chosen Expeditionary Learning for grades K-8. For Math, Bridges in Mathematics (K-5) and  New York State Engage Curriculum Units (6-8). Each content area requires curriculum maps with clear objectives,  learning targets, lessons, and assessments outlined throughout the year so that teachers have a clearer understanding  of what needs to be taught; when; and how to appropriately assess it.      2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          19       Part 2 – Summative Vision for Rigorous Instruction   What is your school’s instructional focus? What is your vision for promoting the instructional focus consistently across  classrooms?    CURRICULA, SCAFFOLDS, PROGRAMS, INSTRUCTIONAL SHIFTS, : The school’s vision for Renewal includes the  implementation of an instructional framework addressing the academic and socio-emotional needs of students through  grade-level Common Core aligned-curriculum (Expeditionary Learning, Bridges to Mathematics, and teacher adapted  materials from EngageNY Math curriculum); small group and supplementary instruction through Expanded Learning  Time; and behavioral supports through individual, small group and family counseling. Teachers will fully adopt the  NYCDOE Social Studies Scope and Sequence; ELA (Expeditionary Learning), Math (K – 5 Bridges to Mathematics; 6 – 8  EngageNY), and NYC DOE Science Scope and Sequence.   In alignment with the Common Core instructional shifts, the teaching of reading and writing across all content areas will  be paramount, with key focus areas being academic vocabulary, questioning & discussion, and writing across curricula.  Students will build knowledge through a balance of fifty percent literary and fifty percent informational texts in the  lower grades (PreK-5), and gradually shift to content rich and non-fiction informational texts. In math and science, the  focus will be on engaging students in learning experiences requiring fluency and application of math scientific concepts.  Classroom evidence of such will include the implementation of the workshop model, usage and maintenance of  classroom libraries, math centers, and science kits and a science.   Based on student performance outcomes, M149 will continue to prioritize mathematics and English Language Arts  instruction while ensuring students have access to grade level instruction with SS and science.    CONSISTENCY: To ensure instructional coherence between core instructional time and the expanded day, instructional  specialists will support cross-functional teacher teams across grade bands and content areas. Together with teachers,  he/she will collaboratively map curriculum, lessons, and student activities. To ensure coherence in discipline and  academic behavior, 03M149 and CBO partners will collaboratively develop a set of expectations and supports for  responding to students’ socio-emotional needs.          What is your vision for the implementation of CCLS-aligned curricula that meets the needs of your diverse learners,  personally, academically, and culturally?   The school’s vision for Renewal includes the implementation of an instructional framework addressing the academic  and socio-emotional needs of students through grade-level Common Core aligned-curriculum (Expeditionary Learning,  Bridges in Mathematics, and teacher adapted materials from EngageNY Math curriculum); small group and  supplementary instruction through Expanded Learning Time; and behavioral supports through individual, small group  and family counseling.   Teachers will fully adopt the NYCDOE Passport to Social Studies and integrate field trips to enhance instructional  content and provide students with learning experiences at historical settings that foster academically focused shared  social experience to enhance interest and engagement. Economically disadvantaged students will be given the  opportunity to gain exposure to historical important sites and access to learning experiences that may not otherwise be  available to them.    ELA teachers will launch Year 1 of the Expeditionary Learning curriculum in order to foster a thematic and novel based  approach to ELA instruction that is aligned more closely to the Book Club guided reading model utilized by 03M149.  Teachers of mathematics in Grades K-5 will begin Year 2 of the Bridges in Mathematics curriculum. Mathematics  teachers of grades 6 – 8 will continue to use teacher created curriculum informed by EngageNY mathematics resources.  For students identified as below grade level additional small group instruction will be provided by classroom teachers  and additional support during the Expanded Learning Time. To ensure multiple entry points for all students, including   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          20      SWDs and ELLs, mandated service and support personnel (i.e ESL, SETTS, AIS teachers, paraprofessionals, counselors,  tutors, etc.) will collaborate with content areas teachers to identify and implement academic supports.   Book Clubs will be implemented in grades 3-8. Clubs will meet 3 times a week for a full instructional period. Groups will  be organized into gender specific student groups within reading level bands across grade levels. Book clubs will provide  at-risk students will small group instruction focused on their specific readying needs with the goal of acceleration  reading fluency, comprehension while fostering a love of reading. As well as enable accelerated readers to engage with  higher level texts and discussions.    During Expanded Learning Time students will engage in coordinated academic and extra-curricular learning blocks and  will receive instruction from 03M149 teachers and HCZ CBO staff and HLL CBO staff. All students will participate in the  tiered Math Mastery program. Depending on assessment outcomes, students in K-8 will participate in small group  academic tutoring sessions utilizing structured literacy and STEM programs, technology, or extracurriculars to  supplement core learning. Students in grades K-5 will continue to use iReady during ELT.         What is your vision for diverse program offerings that allow students to develop skills, habits, and behaviors to be  career and college ready? How are instructional shifts embedded in this vision?  This year, PS 149 will offer students (including ELLs, SWDs, students below grade level) a number of support services to  develop skills, habits, behaviors including AIS, targeted small group instruction in mathematics, iReady for math and  reading support, an advisory program that helps students with goal setting and personal progress monitoring, Harlem  Children's Zone and Harlem Lacross college visits; Rising Leaders program that brings in professionals to mentor  students.         What do you envision the delivery of instruction to look like so that all students are set up for success?   PEDAGOGICAL PRACTICE, CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT:    School leaders will develop, implement and evaluate curricula to ensure rigor and alignment to CCLS. The school leader  will support instructional coaches and teachers in using effective instructional strategies to meet students diverse  learning needs.    With the support of school based Literacy Coach and instructional specialists, teachers will implement the workshop  model of instruction comprising a mini-lesson, independent work time, and share. During mini-lessons, teachers will be  supported in provide whole class, direct and explicit instruction via strategy demonstrations, reading and writing for key  concepts and specific purposes, questioning and discussion, hands-on activities, and explanations as to how to apply the  lesson and complete independent work. During independent work time, students will work alone, in pairs, or small  groups as teachers facilitate, intervene, support and conference with students.   All teachers of Grades 3-8 will participate in Book Clubs, creating a cohesive guided reading program throughout all  classrooms. Book Clubs will include unit plans for each book read, daily lesson plans, end of unit projects, and reading  level assessments.    Teachers will receive support with creating classroom environments conducive to student support and collaboration,  featuring standardize key elements across classrooms – clearly defined, organized and partitioned learning spaces (such  as math centers, word walls, group areas, reading areas, libraries, student work, etc. ), flow of the day, objectives, and  learning targets that clearly summarize the day’s lessons for students and classroom observers, visual supports to guide  student practice during independent work time and anchor charts to memorialize and support instruction after the  lesson has been taught, classroom libraries organized by level and interest and actively utilized by students, student  work areas that demonstrate student processes, outcomes, expectations of completed work, grading criteria (i.e.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          21      rubrics) and feedback, and behavioral supports that help students to self-monitor (i.e. code of conduct; behavior rubric,  etc.).         How do you envision teachers using multiple entry points to ensure the success of every child?  MULTIPLE ENTRY POINTS: For students identified as below grade level additional small group instruction will be  provided by classroom teachers and additional support during the Expanded Learning Time. To ensure multiple entry  points for all students, including SWDs and ELLs, mandated service and support personnel (i.e ESL, SETTS, AIS teachers,  paraprofessionals, counselors, tutors, etc.) will collaborate with content areas teachers to identify and implement  academic supports. K-5 teachers will implement the math curriculum, Bridges in Mathematics. Teachers at the middle  school level will implement Year TWO of Algebra for All in keeping the Chancellor's vision. These new curriculum will  provide access to mathematics that increases student engagement and ensures readiness for high school and college  mathematics. There will be an increased focus on problem solving and discourse. Literacy Coach will facilitate the  implementation of Book Clubs to further develop teacher pedagogue in the teaching of reading to struggling students  and increase opportunities for students to received differentiated instruction regardless of grade level.    EXPANDED LEARNING TIME: During Expanded Learning Time students will engage in coordinated academic and extra- curricular learning blocks and will receive instruction from 03M149 teachers and HCZ CBO staff and HLL CBO staff.  Depending on assessment outcomes, students in K-8 will participate in small group tutoring sessions utilizing structured  literacy and STEM programs, technology, and the arts to supplement core learning. To start, students will continue to  engage with iReady, Math Mastery, and homework recovery.         What is your vision for the use of a comprehensive assessment strategy (diagnostic, formative, benchmark, and  summative) to drive curricular, instructional, and organizational decisions that impact student outcomes?  ASSESSMENT: The school will determine every student’s baseline math and literacy level in the beginning of the school  year through the use of iReady assessments and reading level assessments and will administer assessments throughout  the year to measure student progress and gauge the impact of instructional strategies and interventions.   Professional activities for teacher teams during common planning time will include:   · Foster common assessment practices and grading policies   · Create common rubrics and criteria checklists   · Give constructive feedback to students on assignments and plan follow-up activities   Teachers will also design and utilize a variety of classroom based assessments to measure comprehension and the use  of specific strategies, including:   · Conferencing and noting of reading behaviors   · Written summaries, syntheses of ideas, reflections, reading logs and journals; and   · Presentations; "think/pair/share" activities and other demonstrations of accountable talk.

HLL  supported 03M149 middle school community in establishing structures to create a safe environment conducive to   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          31      learning. Structures included academic support during lunch time study hall and academic and behavior expectations  students must meet to earn eligibility to participate in games and practices.    Young People's Choir (YPC) provided students in grades 3-8 with weekly choir instruction in variety of musical genres.  Participation in this program supported students in the development of self-discipline and positive self esteem while  learning to read sheet music and follow the direction of musical director.    Alvin Ailey Dance Kids delivered dance instruction to students in grades 1- grade 8. Teacher artists provided rigorous  dance instruction weekly while integrating music history into lessons. Participation in the program served as motivation  for students were improve their attendance and reduce negative behavior to earn the opportunity to participate in the  weekly program.       The Leadership Program is a CBO youth development and professional learning organization working with staff once  per month to build professional relationship and a supportive collegial culture      The Rising Leaders Mentor Program is a New York City area program which recruits and deploys Ivy league alumni of  color to New York City schools to serve as peer mentors and college and career coaching to students in grade 5-8. Four ,  full day Saturday workshops are provided throughout the course of the year      PRIORITY NEEDS   For the 2018-2019 school year, the priority needs for the school include:   COHESIVE SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL CURRICULUM: In grades K-8 students will participate in age appropriate social-emotional  curriculum.

Part 2 – Summative Vision for Supportive Environment   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          32      What is your vision for a supportive school environment? How will you in partnership with each CBO and families  enact your vision?  03M149 is committed to creating and maintaining a learning environment in which all students may achieve their  greatest potential. The school leadership, environment, and instructional practices will demonstrate the belief that all  students can be successfully prepared to meet the academic expectations for elementary school, middle school, and  beyond. Through an effective relationship with and between Community Based Organization (CBO) partners (Harlem  Children’s Zone, Harlem Lacrosse, and other services), 03M149 offers students additional opportunities to develop,  learn and grow by providing a well-coordinated set of academic, social, emotional, and recreational opportunities during  the day and after school.    The school based Parent Coordinator surveys families and creates a parent support workshop action plan to address the  interests, needs, and concerns of our families based on survey outcomes.    The school guidance counselor, psychologist, social worker, School Based Support Team (SBST), and CBO partners  collaborate to provide one-to-one and small group support to students. Counseling, emotional support, and guidance of  students begin with an assessment and understanding of students’ academic and socio-emotional needs through review  of performance data, IEPs, staff observations and anecdotal, and regular conferring with families. Staff, families, and  CBO partners, then collaborate to build a responsive system to identify students at-risk, implement preventative  services, provide interventions and conduct interim and post assessment of student development. The school guidance  counselor, psychologist, and social worker will collaboratively analyze social histories and behavioral/psychological  assessments to measure student growth and the impact of their services. Teacher and CBO partners will use student  self-assessments, surveys, staff anecdotal, academic performance data and feedback from parents to measure student  development. This information will be then be utilized to modify and maintain responsive socio-emotional services for  students.    03M149’s attendance rate averaged 93% in 2017-2018 school year, an improvement from 91% in 2016-2017. 03M149's  attendance will continue to improve through the strategic engagement of families, appropriate outreach to chronic  absentees, and refinement of instruction and socio-emotional support to meet students’ needs.          Who are your CBO partners? How will each CBO sustain and support the social-emotional and academic growth of  your students?

CBO partners (Harlem Children’s Zone, Harlem Lacrosse) will support and collaborate with families, teachers,  administrators, and socioemotional support staff to match at-risk students to support services such as mentoring,  tutoring, and physical and mental health services. To sustain and support the social and emotional health of students,  these partners will conduct a student needs assessment, help to establish academic and socioemotional goals for each  student, monitor their progress towards their goals, and share this information with students and their families. CBO  partners will also coordinate services and opportunities for families to encourage participation in school governance and  academic planning for their children.    Enrichment activities, including chess, horticulture, soccer, and inline skating. Family engagement includes family  activities, such as game nights and karaoke, to engage parents and help them get more involved in the education   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          33      process. During the summer, HCZ runs a free all-day summer camp to keep kids safe, engaged, and on track. Above all,  HCZ supports school wide coherence to support and guide students on their academic journey.   Harlem Lacrosse (HLL) will support students in the development of discipline, work ethic and leadership skills. HLL will  utilize the team concept as a means of inspiring institutional pride and cohesion among students. For students who  have demonstrated unruly behavior in the classroom, lacrosse helps to instill discipline and respect. The presence of a  full-time lacrosse coach, academic tutor and mentor reinforces the notion that lessons learned in lacrosse are applicable  throughout the school day. HLL is school-based, which allows our staff to work directly with students throughout the  school day and the calendar year. HLL provides year-round tutoring, academic guidance and behavioral intervention.  During the school year, students attend mandatory lunch-time study halls designed to help them complete school  assignments, gain a deeper understanding of their coursework and improve their behavior. HLL supplements study halls  with individual tutoring sessions, push-in teaching and behavioral intervention for struggling students. Over the  summer, HLL hosts summer camps that include afternoon academic sessions, High School Transition Counseling and  Boarding School Boot Camp. HLL's lacrosse programs are designed to keep students engaged and active throughout the  year. Students attend practices three times per week during the fall and spring seasons. Practices emphasize the  importance of teamwork and aim to build student confidence. On weekends, HLL schedules lacrosse clinics, scrimmages  and games with partner organizations. During HLL's weekend events, HLL players interact with children from different  communities and meet mentors who have used lacrosse as a gateway to educational and professional opportunities. In  addition to hosting a summer day camp in July, HLL secures scholarships to sleep-away summer camps for students who  have shown the most academic and behavioral progress over the course of the year.    PS 149 promotes students’ social-emotional skills through the support and strengthening of students’ academic skills,  voice, choice, and leadership in the classroom. Student voice will be encouraged and supported through the use of  academic questioning and discussion techniques by teachers and HCZ during instructional and recreational activities.  Classrooms environments will be organized into flexible and cooperative learning configurations to support student  collaboration so that all students, including SWDs and ELLs, can learn and participate. To encourage student leadership,  CBO partners and teachers will adopt a framework to foster respectful interactions with and among students, ensuring  that students find the classroom a safe place to take intellectual risks. Students themselves will make a substantive  contribution by assisting with classroom procedures and school activities that support the learning of their classmates.

Sojourner Truth School works to foster a supportive environment for all students by establishing a school culture that  ensures all students feel safe and academically challenged. Teachers at Sojourner Truth work collaboratively to plan  across grade levels in vertical teacher teams. Sojourner Truth has departmentalized grades 4-8, allowing for  collaboration and cohesion across content areas.       During the 2017-2018 school year, teachers led professional development sessions around content and strategies in  order to promote effective classroom instruction across the school. Teachers are committed to the success of all  students in the school and work in teacher teams to score assessments, provide feedback, and align instructional  practice.          In the 2018-2019 school year, Sojourner Truth School will continue to implement the following collaborative protocols:       VERTICAL GRADE & INTERDISCIPLINARY TEACHER TEAMS: PS 149 is a small school with 1-2 teachers per grade.

Along with  teaming, there is a need for common planning time, wherein teachers’ and students’ schedules are strategically  programmed to enable all teachers and administrators across grades and content areas to meet and plan regularly.   ASSESSMENT SCORING: PS 149 collaboratively scores formative reading assessments and summative content  assessments. This practice enables for teachers norm their instructional practice and notice trends across classes and  grade levels.       According to data from Advance observations, teachers at Sojourner Truth continue to need support in questioning and  discussion techniques (Danielson Framework 3B). During the 2018-2019 school year, school leadership will facilitate  additional professional learning around these strategies, as well as identify teacher leaders that have shown mastery in  this area to model and provide feedback to colleagues.        Part 2 – Summative Vision for Collaborative Teachers   What is your vision for collaborative teaching?     To foster greater teacher collaboration centered on student work, outcomes, and instructional practices, PS 149 will  form cross-functional vertical teacher teams across grade levels and interdisciplinary content areas. Along with teaming,  there will be common planning time to enable teachers across grades and content areas to meet regularly and plan  units and lessons.   The school’s vision for Renewal includes the implementation of a three tier instructional framework addressing the  academic and socio-emotional needs of students through grade-level Common Core aligned-curriculum (Tier 1); small  group and supplementary instruction (Tier 2); and individualized intervention or enrichment for higher achieving  students. (Tier 3). Within Tier 1, teachers will utilize the Expeditionary Learning and Math (K – 5 Bridges in Mathematics;  6 – 8 EngageNY Mathematics curricula, and identify entry points for students. In line with the Common Core  instructional shifts, the teaching of reading and writing across all content areas will be paramount, with key focus areas  being Academic Vocabulary; Questioning & Discussion; and Writing across the Curriculum. Students will build  knowledge through a 50/50 balance of literary and informational texts in the lower grades (PreK-5); and gradually shift  to an increase in non-fiction informational texts in grades 6-8. Students will engage in learning experiences requiring  fluency, application, and deep understanding of mathematical and scientific concepts. Classroom evidence of such will  include the implementation of the Workshop Model; usage and maintenance of classroom libraries, math centers, and  science kits; the use of discussion across content areas to strengthen comprehension and accountable talk and student  writing. Teachers will use the Extended Learning Time to individualize support for students in need of intervention or  enrichment. Content area teachers, mandated service and support personnel (i.e. counselors, tutors, ESL, SETTS, AIS  teachers, paraprofessionals, etc. will collaborate with to identify and implement academic supports.    PS 149 will implement the Positive Behavior Support System in conjunction with the CBO partner to ensure every  student is safe in their class. The school will also identify a set of common behavioral and academic expectations and  student engagement practices valued by the school community and applied to all students and staff in all school settings  (including ELT and after-school). A consistent program throughout K-8 classrooms will enable teachers to collaborate  around behavior management strategies.

To foster greater teacher collaboration  centered on student work, outcomes, and instructional practices, PS 149 will form cross-functional vertical teacher  teams across grade levels and interdisciplinary content areas. The school staff (teachers, administrators, guidance  counselor, psychologist, social worker, School Based Support Team, etc.) will collaborate with CBO partners (HCZ,  Harlem Lacrosse and Leadership, Positive Learning Collaborative) to provide one-to-one and small group support to  students, and professional development for teachers.          How do you envision collaboration within teacher teams to improve teacher practices and student learning?   VERTICAL GRADE & INTERDISCIPLINARY TEACHER TEAMS: To foster greater teacher collaboration centered on student  work, outcomes, and instructional practices, PS 149 requires the formation of stronger and purposeful teacher vertical  teams across grade levels and interdisciplinary content areas. Along with teaming, there is a need for common planning  time, wherein teachers’ and students’ schedules are strategically programmed to enable all teachers and administrators  across grades and content areas to meet and plan regularly. Teacher Teams will prioritize developing strategies for  instructional practices around Questioning and Discussion (Danielsen 3B).    Teachers will engage in peer visitations in order to provide colleagues with actionable feedback and support. Teachers  of common grades or contents will communicate in order to foster a collaborative environment and continuity between  classrooms.          How do you envision collaboration across teacher teams to improve teacher practices and student learning?   ANALYSIS OF STUDENT PERFORMANCE: From September to June, school leaders will work with teacher teams (vertical  grade level/content) or individual teachers to analyze students' achievement data (gradebook, student work, running  records, state tests, other assessments) and make instructional adjustments as necessary. To identify multiple entry  points for all students, including SWDs and ELLs and higher performing students, teachers will participate in a year-long  examination of the curriculum to identify instructional gaps, needed scaffolds and enrichment.

What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide,   Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review?   Sojourner Truth School has created a comprehensive professional learning plan that offers support in areas of the  Danielson Framework, curriculum development, leadership development, and social and emotional health. Teachers  and staff are able to select which professional learning session they wish to attend based on their specific needs, this  allows for differentiation in offerings. Sessions enable staff to engage collaboratively in school wide practices to foster  continuity and consistency. Professional learning sessions are led by a variety of school staff including teachers, coaches,  assistant principal, and principal, allowing for an array of voices and expertise to be shared among the whole school  community.    School leadership meets weekly to discuss school data streams including, teacher observations, student attendance,  iReady usage, and student class grades. This reflective practice enables school leadership to modify professional learning  offerings and coaching focuses based on the individual needs of specific teachers. School leadership also meets to  discuss specific student needs regarding special education services and social emotional health.    03M149 works collaboratively with HCZ and other partnerships to provide teachers and staff with access to school  based support. NY Foundling provides social and emotional health services to students and families, as well as providing  support to teachers regarding classroom strategies.    In the 2018-2019 school year, Sojourner Truth School must continue to develop the school's Professional Learning  Committee to ensure additional teacher voice is taken into account when developing professional learning offerings and  coaching focuses. Sojourner Truth School will continue to offer teacher choice when offering professional learning.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          45      Leadership will collect additional feedback from professional learning sessions to ensure objectives and teacher needs  are being met. Based on the most recent Quality Review, Sojourner Truth School will continue to develop practices  around collaborative teachers and effective school leadership.         Part 2 – Summative Vision for Effective School Leadership   What is your vision for effective school leadership at your school?   Upon completion of the Renewal Program, the school will have established and articulated a clear instructional focus  rooted in the academic achievement of students despite perceived barriers. School leadership will collaborate with  instructional and student support staff, families, and CBO partners to design a vision and mission to be shared through  frequent and transparent communications, structured implementation, follow-up and solicited input for refinement  from all stakeholders. Under direction of the principal, CBO partners and community educators will participate in the  needs assessment of the school and participate in common planning time and collaborative work sessions. Staff,  families, and CBO partners will then together build a responsive system to identify students at-risk, implement  preventative services, provide interventions and enrichments, conduct interim and post assessment of student  development, and communicate with families. The model will be for CBO partners and community educators to provide  one-to-one and small group support to students.           On which aspects of your own leadership do you plan to focus for the upcoming school year?  Sojourner Truth School will utilize and refine the implementation of evidence-based systems to professionally develop  teachers and school leaders – specifically the Danielson Framework for Teaching and the Principal Practice Observation  Tool used for the Principal Performance Review. 03M149 will work to develop a more consistent professional learning  feedback system in order to hone the focus and delivery of professional learning.          What is your vision for ensuring that everyone in your schools has a normed and shared understanding of the school’s  vision, mission, and instructional focus?   School leaders will norm and establish a shared understanding of expectations for teacher practice, develop a consistent  and structured mode of feedback, and create a schedule for frequent classroom observations and debrief. Teacher  observation data will be charted and frequently analyzed to determine areas of focus for professional development and  additional coaching. To ensure that the school and individuals continue to improve, administrators, teachers, and CBO  instructional partners will set and document initial goals in September, teach toward those goals, and identify areas of  need for professional development. To achieve instructional coherence, the principal will design strategic and frequent  collaborations between staff and educational consultants, coaches, and other professional development providers  according to individual students, teachers, and school-wide needs.            What is your vision for developing differentiated leadership throughout your school? How will you utilize teacher  leaders to build broad capacity within your school?   Differentiated leadership will include school administration and teachers leaders who monitor the progress of teacher  pedagogy in core subject areas.         How will the leader foster collaborative school governance processes, and ensure full family participation together  with other stakeholders?  2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          46      In collaboration with CBO partners (HCZ), guidance counselors, and administrators will engage parents on a regular  basis to ensure parent awareness of student development, academic, and socio-emotional needs.

All students will complete  math fluency work (Math Mastery) and engage in iReady instruction. Sojourner Truth School believes that completing  homework assignments dramatically increases the power of classroom learning experiences. Research supports this  belief: on standardized tests, students who regularly complete homework outperformed non-completer by 35%.  Therefore, students will focus on completing homework assignments given during the instructional school day with  the assistance of teaching staff in a structured and supportive learning environment. The positive benefits of ELT will  include opportunities for students to reinforce what was taught in class, prepare for the next class meeting, learn how  to take and manage responsibility for one’s own learning, and evaluate their understanding of the work presented.   Harlem Children Zone will partner with CBOs to offer a range of activities designed to improve student academic  outcomes and strengthen student engagement as follows:   - Writopia   - Robofun   - Sing & Learn   - Go Sport Skate   - Super Soccer Stars   - Young People's Choir   - National Dance Institute   - Christadora Manice Environmental Science Camp      Harlem Children’s Zone (HCZ)- HCZ staff will partner with 03M149 classroom teachers and content specialists to  provide academic and instructional support during the ELT program.

Harlem Lacrosse and Leadership (HLL) - HLL coaches will provide targeted tutoring, academic guidance and mentoring  during ELT to HLL student athletes. HLL will supplement ELT with individual tutoring sessions, push-in teaching and  behavioral intervention for struggling students. HLL's mentoring events will build leadership skills and help students  set new goals for their future, and connect students to communities of volunteers, student-athletes and educators.  Students who enroll in the program receive academic tutoring, SSAT preparation, essay counseling, advising and  school visits throughout the application process.   Professional Development- School-based ELT teachers as well as CBO educators will participate in professional  development corresponding to the program component they will implement and specifically related to instructional  practices designed to increase student achievement. Integrated professional development sessions will take during  professional learning time scheduled for PD Mondays. Monthly professional learning sessions will be offered to CBO  partners to ensure alignment with school academic initiatives and instructional focus. Weekly check-in and planning  meetings will be scheduled with HCZ and HLL program directors and coordinators.   Family Communication- Family outreach will be coordinated through collaboration between the 03M149 Parent  Coordinator and the NYCCLSI Community School Coordinator who will serve as the primary liaisons between families,  school community, and CBOs. Each CBO partner will be provided with a bulletin board near the main entrance to  ensure community members have easy access to current program information during arrival and dismissal.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          71        Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/RSCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          72      Section 11: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)        (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. [PS 149 Sojourner Truth] , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A  of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   [PS 149 Sojourner Truth] will support parents and families of Title I students by:   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          73      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  The level of literacy skill of a student is determined by the TCRWP running records.  The analysis of the data is used to inform  school wide intervention for ELLs.  Students are grouped for intervention during small group and strategy lessons based on  their proficiency in literal and inferential re-telling, comprehension, accuracy, fluency are grouped for intervention during  small group and strategy lessons.      Additional data points include: i-Ready diagnostic assessments, i-Ready lesson performance, writing samples, and conferring  notes.         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          85         Assessments occur periodically throughout the school year. Their implementation is staggered, providing varied points of data  to create coherent small groups and enhance instruction.  Instructional planning for ELLs is coupled with classroom instruction.  ENL teachers partner with classroom teachers to ensure that students are receiving in class support as well as integrated out  of class instruction.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  03M149 utilizes NYC performance tasks, i-Ready assessments, NYSESLAT assessments throughout the school year to monitor  student proficiency.  Additional data is gathered through unit assessments and TCRWP running records.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Summative assessment data is gathered at the end of instructional units and trimesters.  Based on student achievement in  classroom assessments and ELL assessments, small group assignments are adjusted.  Assessment standards are coded in order  to track student progress in meeting ELL benchmarks.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   03M149 uses data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention framework by identifying students who  are not showing sufficient progress on the skills and competencies measured by the NYSESLAT and ELL Periodic Assessments,  writing samples, and quizzes in order to provide additional support.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   03M149 uses the NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, ELA, and Math NY State tests.  Immediate data is collected through i-Ready  assessments and lessons to understand where ELLs are on the continuum of language development.  Core content unit exam  grades, midterms, finals, and semester grades are also analyzed to measure student proficiency which allow teachers to  provide appropriate scaffolds according to their proficiency level.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The ENL teacher participates in a weekly planning meeting with an instructional coach to review student data and academic  progress and also an instructional mentor to support ELL planning.  i-Ready data is available online through the i-Ready  website.  Core content grades and performance can be accessed through the school's online grade book.           Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   03M149 implements a combination of standalone ENL instruction and integrated ENL instruction.  Students at the  Beginner/Entering and Low Intermediate/Emerging levels receive standalone and integrated instruction in block  heterogeneous small groups. Students at the Intermediate/Transitioning, Advanced/Expanding, and  Proficient/Commanding levels receive integrated ENL instruction in ELA and content area classes.     2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          86         b.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Explicit ENL instructional minutes are delivered to students in our program model as per CR Park 154.  Following the mandated  minutes chart, PS 149 insures that all Entering and Emerging  students receive 360 minutes and all Transitioning, Expanding,  and Proficient students receive 180 minutes weekly utilizing the integrated model as per CR Part 154.           3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   03M149 utilizes a combination of integrated and standalone ENL instruction, thus instructors are able to tailor content and  pace to meet the individual needs of each student.  Phonics instruction is incorporated into all standalone instructional  sessions for students at the Entering and Emerging levels, as well as incorporated into the integrated instruction occurring in  the general classroom.  Students at the Transitioning, Expanding, and Proficient levels are given enhanced vocabulary  development and writing practice.  Technology is utilized during content area instruction in order to aid in student  comprehension of the topic.  ENL teachers working with students at the Advanced level or higher receive in class support  during content area instruction in order to enhance their understanding.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   Students are assessed in their home language for the Math NY State Test through the use of translators. Teachers deliver  culturally and linguistically appropriate lessons to meet the needs of ELLs.  Teachers aim to provide integrate language in  content instruction through language focused scaffolds. Teachers utilize instructional materials that are age and grade  appropriate and collaborate with school based support personnel.  Teachers articulate specific content and language  objectives. Teachers work to ensure that students have opportunities to develop academic language and content knowledge in  English and the student's home language. 03M149 regards home languages as an instructional asses that can be leveraged to  bridge prior knowledge with new content knowledge.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status     03M149 does not have any SIFE students enrolled as of July 2017.  However, the instructional plan would be that SIFE  students would be exposed to extensive vocabulary as a method of building on the framework of their prior knowledge in  order to strengthen them in the four modalities (listening, speaking, reading and writing).     Instruction for our Newcomer students is based primarily on developing an ever-widening phonological awareness beginning  with a mastering of the alphabet as well as blends and digraphs.  03M149 uses the Fundations program in grades Kindergarten  through 2nd grade.  These students receive support through both integrated and standalone ENL instruction.  English  vocabulary acquisition is supported through visuals and connection with their home language. Our plan for Newcomer  students also includes the extensive utilization of graphic organizers and the employment of computer technology through  MyOn and i-Ready programs.      2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          87      Instruction for Developing ELLs is based on careful examination of their NYSESLAT results and the information gathered from  conferencing with their classroom and content teachers.  Developing ELLs also receive instruction in higher tier vocabulary  words, as well as, work on grammar and writing skills.  For those Developing ELLs who are still at an Entering or Emerging level,  the Fundations program will be utilized to further develop their understanding and use of English phonetics.  For Developing  ELLs who are at the Transitioning, Expanding, and Proficient levels, instruction will be focused on enhancing content area  understanding in math, social studies, and science.  All Developing ELLs utilize technology through MyOn and i-Ready  programs.  Teachers collaborate with appropriate school based staff to support students receiving additional services as  outlined by their IEP.     03M149 does not have an Long Term ELLs enrolled as of July 2017.  However, services offered would mirror that of Developing  ELLs with additional support and scaffolds aligned with each student's IEP when applicable.  Additionally, collaboration  between ENL teachers, support services, and classroom teachers occurs in order to ensure the appropriate strategies and  differentiation is being implemented for each student.    Instruction for Former ELLs includes monitoring in the form of both informal and formal assessments.  These assessments  include TCRWP running records, i-Ready assessments, unit exams, conferences, and writing samples.  Collaboration between  classroom teachers and ENL teachers also ensures that classroom teachers are provided the support they need to further the  academic growth of Former ELLs.        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   03M149 utilizes the Teachers College Reading and Writing curriculum, Bridges in Mathematics, Foss Science, and Passport to  Social Studies.  In order to provide the appropriate language scaffolds for ELL students, ENL teachers utilize multimedia visuals,  graphic organizers, and adaptive technology.  ENL teachers use academic language and content-area supports to increase ELLs  English language proficiency.  Phonics and vocabulary instruction is integrated into content area classes to promote the growth  of English proficiency.  ENL teachers ensure that the goals outlined on each student's IEP are supported through both  integrated and standalone instruction.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  03M149 utilizes multiple classroom and content area structures to ensure ELL-SWDs receive the required support to attain  English proficiency.  ELL-SWDs placed in self-contained classrooms and general education classrooms receive integrated and  standalone ENL instruction. ENL teachers work with students throughout various content areas depending on the proficiency  level of a student.  Instructional groups are modified to meet the specific IEP goals of students.  Additionally, school staff works  to provide high-quality instructional and support services for ELL-SWD students based on individual student needs.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  03M!49 utilizes Fountas and Pinnell Guided Reading programs during AIS instructional sessions and Wilson Fundations in  whole classroom and small group settings. Techniques, such as peer tutoring, semantic mapping, collaborative learning and  individualized instruction are employed as instructional strategies to facilitate language-embedded content learning. 03M149  will continuously monitor ELL student progress (e.g. student work, formal and informal assessments, test results), and  systematically adjust instructional planning based on a wide variety of evidence and data.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      03M149 has experienced an increase in ELL students enrolled in the school, a new  ENL teacher was hired for the 2017-2018  school year.  We will emphasize the use of technology to aid in the acquisition of English and home language skills.

If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   Not Applicable     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  03M149 implements an array of extracurricular, after school, and enrichment programs to all students enrolled.  Harlem  Children's Zone (HCZ) offers after school and summer programming to all students K-8th grade no matter their English  proficiency.  ELL students are also offered academic support through HCZ tutors. Harlem Lacrosse and Leadership runs both  boys and girls lacrosse teams at the middle school level that are not restricted to native English speakers.  Enrichment  programs through RoboFun, Go Skate, Super Soccer Stars, Alvin Ailey Dance, and Young People's Choir are open to all students  in certain grades regardless of their English proficiency or IEP.       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  03M149 utilizes the Fundations curriculum in primary grades and with ELL students at Entering or Emerging levels.  Classroom  instructional materials aligned with 03M149's selected curricula are also integrated into standalone instructional times.  All  classrooms contain a SMART board or Promethean board for use during instructional sessions.  Additionally, students receive  specific instruction based on a diagnostic assessment through the i-Ready computer program.  The MyOn reading program is  utilized to aid in comprehension and fluency.        13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   For the 2017-2018 school year, 03M!49 will employ a bilingual ENL teacher for the majority native language group to promote  and assess the development of home language skills.  The school offers native language literacy development and support  where possible.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    ELL students at 03M149 receive ENL instruction in grade level groups ensuring that students are paired with peers of similar  ages and English proficiency.  Books and texts of high interest to older students that are written to be accessible to students  with lower reading levels are utilized in upper elementary and middle school.  Whenever possible ENL teachers incorporate  content from classroom curriculum into ENL instruction in order to ensure that students are receiving support that  corresponds with each ELLs age and grade level.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    03M149 co-locates with other schools, however, we maintain individual school support staff and facilities.  Special education  teachers and ENL teachers maintain their own academic resources and instructional areas.  Two school based guidance  counselors and a staff member from NY Foundling provide socio-emotional support services to students. 03M149 provides  teachers with the opportunity to create intentional learning opportunities to collaborate with other staff members and attend  professional development.        16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).    2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          89         03M149 engages in a comprehensive intake process for its newcomer ELLs, administering a battery of assessments (LAB-R, i- Ready baseline assessment, and writing samples in the native language where possible) to determine native language and  content knowledge. ELLs are offered literacy development and support through TC Readers and Writers Project and i-Ready, as  well as academic interventions in addition to placement in an ESL program. 03M149's Parent Coordinator aids in enrollment  procedures including: aiding parents in completing necessary Home Language Identification Survey, communicating any  pertinent notifications to families, and conducting parent orientation meeting.  ELLs enrolling prior to the start of the school  year are given the opportunity to attend Harlem Children's Zone summer programming.       17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    03M149 does not offer language electives.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Not Applicable     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  03M149 provides and sustains opportunities for all teachers to participate in meaningful professional development in order to  ensure home language and new language development is fostered. The ENL teachers at  03M149 participate in school-wide  professional development every week around topics of instructional planning, data analysis, assessment alignment, and  pedagogical strategies.  ENL teachers also meet with instructional coaches weekly to coordinate instructional plans focused on  the implementation of building background knowledge for academic achievement strategies across all content areas to  support ELLs. ENL teachers have the opportunity to attend out of school professional development through Teachers College  Reading and Writing Project and the DOE. All teachers attend a minimum of five professional development sessions focused on  the instructional needs of ELLs.       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Weekly professional development held at 03M149 is held to provide all teachers with the tools and knowledge needed to  ensure our growing population of ELL students have the services they require to be successful.  Attendance is taken at each  professional development session and agendas are distributed and filed for school records.  All teachers attend a minimum of  five professional development sessions focused on the instructional needs of ELLs.            2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          90      Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   ENL teachers schedule annual meetings with ELL parents during school wide parent engagement and other professional work  times.  These meetings are attended by a qualified translator/interpreter in order to ensure parents are sufficiently informed  of the services their child/ren is receiving and the progress the student is making in English proficiency.  Attendance and  minutes at these meetings are taken and filed.     2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   03M149 provides parents with opportunities to be active members of the school community.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Claudia Aguirre, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          92                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PS 149                                                                              School DBN: 03M149  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

All staff are provided with Chancellor's Regulation A-663. The Language Access Coordinator is in charge of providing  all staff members with the information needed to access the free over the phone interpretation services. Resources  needed will be made available through a memo sent out by the Language access coordinator.          Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      At the entrance of our school we have a welcome sign provided by the DOE Translation and Interpretation Office that  indicates that the school can provided language resources to parents. School staff members also remind and notify  parents of their rights to language access whenever they enter the school building.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       Every year PS 149 distributes an anonymous school survey where parents can voice their opinions and concerns. This  survey is available in many languages, parents can easily access it in their preferred language. The school takes this  feedback into consideration when preparing a parent outreach plan for future events. The ENL, Parent coordinator,  Guidance Counselors and other staff members work to build a strong relationship with our parents and students. This  creates an open field of communication in order for us to receive feedback on how we can improve.         2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          97
