This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          6     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      The School for Global Leaders is located in the Marta Valle building located on the lower east side of Manhattan.  There are two additional high schools in the building; Marta Valle High School and Lower East Side Preparatory  School. The mission of The School for Global Leaders is to provide an education so that students will have academic,  social, and emotional skills to succeed in high school, college and all future endeavors. We believe that each student  has unique qualities and talents that will enable them to be leaders within the global community. Graduates of The   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8      School for Global Leaders will have the communication skills, leadership qualities and awareness of their responsibility  to advocate for change in the world.      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    The school has implemented an integrated curriculum, with an emphasis on critical-thinking and problem-solving  skills. Students understand how the academics are connected to real-world experiences through project-based and  inquiry- based, and service learning. Graduates of The School for Global Leaders will be prepared to succeed in high  school and be empowered to pursue higher education in order to advocate for global change.   Twice a year all students participate in Integrated Projects Week to complete a culminating, standards-based project,  which focus on major issues impacting the world around us. This year our student government representatives are  selecting the topics that students and teachers will work on and then teachers and students are organized in teams  according to projects and interests. Students understand how math, science, social studies, English, physical  education, and language are connected to global issues. Students are able to apply research, inquiry, and public  speaking skills to complete the projects.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Dual Language population needs ELL support and support with acquiring content knowledge in a language other than  English      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   One of the challenges that our school has overcome in the past 2 years is the daily inclusion of the Arts for our  students. When we first opened our doors in 2008 our 6th graders received disjointed pockets of Arts instruction from  teaching artists secured through a partnership with LEAP Arts. In 2012 we received a $500,000 grant from the Matisse  Foundation which has allowed us to offer a robust Arts program to all students in grades 6-8. This year we have  become an Arts in the Middle school and will continue our Lincoln Center work. Through this initiative we will be able  to provide additional visual, music and theatre Arts education in to our students. In addition we will be offering daily  Arts electives during the school day and after school, including but not limited to chorus, drama and expanded visual  arts across 6-8. Finally, we have hired a certified theatre teacher and we will be a year 2 Broadway Junior school.   Our key areas of focus for this year are: Rigorous Instruction and Supportive Environment               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 01M378   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   256   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   YES   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Needs Assessment :   Strengths: Based on our 2017-2018 School Survey 93% of of students say that they are learning a lot in their classes  at their school to prepare them for the next level or grade. In addition, 87% of our students reported that their  classes at school make them think critically.   Needs: Although students report that they are learning and being challenged, an overview of our Advance MOTP  data shows that 20% of our staff has an average score of developing for Engaging students in learning and 49% of  the staff has an average rating of Effective. This indicates that we have room to push our students past merely  compliant during learning.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          32      achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. The School for Global Leaders, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I,  Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   School for Global Leaders will support parents and families of Title I students by:   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement  level, e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology;  ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning  and decision making in support of the education of their children;  ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support  and monitor their child’s progress;  ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;  ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format,  and in languages that parents can understand;  ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to  improve outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between  parents and other members of the school community;         The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34   Parental Involvement and School Quality      school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of  the school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School  Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their  members for additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:  ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the  school’s Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the  implementation of the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;  ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are  allocated directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting  skills;  ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and  strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team,  the Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

This data is recorded in a Google Document that is shared with  teachers school-wide so that all content area teachers can differentiate instruction for ELLs and use leveled texts  appropriately. Teachers also use reading levels to create strategic instructional groups. ELA and ENL teachers may use running  records to plan additional language-embedded activities for ELL students including targeted small-group vocabulary and  grammar instruction.        The Slosson Oral Reading Test (SORT) is administered as a universal screen for students who may require Academic  Intervention Services, including ELLs. Based on the results of this assessment, students are placed in small-group guided   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      reading, using the Fountas and Pinnell leveled literacy system. The ENL teacher delivers stand-alone guided reading instruction  for ELLs. For students who may be SIFE or ELLs with Disabilities, the Wilson Word Identification and Spelling Test (WIST) is used  in lieu of the SORT for a more detailed and comprehensive assessment of decoding and encoding needs. Data from the SORT  and WIST is collected three times per year and updated in a Google Document shared among the ELA team.        During guided reading periods, teachers collect observational data during timed student read-aloud conferences. Teachers  record any miscues or self-corrections made by the student, as well as a timed oral reading rate. The ENL teacher uses echo- reading and choral reading to raise student oral reading fluency levels. Teachers also collect data from checks for  understanding about the passages read during guided reading.        The school uses the Teacher's College Reading and Writing Project (TCRWP) curriculum for ELA instruction. In addition to  running records, students complete on-demand writing assessments at the beginning and end of each instructional unit.  Teachers collect data from on-demand assessments using a unit skills tracker. Patterns and trends are shared across teachers  during ELA department meetings in order to inform instruction.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?        Running Records are updated and shared with teachers school-wide in a Google Document. The ELA department sets  benchmark goals to complete and update these running records charts at the beginning, middle and end of each school year.  SORT and WIST data is collected and shared in a Google Document among ELA and ENL teachers.       During ELA team meetings, teachers analyze data collected from student on-demand writing assessments. Skills trackers are  attached to unit plans, and the patterns and trends are used to make curricular revisions by updating future units to address  student needs. Templates used during guided reading periods and individual reading conference forms are shared among  teachers in the ELA department.       3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?       The NYSITELL and NYSESLAT are used as baseline assessments in order to analyze and track ELL progress. Each fall, the ENL  teacher analyzes data and generates a breakdown of ELL students by grade level and language proficiency level (entering,  emerging, transitioning, expanding, commanding). This document is shared with content teachers during a school-wide  Professional Learning Opportunity about English Language Learners at the beginning of the year.        ELL Periodic Assessments are administered in the fall and spring by the ENL teacher in order to monitor student progress  throughout the year. Specific instructional areas of need in listening, reading and writing are determined by the modality  scores from the periodic assessments and NYSITELL/NYSESLAT. The ELL Data Analysis Tool and ELA/Math Item Analysis reports  are used to further analyze ELL subgroups and achievement data.       The Spanish LAB is administered during the initial enrollment period for newly identified ELLs. The results are used to  determine whether native language supports are appropriate for students. The Chinese Reading Test is administered to all  students in the Mandarin Chinese Dual Language program.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?         Based on NYSITELL/NYSESLAT data, students are programmed for integrated and stand-alone ENL services per CR Part 154-2  regulations. All entering and emerging-level ELLs in grades 6-8 receive four periods weekly or 180 minutes of stand-alone ENL  instruction. All ELLs from entering to expanding proficiency levels receive four periods weekly or 180 minutes of integrated  ENL/ELA instruction.       As stated above, once data from the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT is analyzed by the ENL teacher, student performance levels are  shared with content teachers during a beginning of year school-wide PLO. The ENL teacher shares instructional resources  including the NYSED bilingual content glossaries, translated state assessments from EngageNY, and bilingual dictionaries with  content teachers. These resources are used in all content-area classrooms to support the instruction of ELLs.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]        As outlined in the ELL Policy and Reference Guide, ELLs who do not make adequate yearly progress on the NYSESLAT  and ELA/Math exams are provided with additional Academic Intervention Services (AIS). In addition to assessment data, other  evidence including the number of years in an ENL program, home language literacy, SIFE status, and social-emotional needs of   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41         students are considered. Following an RtI approach, instructional supports are layered in three tiers of intensity in order to  identify, target and prevent at-risk students from falling behind. Tier I includes rigorous core classroom instruction that targets  academic oral language proficiency as well as literacy skills. Students in need of Tier II supports receive extra instruction in  small groups during integrated or standalone periods. The ENL teacher follows the guided reading curriculum used by the  ELA department for Tier II interventions. Tier III supports are delivered during integrated and standalone periods via 1:1  individual student:teacher conferences. For ELLs these supports may include using bilingual glossaries and dictionaries,  translated assessments, and targeted vocabulary and grammar instruction as appropriate.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].        The ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS are used to evaluate ELL student performance on the NYSITELL/NYSESLAT,  ELA, Math, and Science State Exams. Curricular revisions such as adjustments to unit plans, additional lessons and/or  instructional small groups to address skill gaps are made based on this data.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?        As stated above, there are several shared Google Documents that are used school-wide to track student progress. The ENL  teacher also leads quarterly Professional Learning Opportunities to analyze this data and to share quarterly benchmark goals  for ELLs of different proficiency levels.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.        The ENL program provides ELL students with English language instruction using home language support. The  emphasis of the ENL program is English language acquisition across modalities through explicit listening, speaking,  reading and writing activities. The students in our ENL program come from many different language backgrounds.  When possible, students work collaboratively in home language groups or high-low English proficiency pairs in order  to foster explicit language development and content knowledge.       Stand-alone ENL small groups are created according to NYSESLAT proficiency, reading and grade level. Students at  the entering and emerging levels receive 1 unit of study, or 180 minutes a week in stand-alone ENL class. As stated  above, stand-alone ENL instruction targets English language skills using a guided reading curriculum. The ENL teacher  chooses non-fiction texts that address appropriate grade-level science or social studies content. This method expands  students' prior knowledge and prepares them for classroom instruction by content teachers. The flow of a typical  guided reading period includes a brief introduction to the text or topic, followed by independent reading time with  1:1 conferences, a small-group discussion of the text and word work on either a vocabulary or grammar skill.       All ELLs and former-ELLs, from entering through commanding levels, receive 1 unit of study, or 180 minutes a week  of integrated ENL services. This is achieved by grouping all ELLs and former-ELLs in one class per grade. This way, the  ENL teacher is able to co-plan and co-teach with one ELA teacher per grade level. Integrated instruction is designed to  build English language skills through targeted differentiation and scaffolding. The ENL and ELA teachers follow the  school-wide TCRWP units, sequence of lessons, and assessments.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Not applicable.    c.  DL program.  If applicable.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42              The Mandarin Chinese Dual Language program is designed to continue students' literacy and language  development in their home language as well as English. There are also English-proficient students in the program who  are learning Mandarin Chinese as a heritage or new language. In this way, students in the program are able to support  each other in their mutual language-learning process. Currently, 50% of students in the Dual Language program are  English Language Learners while the other 50% of students are English-Proficient.      The program follows a 50/50 model. For Dual Language classes, ELA is co-taught by a content teacher with the ENL  teacher. Students also receive a period of Native Language Arts from the Mandarin Language teacher. The Mandarin  Language teacher also delivers instruction in Math and Science content areas in English and Mandarin on alternating  days. In this way, 50% of content instruction takes place in English and Mandarin.    2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?        Stand-alone ENL small groups are created according to NYSESLAT proficiency, reading and grade level. Students at the  entering and emerging levels receive 1 unit of study, or 180 minutes a week in stand-alone ENL class.  All ELLs and former-ELLs,  from entering through commanding levels, receive 1 unit of study, or 180 minutes a week of integrated ENL services. This is  achieved by grouping all ELLs and former-ELLs in one class per grade. This way, the ENL teacher is able to co-plan and co- teach with one ELA teacher per grade level.        In the Dual Language program, students receive 1 unit of study or 180 minutes per week in integrated ENL/ELA. ELLs also  receive 180 minutes of stand-alone ENL (together with ELL students not in Dual Lanugage). Students also receive an additional  180 minutes of Home Language Arts from the Mandarin teacher.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.        In the ENL program model, both integrated and stand-alone instruction is delivered in English. This is achieved by using  differentiated texts according to student reading levels. During stand-alone guided reading periods, the ENL teacher front- loads both academic and content-specific vocabulary for each unit of study. Through targeted and strategic vocabulary  instruction, students build prior knowledge essential to their success in content classes. ELA, Math and Science classes are  taught by content teachers exclusively in English. However, when appropriate, home language supports may also be used to  support ELL students in their content classes. For example, students are explicitly taught to use bilingual reference materials  such as word-for-word dictionaries, NYSED content glossaries, and assistive technology. Many audio and visual supports are  also used by teachers in the delivery of content instruction in order to maximize comprehensible input. ELL students work in  collaborative groups across proficiency levels and English-proficient students in order to foster academic language  development. Teachers plan high-level student discussion activities throughout different core content classes. These  instructional strategies are designed to move our ELLs towards meeting the demands of the Common Core Learning  Standards.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?        The Spanish LAB is administered during the initial enrollment period for newly identified ELLs. The results are used to  determine whether native language supports are appropriate for students. The Chinese Reading Test is administered to all  students in the Mandarin Chinese Dual Language program. ELL students are also able to take translated versions of the NYS  Math and Science exams in their home language.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43      A. Instruction for SIFE students is designed with the purpose of building background content knowledge along with targeted  literacy instruction. These students receive Tier I-III RtI interventions as described above. Teachers are also trained to support  the unique social-emotional needs of SIFE in order to acclimate them to the culture of school in a positive manner. Technology  is used as much as possible in order to bridge the gaps in SIFE students' academic and linguistic needs. Many of our science  and math content teachers are bilingual and when possible, oral translations are delivered in the students' home language to  support their academic development.   B. Many of our recent newcomer ELLs enter with strong literacy skills in their home language. This advantage is utilized as  much as possible in order to differentiate instruction for this subgroup. Translated textbooks are used in content classes where  available, and students are encouraged to read independently in their home language as well. Maintaining their home  language literacy skills supports their learning of appropriate grade-level content while they learn the English language.  C. Developing ELLs benefit greatly from heterogeneous grouping with English-proficient students. Content teachers pair  students according to home language when possible in mixed high-low English language proficiencies. In this manner, students  are encouraged to work collaboratively in order to attain content knowledge, and the strategic use of discussion techniques  reinforces their academic language development. Literacy skills for these students are addressed during small group  instruction and integrated ELA class.   D. Instruction for long-term ELLs is focused on building literacy skills across content areas. These students receive targeted  academic intervention services, including guided reading groups and small group instruction. With teacher support, close  reading strategies are emphasized across content areas with specific attention to accuracy, fluency and comprehension.   E. Former-ELLs are entitled to receive ELL services for up to two years after testing out of ELL status. Although home language  texts are no longer necessary for these students, bilingual dictionaries and glossaries remain useful as students engage with  higher academic content and language demands as they progress through the grade levels. Continued explicit word work  strategies, including decoding multi-syllabic words, targeted vocabulary, morphological prefixes, suffixes and latin root words  are emphasized in instruction for this subgroup.   All ELLs, across subgroups and including former-ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status, are provided with appropriate  testing accommodations on both classroom and state assessments including extended time, separate location, small group  size, bilingual content glossaries, dictionaries and translated language materials.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?        Our school instructional model aims to provide students with many opportunities to work collaboratively in small groups,  engage in high-level academic discussions using accountable talk, and choose from appropriate individual scaffolds as needed.  Embedded within these school-wide goals are many instructional strategies that provide ELL-SWDs access to academic content  areas and English language development. For ELL-SWDs, the opportunity to work in small groups with students of higher  language proficiency on a daily basis is essential to their English language development. Students may be provided with  accountable talk prompts, graphic organizers or guided question stems to scaffold their understanding. Teachers also create  instructional scaffolds for ELL-SWDs that include labeled pictures, drawings and diagrams of content vocabulary words and  concepts. Teachers also explicitly model problem-solving steps for students using color-coded examples and mentor texts.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?       ELL-SWDs are programmed flexibly per their IEP within the least restrictive environment. The ENL teacher collaborates with  Special Education teachers in order to design coherent instruction for these students, and instruction is provided in integrated  ENL services. Teachers of ELL-SWDs use grade-level materials that are aligned with the Common Core State Standards, but  with appropriate accommodations and modifications per IEP and classification. Texts are leveled according to student running  records; visual supports such as pictures, charts and diagrams are frequently used in instruction; tiered vocabulary words are  taught explicitly to students; interactive technology and audio and visual supports are also used as often as possible.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44           ELLs are programmed to receive targeted interventions in ELA and math based on their scores from the NYS ELA and math  exams. Depending on student needs, these interventions may range from in-class small groups, pull-out small groups and/or  1:1 student:teacher conferences. Most frequently the students targeted are from the long-term, SIFE or ELL-SwDs subgroups.  All academic intervention services are offered exclusively in English.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?           The guided reading program used during pull-out academic intervention services for ELA was a new initiative this school  year that proved extremely successful. Based on data, students increased at least three to five reading levels this year. In the  upcoming school year, we will continue to use a Teacher’s College consultant to provide professional development for  teachers in guided reading instructional practices. The ELA department is also planning to roll out more cohesive "word work"  lessons embedded in writing workshop three times per unit. These lessons will target specific language objectives to lift the  level of student writing.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   n/a     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.       Our ELL students are afforded equal access to all school programs. ELLs are programmed into our Restorative Circles and  Advisory groups as well as elective courses such as visual art, health, and physical education. Our school has an independent  after school program, and many of their staff are bilingual in order to serve our student population and their families. We  ensure that all applications and required documents are translated and available in the preferred home languages as  necessary.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.       For newcomer ELLs, the ENL program uses the Heinle Milestones curriculum as well as Rosetta Stone with the Wilson  Reading System for support as needed. Our school uses Connected Math Project 3 curriculum, Glencoe New York Science, and  Houghton Mifflin Harcourt United States History. These math, science and social studies texts are available in translated  editions. Technology is utilized as often as possible in order to support ELLs. Some interactive online resources include  BrainPop, Reading A-Z, IXL for Language and Math, Duolingo, and Colorín Colorado.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?        In our ENL program, the student’s home language is used as an instructional support for content understanding. The  teacher provides oral translations during instruction only when necessary. Translated texts and bilingual glossaries are  provided as appropriate per student home language literacy skills.         For the Mandarin Chinese Dual Language program, the students' home language is assessed using the Chinese Reading Test.  Based on the results of this assessment, students are placed in instructional groups and receive differentiated home language  instruction.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    ELLs are placed in cohort classes according to grade level. Integrated ENL services follow the appropriate grade-level  curriculum for students across all proficiency levels. Stand-alone ENL classes are scheduled to accommodate students within  no more than two contiguous grades.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?         Our school is co-located; however our schools are staffed independently. We share common spaces including the gym,  auditorium, and cafeteria. At the beginning of the school year, the ENL and Dual Language teachers take ELL students on an  orientation tour of the building. Students are explicitly taught how to read their program schedules, and room numbers and  names of their teachers are color-coded with signs on classroom doors. The ENL teacher and Dual Language teachers meet  frequently to discuss the academic and linguistic progress of ELLs, as well as any social and cultural needs they may have.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45         During our Restorative Circles and Advisory periods, teachers are assigned small groups of ELL students in order to discuss their  socio-emotional needs. The ENL and DL teachers also maintain close contact with each students' parent/guardians, ensuring a  smooth adjustment to school expectations.      16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).        Our parent coordinator and school counselor are both bilingual in Spanish and English. They work together with the ENL and  Dual Language teachers who are bilingual in Chinese in order to assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school  year. We hold an open house for accepted students in order to provide school tours, translated school calendars, school supply  lists, assistance with uniform purchases and team-building workshops and games. Throughout the school year, the guidance  counselor provides workshops for parents about the SHSAT, high school articulation process and how to plan for college. The  parent coordinator with the PTA provide parent workshops and parent-student activities such as movie night, game night, arts  and crafts and more.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?         Our school currently offers Mandarin Chinese and Spanish as alternating foreign language electives. ELLs are included in  these classes, and where appropriate the teacher develops home language literacy skills with ELL students during this time.        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   A. The school uses a self-contained dual language model. English-Proficient and ELL students are  integrated for the entire school day. 50% of students in the class are English-Proficient while 50% are  English Language Learners.   B. The core content areas of math and science are taught in Mandarin Chinese and English on alternating  school days. In addition, students receive English Language Arts in English and Native Language Arts in  Mandarin each day.   C. The language of instruction for math and science alternates every other day. All instructional materials  such as textbooks, charts, word walls, and student worksheets are translated to match the language of  instruction. This ensures both instructional continuity and an immersive language environment.   D. Both languages are taught simultaneously. The ELA and NLA teachers follow the Teachers' College  Reading and Writing Project strategy-based instruction for reading and writing.      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?       Professional development for all teachers of ELLs will be provided in order to meet the minimum fifteen percent of required  professional development hours dedicated to language acquisition. Topics will include co-teaching strategies and integrating  language and content instruction for ELLs. For the ENL and Dual Language teachers, the minimum of fifty percent of the  required professional development hours will be achieved through district and borough PD sessions along with webinars and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46         conferences offered by the professional community. Professional development sessions will be offered to all teachers of  ELLs in order to implement the Bilingual Common Core Progressions. Resources will be used from the EngageNY website.      2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.       The ENL and Dual Language teachers are responsible for ensuring that the professional development requirements per CR  Part 154 are met for all teachers of ELLs. They plan and implement professional development for teachers as well as keep  appropriate documentation of meeting agendas and attendance records. These records are logged in a Google Drive document  that is shared with the school administrative team.        Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?        The ENL teacher is able to conduct individual parent meetings in the high-incidence languages of Mandarin Chinese, Spanish  and French (Haitian Creole). At the beginning of each school year, she personally calls the parents/guardians of each ELL  student and invites them to school in order to discuss the ENL and Dual Language program goals, their  child's NYSESLAT/NYSITELL as well as ELA and Math State exam assessment results. For parents whose preferred language is  any other language, the ENL teacher reaches out to the Translation and Interpretation Unit for assistance.     2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.        Our school organizes many events throughout the school year to encourage ELL parent involvement. All school-related  notices such as monthly school calendars, newsletters and invitations to parent events are translated into Mandarin Chinese  and Spanish. Oral translation services are provided at all parent-teacher conferences and PTA meetings. The parent  coordinator and PTA organize monthly events such as movie night, game night, arts and craft nights, author's chair, and  athletic awards ceremonies.            Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Keri Ricks, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to and  staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   The School for Global Leaders                                                                              School DBN: 01M378  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      The data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written and  oral communication include the following:    *Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey    *ATS Report of Preferred Languages    *Student Emergency Contact Cards (Blue cards)    *Parent In-house Surveys (collected per grade)    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      *Student In-house Surveys (collected per class)    The school uses the data culled from these documents in order to compile a mater registry of students and their  preferred home languages. For each grade and class, there is a Google Sheet document that is shared school-wide  between administrators, secretaries, guidance counselors, teachers and paraprofessionals that list the names of  students and their family members whose preferred languages are any language other than English. This  document is maintained and updated regularly by the parent coordinator. Each grade is assigned a bilingual  Spanish and Mandarin Chinese staff member who acts as the point person for translating and logging  communication with parents in languages other than English.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     Written Preferred    Percent Written          Oral Preferred    Percent Oral          Language    According to the 2015  ATS (RHLA) report, we  have the following  preferred languages:    *Bengali: 2.2%    *Mandarin 20%    *Spanish: 16.2%    *Thai: .3%            3.
