This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   STAR Early College School strives to promote and maintain a nurturing and rigorously challenging college oriented  learning environment. STAR prepares all students to take college courses at Brooklyn College as part of the early  college experience and equips students to pursue professional careers in science, mathematics, technology and  related areas. Our learning community helps students to achieve the core values of STAR:   Striving for success;       Tolerance in a multicultural society;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10           Academic integrity;     Responsibility for self and others.   2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    One of five small public schools on the historic Erasmus Hall Campus in Brooklyn, Science, Technology and Research  (STAR) Early College School opened in fall 2003. STAR currently serves 585 students in grades 6–12. The school  population comprises 76% Black, 16% Hispanic, 4% Asian, 3% American Indian or Alaskan Native, and 1% White  students. The student body includes 1.5% English Language Learners and 16% are Students with Special Needs. Boys  account for 53% of the students enrolled and girls account for 47%. The average attendance rate for the school year  2017-2018 was 96.3%. About 68 percent of our students are from low-income backgrounds, based on their eligibility  for federally subsidized free or reduced-price lunch programs. More than a quarter of the students arrive in sixth  grade with reading and math skills that are below proficiency as measured by New York State assessments in fifth  grade.   STAR’s mission is to help students succeed in high school while simultaneously preparing them for the rigors of  college. The curriculum focuses on preparing students to pursue careers in science, mathematics, technology, and  related professions. STAR’s a mile away. However, students also have the opportunity to accumulate up to 73  transferable credits toward a college degree. STAR provides both the academic supports and the financial assistance  to help students succeed. All of the college preparation experiences as well as the college courses themselves are  tuition free.   Each of STAR’s partners contributes to the success of its students. Brooklyn College and the Gateway Institute for Pre- College Education at the City University of New York (CUNY) were involved in the creation of STAR, serve on its  executive board, and continue to have prominent roles in its implementation. Brooklyn College offers and staffs all of  STAR’s college courses and places students appropriately. With the leadership of the early college liaison at the  college, Brooklyn College’s faculty and staff have worked closely with their counterparts at STAR to continually refine  the academic plan and provide support structures that assist students’ transition from high school to college. The  Gateway Institute arranges internships and research projects, coordinates college fairs and tours, and co-facilitates  the college preparatory course for STAR students.   As a public school, STAR receives typical resources and guidance from the New York City Department of Education and  through external partners and support organizations like CUNY, which provides direct technical assistance to schools,  peer networking opportunities for principals, college liaisons, and lead teachers, and data and analytical support.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Our middle schools students with special needs and those in special populations are on average performing at a lower  proficiency levels on the State English and mathematics tests than their peers. To meet NY State standards for  proficiency in English and mathematics, as measured by the State tests, students must obtain a score between 3.00  and 4.50. Last year, our middle school students had an average English proficiency rate of 3.08 and an average math  proficiency rate of 2.90. Our special student populations in grade 6-8 achieved lower proficiency rates on both the  State English and math tests:    English Proficiency Rates for Special Populations:          students in our lowest third had an average English proficiency of 2.54.  students in our ICT/SETSS had an average English proficiency of 2.26.  students in our ELL classes had an average English proficiency of 2.41.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      Math Proficiency Rates for Special Populations          students in our lowest third had an average math proficiency of 2.24  students in our ICT/SETSS had an average math proficiency of 2.26   students in our ELL classes had an average math proficiency of 2.41.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   In the 2017-18 school year, Science, Technology and Research Early College High School made the most progress in  Rigorous Instruction. Through the implementation of a grand strategy and effective progress monitoring, the  percentage of students who are graduating our high school college ready increased by 25% from 64% in 2015-16 to  89% in 2016-17. While our high school experienced outstanding gains in college and career readiness, our middle  school students performance was uneven. In 2018, 69% of our middle school students received a Level 3 or 4 with an  average proficiency rate of 3.30 on the N.Y.S English Language Art's exam. This means that 31% of our students were  not meeting the NY Common Core State Standards for English. In 2018, 53% of our middle school students received a  Level 3 or 4 with an average proficiency rate of 3.02 on the N.Y.S Mathematics exam. Put differently, 47% of our  middle school students were not proficient in a wide variety of NY Common Core State Standards for mathematics.  According to the School Quality Snapshot, 2017-18, our middle school is getting "Excellent" results in helping our  lowest performing students improve on their New York State English tests and "Excellent" results in helping our  lowest performing students improve on their New York State Math tests. After disaggregating the N.Y. state ELA and  Math test results, we noticed an achievement gap between the "average" students and those who are part of our  special populations:    Priority Focus: Closing the achievement gap in the percentage of students in our special populations who are meeting  NY State standards of proficiency, as measured by the summative NY State English and Math test. Disaggregated NY  State English test results for our special populations indicate:   On the 2017-18 N.Y.S ELA test, 69% of our students in grades 6-8 received a Level 3 or 4 with an average proficiency  rate of 3.30. According to the N.Y. State ELA test the average English proficiency rates of our middle school's special  populations are:           students in our lowest third had an average English proficiency of 2.70.  students in our ICT/SETSS had an average English proficiency of 2.53.  students in our self-contained classes had an average English proficiency of 2.38.

Teachers see assessment at the beginning of  each cycle so they are able to define a road map  for teaching. Assessments will be aligned to  state standards and college readiness index.  Assessments will be aligned to instructional  sequence of clearly defined grade level content  expectations. Teachers will reassess previously  taught standards.    4) On a monthly basis, our schools data team  will analyze the periodic assessment results of  our target groups performance in Algebra I (CC)  or Geometry (CC) and in English Language Arts  (CC) to determine if students are on track or if  students are struggling and why. Teachers will  use this information to implement new teaching  plans to respond to this analysis. We will create  new systems and procedures to ensure  continual data driven improvement with a  special focus helping students met CUNY’s  standard for College Readiness in Math and  English, as measured by the New York State  Regents Exams on the Algebra I (CC) or  Geometry (CC) and the English Language Arts  (CC) Regents. The results of this data analysis,  will determine how we shift our curriculum and  instructional priorities.    5) Prepare students to take the New York State  Regents Exams for Algebra I (CC) or Geometry  (CC) and/or the English Language Arts (CC)  Regents in January, June and/or August, if  necessary.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  STAR is a screened 6-12 Early College school with a register of 585 students. For three years, the percentage of  students with special needs have expanded to comprise 16% of our total students. According to the data on our  middle school quality snapshot (2016-17) and our school performance dashboard (2017) students with special needs  and those in special populations are meeting NY State standards on the State English Language Arts and mathematics  tests with a Level 3 or 4 at a much lower percentage than the average middle school student. It is our goal to close  this achievement gap and ensure that all of our students have access to a rigorous curriculum and acquire the  necessary skills to meet State standards for proficiency in English and mathematics so they are even more prepared  for high school, college and career.   We believe all children deserve such environments and that all children have the potential to learn and succeed. That  means, first and foremost, that our schools must be safe. It also means that in keeping them safe, we must preserve  their essential character as places of learning.   We also believe that overly punitive methods of discipline are not in the best interests of students, fail to advance  school safety and can harm students’ long-term potential. Research has shown that students facing disciplinary  measures, and the schools they attend, are better served by providing positive supports that teach students the  social, emotional and behavioral skills necessary to participate and learn. Therefore, we will train our school  personnel in research-driven best practices on how to provide these supports, including providing enhanced support  to students with special needs or those suffering from trauma due to exposure to poverty or violence. We recognize  that some staff will need additional resources and training, which is why we will provide the staffing support needed  to implement progressive forms of discipline, de-escalation theory and Social Emotion Learning (SEL) curriculum. We  will build on successful DOE models to simultaneously improve school climate and safety. In this way, STAR will  reduce the use of suspensions as a disciplinary tool for minor school misbehavior while continuing to advance school  safety.   The manner in which students conduct themselves in school is a major factor in establishing and maintaining a safe  and respectful school community. To promote positive student behavior, all members of the school community —  students, staff and parents — must know and understand, the standards of behavior which all students are expected  to live up to, the supports and interventions that will be used to address misconduct, and the disciplinary  consequences if behavioral standards are not met.

The Strategic Interim Assessment Plan (SIAP) is a set of interacting standards-aligned assessments that can provide  valuable information at different points of the year about student learning, instructional outcomes, and progress  towards goals.   As we increase rigor in the classroom, we need a way to identify specific areas of strength and needs in order to  provide targeted instruction for all students. Understanding how our students are learning and growing on a regular  basis is fundamental to achieving our goal of preparing all STAR students to graduate ready for college and careers.   Assessments given throughout the year, particularly common assessments across a grade or subject, play a crucial  role in tracking growth in teaching and learning, identifying gaps and trends, and reflecting on and adjusting  instruction to meet student needs.   In developing a framework for the SIAP, we will consider the following principles:   Instructionally valuable: Assessments should support educators to make instructional decisions.  Support development: Assessments should help educators improve their practice and student growth.  Standards-aligned: Assessments must be aligned to state and/or district developed standards.           Reliable and valid: Assessments must provide a consistent and accurate measure of student learning.     Fair: Assessments must not disadvantage students based on their background and educators based on the  population of students we serve.  Feasible: Assessment should be implemented without undue burden.      Assessments provided through the Strategic Interim Assessment Plan are designed to support the development of a  strategic assessment plan to help track growth in teaching and learning, identifying gaps and trends, and monitoring  academic progress along the way. Data from different assessments can be used to:     Help teachers and schools make more informed decisions about curriculum, instruction, and professional   learning.     Monitor student progress and mastery towards learning goals.    Ensure teaching and learning are aligned with the expectations of the Common Core Learning Standards.     Set and monitor progress towards other related Comprehensive Education Plans (CEP) or any other school- wide goals.   Our Strategic Interim Assessment Plan contains different assessment moments at different points in the year that  provide opportunities to reflect on student learning and teacher practice. These assessments range from informal  checks for understanding embedded in lessons to End-of-Year assessments that measure student mastery of a set of  key year-long standards. The following framework briefly outlines the purpose of different types of assessment   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          30      included in a strategic assessment plan. The graphic represents one way a school may think about their strategic  assessment plan across grades in a given year.   1.  Baseline assessments are administered at the beginning of the year to gauge students’ starting points.  2.  Curriculum-embedded assessments and checks for understanding are used on an ongoing basis to provide   teachers with immediate feedback on student learning.   3.  Benchmark assessments are administered periodically throughout the year to track student mastery of key   concepts and standards over time to inform instructional, curricular, and professional development decisions.  Assessments cover current mastery of standards (or a subset of standards) that may be assessed formally at  the end of the course.   4.  End-of-Year assessments are administered at the end of a course to measure student mastery of standards.   Assessments typically cover a broader range of concepts and skills, and results may be used to measure  student growth from the start of the year for the purpose of evaluation.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   STAR Early College School's instructional core, school culture and systems for improvement are exceptional, as  evidenced by our numerous well-developed ratings on our last Quality Review from 2014-15. Other data, such as our  Learning Environment Surveys from FY'15 - FY'17, the Great Schools Report's from FY'16 - FY'17, our rising College  Readiness Indicator (CRI) and New York State Regents results and the most recent NY State English Language Arts and  Math Exam results strengthen this claim. Despite our extensive investment in after school instructional and extra  curricular programs to ensure that our students are continuously achieving at the highest levels, we are continuously  searching for creative ways to find more time for our teachers to collaborate - during and after the regular school day  - to focus on developing professional networks and share their best practices with one another. We believe, this  investment will help to move the needle in the right direction. This summer we continued to search for an innovative  approach to scheduling our teachers and students time, so we can leverage our professional and collective wisdom  during regular school hours to learn about learning and continuously drive student achievement. To this effect, we  discovered that if we fully optimized teacher and student schedules, then our middle school teachers would gain an  additional 45 minutes per day. This time could be used to collaborative develop curriculum, improve existing  instructional agendas and work with families to develop more exciting ways to challenge our students, align their  curriculum to even more rigorous standards and prepare our middle school to met New York States standards for  English and math proficiency. With a little bit of fine tuning the leadership clearly articulates the vision and mission of  the school to all members of the school community and motivates all members of our school community and staff to  carry out our annual goals, while paying homage to our school wide instructional focus and theory of action.    Strengths:     Teacher teams regularly plan and revise curricula and their curriculum to ensure it is aligned to the CCLS,   content standards and instructional shifts.     Teachers have embraced the tenets of Charlotte Danielson's Framework for Teaching (FfT) and aligned their   pedagogy and curricula.      Curricula aligned assessment practices provide actionable feedback, and assessment analysis of needed      curricula and instructional adjustments.   Student Performance between Baseline and End of Year assessments indicate positive academic growth over  time.      Teachers receive Professional Development that is job embedded, needs based, coherently focused and   sustained, however.      Resources are aligned to support our schools instructional goals.    Data informs our school wide goals, action plans and professional development.     House System, which enhances and unleashes our students and staff members academic and athletic   competitiveness, while strengthening all of our relationships through shared mission, vision, goal and house.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39        Community Meetings - Through group dynamics the administration, guidance counselors, support staff and  student leaders meet with an entire grade of students on a monthly basis to take stock of student academic  progress, hold data talks, discuss upcoming events, get input, increase our students efficacy and voice.

For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Research shows that when parents involvement and participation in their child's school is high there is a co- relationship with higher academic performance, achievement, improved attendance rates and higher graduation rates  to name a few. While STAR has always had high parent turnout at a general school meeting, scheduled parent-teacher  conference, school or class event, or willingness to volunteer in the school or serving on a school committee, we  recognize that parents are not always able to make it to every school function. Nonetheless, research indicates that it  is not because of a lack or want or interest. Often it is due to other competing responsibilities or challenges which  may include financial, work related and child care etc. Despite these challenges our parents persist and show up  because they want to find out how their child is performing and progressing. Therefore, we believe, if parents have  ongoing access to our school community - in person and online - they will be able to have even more impactful  influence in their child's academic trajectory, which is why registering parents PupilPath account can be a watershed  moment in their life and our school. With full and real time information on their child's grades, attendance and  progress, parents who are very busy, will be able to optimize the time they spend talking to their children to ensure  they are performing at or above standard, submitting assignments in a timely manner, demonstrating appropriate  behavior and attending school every day and getting to class in a timely manner. Armed with this information, parents  and members of the school community will be able to speak with one voice on ways to make a huge difference in the  educational outcomes for all of our students.

Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     At the beginning of the year, teacher teams analyze various data (baseline, periodic, mid-year and end of year  assessments, which may also include, prior year Regents and New York State English Language Arts and Mathematics  test results for our students in 6th through 8th grade, scholarship reports) for holistic areas in need of improvement.  Professional Learning is centered on these areas and shared school wide. Action plans and /or next steps are  developed in order to create a cohesive corrective action plan that is adaptable and/or transferable based on the  needs of the specific population(s).During the school year, Professional Learning Teams begin to analyze other  (formative) data in an effort to readjust curricula and teaching to impact student learning. Teacher teams meet  regularly to analyze student work, provide actionable feedback and discuss pedagogical approaches and/or share best  practices.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57        Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Parent Involvement Policy (PIP): Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental  involvement and student achievement. The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that  will ensure effective engagement of parents and community in the school.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?    At the beginning of the school year, we provide students and parents with the home language survey. If we get a response  that the home language is other then English, we administer the LAB R battery. The results of the LAB R informs us as to  whether to call the parent in for the initial meeting describing all three methods for language acquisition and informing them  of their rights and responsibilities with respect to choice.        2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   At  our orientation for new students (usually  held in June of the previous school year)  all new students/ families who did not  come from another NYCDOE public school are asked to complete the Home Language Survey. The results of the survey are  used as a basis for LAB-R administration and parent informational meeting. All teachers receive Professional Development  (internal and external) with respect to the programs offered at STAR and the role and responsibility of the teacher.

If necessary, outreach to others schools on  campus (who may offer programs and/or resources we do not) is utilized to assist in all students need being met.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  For the student who is a first time entrant to NYCDOE and whose home language survey indicates a language other than  English, the results of the LAB R are used as a baseline. Teachers will than collaborate with support staff to develop a plan to  address specific challenge areas of each student. Teacher will also work with ENL instruction specialist (both internally and  externally) to develop formative and informative assessment batteries which will be used to measure individual and collective  student progress. For the student who has taken a NYSELAT, the assessment will be used as a baseline. Students will than be  supported with appropriate level tasks. Once again, teacher will work with support specialist to develop formative and  informative assessment and tasks which will be used to measure progress. Finally, in accordance with CR-154 all former ENL  students will continue to be supported with appropriate level tasks and assessments.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Please see above (question 3)     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   All ENL students at STAR are  placed in  shared instruction ENL classrooms at either our school or our partner school on the  campus where he/she receives the appropriate level of ENL instruction.The ENL teacher along with the general education  teacher  would use a range of instructional methods to ensure that students are building comprehension across all content  areas along with linguistic knowledge, development, and performance in English. All units are thematic-based and designed  around an essential question. The essential question is then explored and developed through all genres of literature, including  fiction, content-area texts, informational readings, poetry, historical non-fiction, and drama. In addition, ENL texts and  teacher-generated ENL lessons are utilized to teach   English across all content areas. Instruction would be  differentiated to meet the needs of all ENL learners. Classroom libraries  would be equipped with glossaries and\or dictionaries reflective of the home language of the ENL students.       By meeting with content area teachers by grade level and by subject area, the ENL teacher learns which material needs  scaffolding support in the ENL class and suggests differentiation and scaffolding that can be put in place by the content teacher  in order to provide the ENL students with access to the content curriculum.     All content at STAR would be delivered in English. Some support in Spanish and/or French is given in the ENL classroom. The  ENL teacher does not speak Arabic, Nepalese, or Russian so English is the mode of communication in the ENL classroom as  well.   Whenever possible, staff members who may speak other languages are utilized to support instruction. At STAR we  currently have staff members who speak Spanish, French, Creole and Russian.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The NYSELAT coupled with the NYS ELA  level will be used to evaluate progress and/or inform ENL programmatic  decisions.  Students who  score an (EX) level on the NYSELAT but do not meet the threshold of scoring a level 3 or 4 on the NYS  ELA  Test will receive 180 minutes a week of instruction. Students who  score a (EM) on the NYSELAT and do not score a level 3  or 4 on the NYSELA test will receive 360 minutes of ENL instruction per week. The ELL Data Analysis Tool  will be consulted for  any new (to the school) student.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Results of the NYSELAT, the NYS ELA test and the ELL Data Analysis Tool.

How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.      a. Science, Technology and Research School currently has six identified ELL students.  We would continue the use of  the shared instruction free standing model with heavy collaboration between the ENL teacher from the shared  instruction school and the teachers and administrative cabinet from the home school. In short,  the ENL teacher  would work with ENL students during content instruction in collaboration with the classroom teachers to provide  acquisition and vocabulary support while retaining content instruction time.      b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?               The two ELL students at STAR fall into the  Transitioning, Expanding, and Commanding category. These students are  programmed for one ELA class and one integrated ENL/Social Studies class per day, five times a week.           3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.        Content Areas in the Self-Contained Model:   The shared instruction ENL teacher would use a range of instructional methods to ensure that students are building  comprehension across all content areas along with linguistic knowledge, development, and performance in English. All units  are thematic-based and designed around an essential question. The essential question is then explored and developed through  all genres of literature, including fiction, content-area texts, informational readings, poetry, historical non-fiction, and drama.  In addition, ENL texts and teacher-generated ENL lessons are utilized to teach English across all content areas. Instruction  would be  differentiated to meet the needs of the ENL learners. Classroom libraries would be equipped with glossaries and\or  dictionaries reflective of the home language of the ENL students.       By meeting with content area teachers by grade level and by subject area, the ENL teacher learns which material needs  scaffolding support in the ENL class and suggests differentiation and scaffolding that can be put in place by the content teacher  in order to provide the ENL students with access to the content curriculum. Finally, as mentioned before, there would be  continual collaboration between the ENL teacher and the content area teachers in an effort to provide seamless support for  acquisition of knowledge for the ENL students. Teacher Team meeting times will be embedded into the programmatic  structure to allow for collaboration between ENL and content area teachers.           4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   All content at STAR would be delivered in English. Some support in Spanish and/or French is given in the ENL classroom. The  ENL teacher does not speak Arabic, Nepalese, or Russian so English is the mode of communication in the ENL classroom as  well.   Whenever possible, staff members who may speak other language are utilized to support instruction. At STAR we  currently have staff members who speak Spanish, French, Creole and Russian.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status      a. Instructional plan for SIFE: Educational interventions would be written and implemented for all SIFE at STAR. The  interventions are based on student data acquired through both formal and informal assessments in ENL and the content areas,  as communicated by the student's teachers in each subject area. The student's strengths are drawn upon to plan motivation  curriculum and to design differentiated means of assessment that will both challenge the student and also allow him or her to  experience academic success.  The ENL teacher's lessons will introduce and build upon the fundamental skills and knowledge  required for full academic participation and success across the curriculum. In addition, SIFE are given the resource of extra  tutoring both during and after school.  b. Instructional plan for newcomers: Newcomers participate in our Balanced Literacy Program at STAR. Many newcomers test  as beginners on the LAB-R, so they receive two 45-minute periods five times a week. Intermediates receive two such periods,  and advanced, one period of ENL and one forty-five minute period of ELA. In ENL class, the teacher models reading  comprehension strategies, vocabulary building strategies, phonics, and writing practice in mini-lessons which are followed by  group, paired, and individual student practice. Whenever possible, art and music are integrated into the lessons in order to  reach all student levels of comprehension and knowledge and to allow for differentiated assessment.  c. Instructional plan for ENL's receiving 4-6 years of ENL service:  Students receiving 4-6 years of ENL service are identified by the ENL teacher, content area teachers, and guidance counselors  using the available student data reports. The teachers and counselors meet to discuss the student's current academic track  record and potential graduation date. In addition, most of these ENL's attend after school in order to meet  the academic  graduation requirements.  d. Instructional plan for long-term ENL's: In order to help long-term ENL's meet graduation requirements and achieve  academic success, after-school classes are offered for the content area courses, such as history, English, and science. Students  and their parents are informed both in writing and verbally about the programs available to them that will help them prepare  for Regents exams. All long-term ENL's are encouraged to attend the program offerings by their ENL and content area  teachers. Furthermore, like the 4-6-year ENL's, these students are tracked and discussed on a monthly basis by their ENL  teacher, content area teachers, and guidance counselors.  e. Instructional plan for ENL's identified as having special needs: Eligible ENL's who are identified as having special needs  receive a paraprofessional who provides daily academic assistance. Various scaffolding techniques are regularly implemented  to help these students achieve academic excellence. Lessons are created by the ENL teacher and content area teachers that  target both the student's strengths  to build upon and their areas of weakness. ENL's having special needs are included in all  aspects of our school, including our ENL classes.       To prepare ENL students for the ELA, there is a great emphasis on reading and writing and there is coordination between  the ENL teacher and the ELA teachers to provide support and reinforcement of material being covered in the ELA classroom.  There is reading and writing across the entire curriculum at STAR. Instruction is also differentiated to meet the need of the ENL  student.     The plan for all ENL's, regardless of their time in ENL, is to provide academically rigorous material that will give students  language development opportunities, reinforce content, and provide reading and writing across the curriculum with the goal  of passing their Regents and other exams.          6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?    Both the ENL and content area teachers implement a variety of instructional strategies, resources and programs designed for  this particular group of students.  Within every lesson, delivery of instruction and the student product for assessment are  differentiated as appropriate using visual aids, computer programs, modeling, and student choice.  The school ensures ENL- SWDs whose IEP mandates bilingual instruction receive an appropriate program through scheduled meetings with the ENL  teacher, IEP distributions and notifications and regular communication on each student's progress     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68         7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Teacher will be made aware of any student that meets this criteria.  Scaffolding techniques will be  used to help them achieve  academic excellence.  Lessons that target their strengths as well as their weaknesses are utilized to help them become  proficient in English.  They are included in all aspects of our school as well as in our ENL classes.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  There are six students who meet this criteria. Teachers in the content area meet regularly in teacher teams and discuss,  collaborate, integrate and develop scaffolded plans to meet the academic targets of ENL students and ELL SWD students. As  mentioned earlier, dialogue between the shared instruction ENL teacher and the content area teacher (s) is used to further  support both language acquisition and overall academic progress.        9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      We already have information with respect to new  (to our school) students. The current program meets the needs of these  students. Therefore, the current program will be re-implemented.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A        11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.    All students are offered and afforded access to all available programs (including clubs, sporting teams, leadership committee,  after school class and regents prep, etc.) at STAR. Many of the activities are offered campus-wide due to the fact that there are  five schools on the Erasmus Campus. Therefore, the numerous activities are communicated to all students via flyers, letters  home (in home language), and daily announcements. All teachers at STAR are highly supportive of students' participation in  extra-curricular activities and serve as an advocate for these students to participate when talking to both parents and coaches.  The ELL student at STAR all participate in all schoolwide programs including House Challenge and grade level activities (parties,  etc.). Finally, At STAR we currently have staff members who speak Spanish, French, Creole and Russian. We utilize staff  members whenever possible.        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  All classes at STAR have leveled libraries and instructional material that is differentiated to meet the varied needs of all  students including ELL's and SWD.        13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?     Native language support is delivered in the self-contained/integrated ENL model. The ENL students at STAR are fluent English  speakers but they are provided dictionaries if needed or wanted. Brooklyn College tutors are alerted to the special needs of  theses students and assist when necessary.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.   After initial evaluations, various tests are used to determine appropriate level support. Some of these include: Criterion  Referenced Tests, Online Language Assessments and teacher made tests.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69         All classes at STAR have leveled libraries and instructional material that is differentiated to meet the varied needs of all  students including ENL's and SWD. STAR will collaborate with two other schools on the campus (AOHT and ACPCE) in order to  meet the need of ENL students. Resources and personnel will be utilized to provide seamless instruction for students.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).     Early in the school year, the Guidance Counselor teachers contacts ENL's and their parents/guardians.  This initial contact is  attempted in order to welcome new students and their families to the school; to introduce themselves, to answer any  questions they may have; to notify them of upcoming school events, such as new student orientation; and to inform them of  available services, such as translation services.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Spanish and French would be offered if the students are  in High School.      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The professional development programs are based on the belief that all teachers are teachers of language arts and that English  as a Second Language is a natural extension of English language arts. The teachers who are directly involved with the teaching  of ENL students are given Professional Development in differentiating instruction to meet the varied needs of the students  (including but not limited to ENL students) in the classroom. They are also invited to attend Professional Development  opportunities offered off site with respect to the meeting the specific needs of the ENL student population.   The information  acquired at these workshops is then shared with all other teachers at collaborative teacher team meetings.The majority of ENL  professional development occurs more informally during Monday meetings and common planning time. Professional  consultancies with expert knowledge on the specific demographic are invited to conduct workshops during the weekly Monday  afternoon meetings.    See above        2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  All new teacher in the 6  th   and 9  th    grade  receive professional development at the beginning of the year on aiding  incoming students with the transition process to middle school and high school. This is particularly important and effective for  working with ENL's, as it suggests that more scaffolding, repetition, and modeling may be required for these students as they  become acclimated to the high school environment. As mentioned earlier, later on in the year experts in the field are invited to  STAR to hold workshops for all teachers.     All teachers who teach ENL's are trained in the Balanced Literacy workshop model.  They teach the students reading and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70         writing strategies in every lesson.  Subject area teachers are introduced to textbooks that are at the reading levels of  ENL's.  Teachers learn effective methods of teaching ENL's new vocabulary words.  Teachers of humanities work cooperatively  to create an interdisciplinary curriculum for ENL's.  Thus, the reading and writing strategies that students are learning in  history, foreign language, and English classes are reinforced.  Science and math teachers also work cooperatively to create an  interdisciplinary curriculum.  In addition, teachers learn about the students’ cultures at professional development workshops  centered on Culturally Relevant Pedagogy.  This knowledge is used by teachers to better communicate with newcomers and  build connections on a human level. Records of staff professional development, including Monday meeting small groups PDs,  are kept on file by both department and grade-level teams.        Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?    Parents of ENL students are called in for meetings twice a semester.  Also, communication is delivered to those parents  through our phone messenger and PupilPath platforms. Both of these platforms have the ability to translate written dialogue  into a host of languages.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Parents of all students are invited to participate in a host of activities at STAR including but not limited to House Challenge  activities, talent competitions, spelling bees, parent association meetings, etc. Staff members at STAR have the ability to  communicate in English, Spanish, Russian, French and French Creole. These staff members are utilized when needed to  disseminate information to parents about a list of topics including school based functions they may attend and/ or participate  in. Once, again the school has two online communication platforms that are used to disseminate pertinent information to  parents. Both platforms have the ability to translate information into a number of languages.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Dr. Eric L. Blake, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   STAR Early College School                                                                              School DBN: 17K543  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      There are two main types of translation needs at our school:     a. Written: Documents - birth certificates, transcripts, health records, court documents etc.   These documents  are translated by school staff fluent in the language whenever necessary. In cases of transcripts where the  amount of credits and subject area is often not clear, documents are faxed to approved NYCDOE Translation and  Interpretation Unit for processing. Major school related documents (Blue cards, discipline codes) can be found  printed in numerous languages.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74      b. Oral: Spoken translation for non-English speaking adults and students. Science, Technology & Research have  accessible staff who speak Spanish, Russian, French and Haitian Creole.
