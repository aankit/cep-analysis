This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Bronx Little School’s Mission Statement    Section 4: CEP Overview      Bronx Little School is committed to creating a nurturing community of learners; an environment where students,  parents and staff collaborate to promote the individual interest, strengths, and creativity of each student. Our mission  is to teach respect for self and others in a multicultural campus. We strive for both academic excellence and the  development of leaders for a caring world community.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    In keeping with our mission statement, we have made strategic decisions when formulating class models. On every  grade level we have one Integrated Co-Teaching class. We have an ENL provider as well as SETTS and AIS providers  who all use a combination of push-in / pull out models of instruction. We also have a whole school AIS program in  which all students received small group targeted literacy instruction for 35 minutes daily.    Bronx Little School has a full-time Drama teacher. We offer a theater program for our students in grades 2-5, in which  they participate in an after school musical. Through the collaboration of our classroom teachers and our arts teachers,  students learn the connection between the arts and literacy, math, social studies, science and technology. We have  established a relationship with Dancing classrooms, in which our 4th and 5th graders take ballroom dancing. Through  Studio in the School we are able to provide art classes to our students. Second grade students partake in the Swim for  Life program in which they attend weekly swimming classes. LEAP provides us with teaching artist and our students  take part in an entrepreneurship club, multicultural dance, pre-robotics, legos, and art classes. Our mobile (laptop)  technology lab, IPads in the classrooms, and our electronic smart boards in every classroom provide all children, from  Pre-K through Grade 5, opportunities to use technology as a tool for learning; all of our ICT classes have 2 smart  boards to facilitate alternative and parallel teaching. Our goal is for students to understand that technology, like  books and pencils and paper, offers a path to knowledge requiring active learning behaviors that support critical and  creative thinking.    Our campus partnerships with Kids Creative and Roads to Success provide after school activities (academic, social,  physical) for students K-5 in addition to a summer camp program. Bronx Little School, in partnership with the NY  Roadrunners has instituted a Young Runners program that meets three times a week after school and Saturday  mornings. Our young runners often attend weekend meets and have had opportunities to meet accomplished  marathon runners from around the world. We also provide students with opportunities to be a part of our various  enrichment clubs, such as: math club, student counsel, basketball club, and our newspaper club.    Bronx Little School is co-located with 12x536 and 12x531. All three schools house students in grades Pre-K through 5.  At Bronx Little School, we believe that our students’ success is attributable, in part, to the fact that each child is  known by all staff members, that all children know one another, and that our staff and parents value collaboration.  We pride ourselves on our strong sense of community and commitment to a common goal, student achievement.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Over the years, our school population has grown from 96 students to 320 students. As we have grown, so has our  population of students with disabilities, from 0% to 23%. The growing Bengali immigrant population in the nearby  Park Chester community is reflected in our student demographics. We are experiencing an increasing number of  students who are English Language Learners (about 25%) with Arabic, Bengali, or Spanish as their first language. Our  Title I status has remained constant and our percentage of Hispanic students at about 60%.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Based on the learning environment survey, we have been able to consistently demonstrate in progress in the past 3  years, in trust we went from 3.28 to 4.23, in effective school leadership we went from 4.32 to 4.67 and in rigorous  instruction we went from 3.34 to 4.40, in 2018. Our goal is to continue to demonstrate improvements in student  proficiency in ELA.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 12X691   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   298   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  Strengths:   Based on the learning environment survey, in the area of supportive environment we demonstrated the greatest  gains from 2017 to 2018 with an increase from 1.68 to 4.11. This is our 4th year using The Leader in Me philosophy to  develop leadership qualities in staff, students, and families. We are continuing to develop our ICT class models where  students with disabilities receive daily instruction with peers and all adults are actively providing targeted instruction.  Our ENL, AIS, and SETTS teachers all use a combination of push-in/pull-out models of instruction to meet students'  needs but also assist students by creating supports in the classroom.   We have continued our partnership with Kids Creative and Roads to Success provide after school activities (academic,  social and physical) in addition to a summer camp program and last year we also partnered with LEAP to provide after  school enrichment activities. Through LEAP we are able to offer theater, various dance classes, an entrepeneurship  club, art, legos, and pre-robotics with talented teaching artist.    We also continue to offer programs that educate the whole child such as: Young Runners (partnership with the NY  Roadrunners), Riverbank State Park (Swim for Life), Studio in a school for Art, and Dancing Classrooms in which our  students learn ballroom dancing.    Our teachers also host after school or lunch time clubs that include: student counsel, the math club, basketball, Green  team, lanyard making, French Club,and our school newspaper.    Priority Need:   Although students say they enjoying coming to school and they know the importance of attendance, student  attendance and tardiness continue to be an issue for our students. We continue to have issues with chronically absent  students and excess lateness. Our annual attendance has held steady at 94%.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Verify with an (X)   Column B   Section Reference(s)  Section 5a, 5b, 5c.  5d; and section 6         Section 5a, 5c. 5d;  and section 6         Section 5a, 5b, 5c.  5d; and section 6      Title I Part A (Basic)   Federal   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Federal   Federal   Title III, Immigrant   Federal   Tax Levy (FSF)   Local   277,717.00      0      12,366.00      0    2,241,796.00      x      X      x      X      x        1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37     conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Bronx Little School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the  Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      Bronx Little School will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   ● Providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level (e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology).   ● Providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children.   ● Fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress.   ● Providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments.   ● Sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      ● Providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community.      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association, as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on the  proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input. To increase and  improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before October 31st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      ● schedule additional parent meetings during the Tuesday Parent Engagement Time or daily Preps to share  information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and allow parents to  provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help      The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference in September;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.      School-Parent Compact (SPC)   School-Parent Compact (SPC)   Bronx Little School in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is  implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between  the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I,  agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for  improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure  that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

In 2015, 100% of our ENL students were  level 1. In the math state exam from 2017, 15.4% of English Language Learners in grades 3-5  scored proficient (a level 3 or 4).  In 2017, the number of students that were level 1 decreased  from 72.7% to 5737%.     Based on the 2017 NYSESLAT, students also demonstrated improvements. In first grade, 4 of  the 7 students  serviced moved up 1 performance level and 2 of the students that stayed as  "entering" had an increase of 30 points. In second grade, 7 of the 11 students moved performance  levels; with 3 students moving up 1 level and 1 student moving up 2 levels. In third grade, 8 of  the 9 students demonstrated improvements with 6 students moving up 1 level and 1 student  moving up 2 levels. In fourth grade, all students demonstrated improvement with 8 students  moving up 1 level and 1 student moving up 2 levels. In fifth grade 4 of the 6 students  demonstrated improvements with 3 students moving up 1 level of performance and  1 student moving up 2 levels.      In order to meet the needs of all students and ensure the acquisition of academic English needed  to reach their academic English learning objectives and show proficiency in both state ELA and  Math exams, the school will offer various programs.  There will be a dedicated ENL teacher to  work with students from K to 5th grades. The teacher will be balancing pulling out and pushing  into classrooms.    This year we will also have our targeted after school programs for 7 weeks beginning on October  2018 through April 2019 from 2:30pm to 4:00pm, On Wednesdays and Thursdays. The language  of instruction will be English with students grouped according to both NYSESLAT levels and  content proficiency.   Staffing will consist of 4 New York State common branch certified  teachers, dependent on student participation, with 1 certified ENL service provider. The ENL  teacher will work with the teachers for planning of instruction.  During instructional periods the  ENL teacher will work with 2 teachers, co-teaching/pulling small groups for 45 minutes in each  class. During the push in time, the common branch teacher should be focusing on ELA  specifically, since this is an area of greater need for the students.      Many of our ELL students struggle with vocabulary, especially within context.  Our Saturday  program will begin in February and will last for 6 sessions, lasting about 3 hours.  Staffing will  consist of 4 new York State common branch teachers and 1 certified ENL service provider. The  ENL teacher will follow the same instructional delivery approach as described in the after school  program. Within the six session, ELL students and their families will experience various trips  throughout the city and be immersed in language development through experiences. Although  we are providing various workshops and opportunities within the school, this program aims to  help the whole family develop language acquisition through experiences.   Some of the  experiences include: trips to a museum, a cooking class, a and a fishing trip.  The program is  being coordinated by the ENL coordinator and the teachers.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46            Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   All records are maintained by the ENL coordinator and are arranged by student grade levels in  binders.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  To assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs, various assessment tools such as Fountas & Pinell Benchmark Assessment, ELL  Periodic Assessments,  pre- and post writing assessments aligned to The Teacher's College Reading and Writing project's  curriculum assessments are implemented to monitor student progress and determine needs that should be addressed.     According to the results of the Fountas and Pinnell Reading Assessment, those ELL students who are entering Grade 1 at or  below Level A in reading are offered the following intervention services:                                      * After school extended day intervention with their classroom teacher or other qualified  staff                                           members                                   * Wilson Phonics intervention Program                                    *Fountas and Pinnell Literacy Intervention Program   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51                                       *Center time activities focusing on ELL student's academic and linguistic needs      ENL English language arts instruction is differentiated through the use of a variety of materials including, Reader’s Theater, The  Language Power Program, The New Comers Program by Pearson, Finish line New York ELLs Books, leveled books ( Mondo,  Houghton Mifflin, Mantra Lingua and Pacific Learning), big books, charts, songs, books on CDs, and computer software.  In  addition, our ELL students enjoy a reader’s theater program to help them with reading fluency and vocabulary  enrichment.  The ENL teacher supplements and differentiates math for our ELL students by creating lessons and activities that  include language objectives and math content objectives.  Math, science and social studies books are available in Spanish to  address the needs of our Spanish dominant students.  In addition, a multi- language lending library is available with the  assistance of our ENL teachers, so our Spanish, Bengali, Urdu, and Arabic-speaking parents can read with children at home in  their native language.              2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The ENL teacher keeps track of students running records, pre and post unit assessments, and monitor students growth  throughout all four modalities.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  According to data from the NYSESLAT assessment the trend at our school is that ELL students enrolled at our school since  kindergarten are reaching a proficiency level in the target language English in a period of 2-3 years.  This trend has been  consistent for the past 6-7 years.     In all grades, we use the NYC performance tasks to measure growth in math and in ELA we use a combination of F&P and the  performance tasks.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once the summative data has been gathered both ENL teachers work together to place students in their appropriate groups  according to their levels. Incoming students are provided instruction using the New Comers program and Wilson  Fundation Program. For students not making adequate gains, we also use our AIS and intervention teachers to provide further  support.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   At Bronx Little School we understand the importance of early identification of at-risk ELL students and the need for evidence- based interventions.  For this reason, our ELL students are carefully and regularly monitored using data from formal and  informal assessments such as standardized State Exams (ELA, Math State Exam, Science State Exam), NYSESLAT Assessment,  Fountas and Pinnell running records, Baseline, pre-unit and post-unit writing assessments, and end-of-unit math assessments.  We also print out the EDAT every few months to check the status of incoming students and their level of performance based  on their previous school.  In addition, Fountas & Pinnell literacy benchmark data informs targeted follow-up instruction  through the use of small group intervention. Unit assessments found in the New Comers Program, Finish Line New York ELLs,  The Language Power Program, measures our ELL students' development of their academic language in the 4 modalities  (listening, speaking, reading, and writing).     Careful analysis of data collected from the above mentioned assessments is used to target student academic needs and to  facilitate individualized instructional decisions based on those needs.  Consequently, TIER I and TIER II interventions are  recommended and put in place by an RTI team consisting of the Principal, Special Education Classroom Teacher, ENL teacher,  Speech Therapist, guidance counselor, and an AIS specialist.  Tier I interventions include guided reading, differentiation in  small group setting during math, science, and literacy activities, Fountas and Pinnell Phonics Lessons and interactive use of  technology. Tier II interventions include Fountas and Pinnell Literacy Intervention Program and Wilson Program implemented   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52         by a qualified AIS specialist.      Most importantly, to help our at-risk ELL students reach common core learning standards, sheltered instruction methodologies  are implemented in TIER I and TIER II  settings using the SIOP model delivery system.  SIOP practices include:                             *Content and Language objectives clearly defined for ELL students K-5 (TIER II setting)                             *Content concepts appropriate for age and educational background level of students                             *Supplementary materials used to provide a wide-range of entry points for student learning (e.g., visuals,  manipulative, modified text, native language glossaries, vocabulary notebooks, realia, etc.)                             *Meaningful activities aligned to common core learning  standards with language practice opportunities in  listening, speaking, reading, and writing      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   According to the results of the NYSESLAT of Spring 2016 (ELL students Grades 1-5), none of our ELL students are at the  commanding level, 13 students are at the expanding level, 8 are at the transitioning level, 5 students are emerging and 5 are at  the entering stage of English language development. Based on the changes from 2015 and 2016, 4 students made growth, 7  remained the same, and 2 regressed. From 2015 to 2016 there was also an increase in the number ELLs at Bronx Little School.      Based on the common Core Aligned English Language Arts, we had 68.4% of students that were level 1 and 31.6% of student at  a level 2.  An decrease of level 1s  from 100% in 2015 and 75% level 1s in 2016.  In the math state exams 15.4% of English  Language Learners in grades 3-5 scored proficient.  The level students who scored a 1 in mathematics also decreased from  72.7% to 57.7%.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   We work with our data specialist to track student data.  Throughout the units we use our Assessment Analysis Protocol (APP)  to determine student progress throughout the units and make adjustments as necessary. These changes are evident in our  critical learning paths that are modified version of the units we use for instruction.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   In order to meet the mandates of CR part 154.2 and.3 as well as provide quality instruction to our ESL students we  offer a combination of both push in and pull out services.  Students are enrolled in a variety of general education  classes.  Students are serviced through a combination of push in and pull out classes by proficiency level. Entering and  emerging are seen 8 times per week. 4 times in a homogeneous group of beginners and low intermediate. The  remaining 4 times instruction is provided with high intermediate and advanced students in either ELA or content area  class.     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     n/a   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      n/a      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              Our ELL students are provided with their corresponding minutes of instruction per week that integrates literacy and  content area instruction aligned to the common core learning standards.  ENL students receive the following minutes of  services: Entering = 360 minutes per week, emerging = 360 minutes per week, transitioning = 180 minutes per week,  expanding = 180 minutes per week, and former ells will continue getting serviced for 2 more years at a minimum of 90 minutes  per week.  Social Studies, math, and science concepts are integrated with language instruction and balanced literacy  components (Read-Alouds, Shared Reading, Guided Reading, Minilessons, Reading Workshop, and Writing  Workshop).  Literacy and content-area Social Studies are always combined with the curricula required of the grade level.  This  integration of instruction which is often delivered to our ELLs in Thematic Units of study gives our ELLs multiple opportunities  to learn and use the academic language, develop content-area knowledge , and increase their literacy skills.  Our ELLs students  participate in collaborative group work.  The groups consist of ELLs with students of various proficiency levels which makes it  possible for our ELL students to support each other linguistically.  Accountable talk is always encouraged during group  activities in order to help our students to strengthen their academic language.  During this academic discourse, our ELLs have a  variety of resources available such as content area word walls,  charts,  graphs, realia, and other visual aids to scaffold their  language development.  The Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP) is used as a model for all instruction. The units  of study in our school curriculum include guidelines for differentiating instruction for ELLs as described in The RTI Daily  Planning Book K-6 by Gretchen Owocki.       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.       Our focus this year is to deliver content area instruction to allow multiple points of access to the content through text,  visuals, scaffolded supports, and talk: Rather than providing modified content we provide enhanced content. Students will be  exposed to concepts through multiple modalities. Students will be provided with explicit instruction in how to develop an  argument to support their idea using text evidence. This protocol will be repeated throughout the content areas to provide  consistent strategies and repeated practice. Additionally, students are seated heterogeneously during classroom instruction to  facilitate discussion using peer models.   Throughout the year we will provide professional development to all of our teachers  so that in our content area classrooms, ELLs will be provided with language supports such as sentence starters and the  opportunity to have discussion with direct teacher feedback in the moment. In addition to direct collaboration with content  area teachers, our ESL teacher, Ms. Maldonado will provide support in developing background knowledge through read- alouds, use of multimedia for content explanation and pre-work to prepare for classroom discussions. Students will use native  language supports such as texts in their native language, connection of content area vocabulary to native language vocabulary,  and conversations in native language to prepare to discuss in English.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      ELL students are evaluated in their native language using the Spanish version of Fontus and Pinnel reading assessment, which  is a performance assessment designed to help teachers measure and monitor the literacy development of Spanish speaking  students K-5.  Writing samples and end of unit math assessments are also given to newcomer ELLs in their L1 Spanish and  evaluated by the ESL teacher who is Spanish speaking.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    We review the data from the NYSESLAT to determine baselines for performance in the four modalities. As the four modalities  are an integral part of the Common Core Standards they are a crucial part of our ESL and Content Area curriculum. In our ESL   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      and content area curriculum, there are planned assessments in the four modalities for each unit. Our ESL providers, Ms.  Maldonado will work together along with the literacy coach to develop and use a speaking and listening rubric aligned to the  Common Core State Standards to assess all classroom talk.  In addition, we use Fountas and Pinnell running records in order to  measure reading development.   Classroom writing will be assessed on pre and post rubric based writing assessments as part  of classroom units,projects, summative and formative assessments. Currently there are no SIFE students at Bronx Little School,  but an individual intervention plan will be developed for any SIFE student if the need arises in the future.  Our extended day  program provided addition support to students on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:20 - 3:00.  The purpose is to provide our  ELLs with additional English language instruction in the content areas and literacy in order to help them strengthen their  academic language and help them perform at the level of their English proficient peers.  In addition, our newcomer ELLs are  encouraged to use their native language as a bridge towards the transition into English.  These students are encouraged to  read and write in their native languages during ESL instruction and when they are in their regular classroom settings.  Our  newcomers and their parents are also provided with lending library books in their native language (Spanish or Bengali)  to encourage literacy at home.  ELLs who require extended ESL services (ELLs receiving services 4-6+ yrs)  are closely  monitored and provided with extended day instruction to further support their academic and language development.  An AIS  support teacher provides extra support to ELL students with IEPs.  Extended day instruction is provided for these students. All  ELL student groups previously mentioned are encouraged to participate in our Saturday ELL Academy Program including  proficient ELL students.           6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   The instructional strategies and grade-level materials used by teachers of ELL-Students With Disabilities that provide access to  academic content areas and accelerate English language development are the following:             *Small group instruction that provides ELL students for sufficient opportunities to use academic language             *Graphic organizers (i.e., KIP graphic organizer for content words)             *Vocabulary development (academic vocabulary notebook/binder using methodologies from John Marzano)             *TIER I/RTI highly affective instruction             *Leveled books for independent reading             *Text that is modified and adapted to grade level             *SMART Boards with grade appropriate technology             *TPR (Total Physical Response)             *Content area word walls             *Tony Sted's, Explorations in Nonfiction Writing (ELL support section grades K-5)  The ESL teacher also provides professional development and has created a resource binder with supports for classrooms  teachers.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?   In order to help diverse ELL-SWDs achieve their IEP goals and attain English proficiency within the least restrictive  environments flexibility in curriculum, instruction, and scheduling is used as follows: intervention specialists and the ESL  teacher visit ELL students with disabilities through - out the week to support said students during content instruction in order  to help these students meet common core learning standards.  ESL methodologies are implemented during these push - in  sessions while teaching academic content in a small group setting in the classroom.         8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Bronx Little school provides interventions in Math and ELA through after school and Saturday programs. Teachers also use  various strategies and small group supports to meet all students needs. During after school tutoring, our ELLs receive small  group reading instruction that includes additional independent reading time, individual comprehension conferences, writing  about reading using text evidence, and daily rubric based teacher feedback about reading and writing. Our ELLs also will   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      receive after school enrichment for math which includes use of test preparation materials and a routines bank of skills based  problems of focus. Work for after school enrichment is selected based on student assessments. All ELLs are eligible for after  school enrichment based on test scores and teacher nomination. In our classrooms, ELLs are targeted for weekly small group  instruction in ELA, Math, Science, and Social Studies based on teacher data. Saturday Academy is focused on developing math  and literacy skills in alignment with the Common Core State Standards. All ELLs are eligible based on test scores and teacher  nomination. All of these intervention services are in addition to the curriculum embedded supports already in place for ELLs.  Bronx Little School's targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other content areas are:              *The Wilson Phonics Program - Special Education ELL students              * Fountas and Pinnell Literacy Intervention Program - ELLs with IEPs, ELLs receiving services 3-6 years              * Literacy Intervention Teacher - Proficient ELL students              * Saturday Academy for ELLs (Grades 1-5) - Math using common core learning standards/SIOP Methodology     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      We are working with teachers and the parent coordinator to create a parent and student ESL class during the weekends in  which families would partake in learning opportunities through experiences around the NYC.        10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We are continuing with all of the programs that were in place last year.  Discontinuance is not a factor for our school  currently.      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELL students (present and former ELLS)  are encouraged to participate in all after school programs, including sports  activities.  Letters are sent home to parents in their home language inviting their child to join.  Saturday Academy for ELL  students, which includes an adult ESL class for families of ELLs,  has resulted in high participation by ELL students and parents.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  ESL English language arts instruction is differentiated through the use of a variety of materials including On Our Way to English  Program, Reader’s Theater, leveled books ( Mondo, Houghton Mifflin, and Pacific Learning), big books, charts, songs, books on  CDs, and computer software.  In addition, our ELL students enjoy a reader’s theater program to help them with reading fluency  and vocabulary enrichment.  These materials are available to meet the needs and differentiate learning for our students.  Also,  dual-language books are available in Spanish/English and Bengali/English to address the needs of the Spanish and Bengali  dominant students and to support literacy learning at home.  A Spanish language lending library is available with the assistance  of our parent coordinator and student council, so our Spanish-speaking parents can read with children at home in their native  language.        13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   We have texts and dictionaries available for students in their native language in several content areas. All teachers are  provided with content relevant glossaries to use with students in their classrooms. Additionally, ELLs have access to iPads,  which provide a variety of options for providing instruction in native language.  We are currently working to purchases Apps  for ENL students.  We also have purchased bi-lingual guided reading books to support our ENL receive small group  instruction.            14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    At Bronx Little School ELL students participating in the ESL program are grouped according to grade and heterogeneously  according to language proficiencies.  ESL instruction delivered corresponds to each grade's core learning standards, ELA  Standards and ESL standards.  The On Our Way to English Program is also delivered to our ELLs according to grade.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56         ESL English language arts instruction is differentiated through the use of a variety of materials including On Our Way to English  Program, Reader’s Theater, leveled books ( Mondo, Houghton Mifflin, and Pacific Learning), big books, charts, songs, books on  CDs, and computer software.  In addition, our ELL students enjoy a reader’s theater program to help them with reading fluency  and vocabulary enrichment.  These materials are available to meet the needs and differentiate learning for our students.  Also,  dual-language books are available in Spanish/English and Bengali/English to address the needs of the Spanish and Bengali  dominant students and to support literacy learning at home.  A Spanish language lending library is available with the assistance  of our parent coordinator and student council, so our Spanish-speaking parents can read with children at home in their native  language.        16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   New ELLs at Bronx Little School are given a tour of the school and are taught survival language skills upon arrival.  The  classroom teacher is given  a Survival Language Tool Kit which she uses to communicate with her newcomer ELL student.  Our  newcomer ELL students are also provided with modified homework and books in their native language for independent  reading.  These students are also given a partner (most likely a proficient ELL who speaks the newcomer's first language).  Our  ELL students are encouraged to participate in our Saturday Academy for ELLs program in which newcomer ELLs receive  Specialized ESL instruction to help them become familiar with  the new culture and to develop the basic survival language  needed in the target language- English.       17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Language electives are not currently offered at Bronx Little School.         18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.

Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Bronx Little School teachers are supported in learning ESL strategies through ongoing professional development as follows:  -The ESL Teacher/Coordinator attends workshops in ESL methodology and best practices throughout the school year and  shares information with classroom teachers and other staff members working with ELL students.   -Teachers of our ELL students receive at least ten hours of instruction in ESL methodology.   -Teachers are provided opportunities to attend professional development off-site, including workshops for best practices to  meet the needs of our ELL students through the Bronx Borough Support Center.  -Of our scheduled monthly three-hour professional development sessions throughout the year, two are devoted to informing  best practice for ELL instruction through SIOP methodologies.  -Periodic emails that describe best practice and research-based strategies for ELLs are sent to all teachers.    -Articulation meetings take place throughout the school year where our ESL teacher and our classroom teachers exchange  ideas and share best practices.    -We are working with Teacher's college that provided both professional development day at Colombia and in house at  BLS.  Both provide teachers with opportunities to develop skills to meet all students needs.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57         -Our teacher resource center contains professional books and journals on the topic of teaching English Language Learners in  the regular classroom.   -All paraprofessionals, coaches, and the guidance counselor are included in the trainings and also have targeted opportunities  to meet their needs.    The ENL teacher, Ms. Maldonado is attending a series of Professional developments around Teacher's College, specifically for  ENL teachers.  Ms. Maldonado also received content based professional development along side classroom teachers. She  attends common planning meetings with teacher teams to help teachers infuse ENL strategies into all Ms. Maldonado has also  worked to attend other professional development opportunities through the Bronx Borough Support Center and through the  Office of ELLs as well as other professional organizations.      2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  The guidance counselor and parent coordinator both work with students and families to ensure students attend multiple  middle school fairs before selecting their final decision.  Through our informational session we provide information to both  students and families in their home language about the offerings from the individual school choices.  The guidance counselor  and the fifth grade teachers also work together to create opportunities for students to discuss and ask questions about going  to middle school.  Students are also a part of the Leader in Me program in which they learn the 7 habits of successful children  to help them deal with life situations.  Using the 7 habits fifth grade teachers work with students to ensure they are prepared  for the challenges of changing schools.       Our ENL coordinator works with the math and literacy coach to develop ongoing curriculum and lesson modification plans.  As  a team they work to provide differentiated professional learning opportunities across content areas to teachers during  common planning times an professional development days. As teachers attend these meetings, records of there work is  documented in our professional development calendar.        Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   A team of staff members that includes the ESL teacher, Principal, Parent Coordinator, and a classroom teacher work  collaboratively to plan and improve instruction for our ELL students.  The ESL teacher and the Parent Coordinator work closely  together to ensure that parent letters and notifications are available in the languages represented in our school (currently  Spanish, Arabic, and Bengali).  We also have staff that communicates with families in English, Spanish, and Bengali.  For other  languages we use translations services.     At Bronx Little School parents of ELL students are always encouraged to visit our school and to participate in ongoing parent  activities throughout the school year presented by our parent coordinator.  Such workshops include topics such as: nutrition,  fun literacy activities to do with their children at home, Family Math Night, etc.   Interpreters are always available to help  parents feel comfortable and welcome.  The parent coordinator and principal both speak Spanish and translate all  conversations, while one of the fifth grade teachers speaks Bengali and works with these families to translate.  When  individuals are not available we work with the phone translation services.            2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Parents of ELL students are invited to various events throughout the school year, including: Breakfasts with the principal,  student performances, conferences with teachers, workshops with the parent coordinator, and parents of various ELL students  are a part of the school community through our Learning Leaders program, the School Leadership team, and the parent   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         association.  Both the parent coordinator and the principal translate all communication in both English and Spanish, BLS also  uses a fifth grade teacher when possible to translate to Bengali.  When these option are not available, the school uses the DOE  translation services.         Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.    Answer to section C question 2 under parent involvement:  Agendas and sign in sheets are used at all meetings.  All meetings with  families are logged on our school family outreach log and documented on the students yellow cumulative file, which include dates  of all meetings.  Meetings can be held during school hours, during the parent engagement time, or before and after school.  Although we prefer in person meetings, we will also hold phone conferences with this is the only method available to  parents.  Mailed or backpacked correspondence is also used to send notifications to families. Families are always provided  communication in their home language, with through the use of staff members who speak the home language or through the DOE  translation services.                            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Bronx Little School                                                                              School DBN: 12x691  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Upon arrival into our building, the HLIS (Home Language Identification Survey, is given to the parents in the home  language spoken. In most cases, pedagogues who speak the majority languages (Spanish, Bengali) in our building  are used for translation support to our parents. At the entrance to BLS we have bulletin boards with all parent  information in all home languages. During the ELL Parent Information Sessions, all materials given are translated  into the necessary languages. Furthermore our teachers are invited to sit and assist parents in any way possible.  When necessary, we also use the DOE translation services and google translate.           2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community.

Our Bengali and  Arabic families  prefer written  notices in both  English and  their home  language.    Most of our parents speak  English with Spanish the second  most common first language.       Most  communication  is sent home in  English to these  families with  the expectation  of DOE  materials  already  provided in  other  languages. ENL  program  specific  information is  also sent home  in Bengali.    When sending  written  communication  home to  families 75% of  documents are  provided in  Spanish.    Of the  documents  sent home, all  documents  provided by  the DOE in  various  languages are  sent in home  language and  of school  documents  20% are sent in  home  languages,  other than  Spanish.    About 50% of  our families  prefer a  language other  than English.  50% of our staff  can  communicate  with our  Spanish  speaking  families and we  have a staff  member that  also speaks  Benagli. For  families that  speak other  languages we  use translation  services.    About 50% of our families prefer a  language other than English. 50%  of our staff can communicate with  our Spanish speaking families and  we have a staff member that also  speaks Benagli.
