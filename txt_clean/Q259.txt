This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Section 4: CEP Overview            Our Mission: Pathways College Preparatory School (PCPS) is a community that educates the mind, body and soul of  each of our students in preparation for entrance and success in college and careers. We view college and career  opportunity and success as a "pathway" to excellence and equity in life. Through our partnerships with families,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      community organizations, businesses and universities, including Adelphi University, Farmingdale College, PAL, Sport  and Arts Foundation and Achieve Now, we seek out real world learning experiences for students to enhance their  skills and knowledge. As a result, graduates from PCPS will be able to use their experiences to think critically about  personal, political, and professional responsibility and the impact of their choices on their lives, community and the  world at large. Our school community integrates three core values into the work that we do each and every day:  Respect, Responsibility, and Resilience.       Our Vision: Pathways College Preparatory school will be a pathway for students into college and career. Our students  will engage in a learning environment where they are empowered with information about their own development.  We will have a culture that celebrates students’ social, emotional and academic development while holding them  accountable for their contributions to individual and collective achievement.         2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   Pathways College Preparatory School (PCPS) is an early college secondary school with approximately 600 students in  grades six through twelve. We are co-located with Renaissance Middle School in St. Albans, Queens which is a  predominantly African American/Caribbean community. Pathways is 13 years old and is a part of the south-east  Queens community. We have multiple families who send all of the their children to Pathways. We believe is "seven  years, one family, mission possible." We stress to our parents, our strongest academic students are those who are  with us for seven years. Our commitment is Pathways will be the pathway to college and career.   Through our partnerships with families, community organizations, businesses and universities, including Adelphi  University, Farmingdale College, Police Athletic League, Sports and Arts Foundation, NY Foundling and Achieve Now,  we seek out real world learning experiences for students to enhance their skills and knowledge. Through our Smart  Scholars Early College grant, we provide students with early college courses and the opportunity to earn up to 24  college credits by the time they graduate . Many of our students who are with us for seven years chose us because of  the opportunity to earn college credit and attend classes on college campuses while in high school. In addition, we are  partnered with several of the DOE's Equity and Access initiatives: AP for All, Algebra for All, College Access for All for  both our middle and high school. We also participate on Middle School Quality Initiative (MSQI) which focuses on  literacy across the content areas in our middle school. MSQI provides an instructional coach and several student- centered literacy based opportunities such as MSQI Debate team. These initiatives help us offer a rigorous and  equitable experience to all students.    We are committed to a strong school culture (mind, body, soul) and Pathways is one of twenty-two schools citywide  to implement a full Restorative Justice (RJ) program from grades 6 -12. Our RJ Curriculum is facilitated through our  Advisory. We have a full-time Restorative Justice coordinator and a full-time social worker through this grant. Last  year we received a wellness grant and now have a Wellness Center staffed with a full time social worker for students  and families through our partnership with NY Foundling. Our NY Foundling Social worker can do home visits and  counsel student and families. We now have full Wellness Team at Pathways.             3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Pathways College Preparatory School is a secondary school with approximately 600 students from grades 6 through  12. The school population comprises 84% Black, 5% Hispanic, 1% White, and 8% Asian students. The student body  includes 4% English language learners and 15% special education students. Boys account for 51% of the students  enrolled and girls account for 49%. The average attendance rate for 2017-18 for high school was 91% and for middle  school was 95.3%. Our special needs population at the middle school level requires the most attention. We had  2017 -2018 proficiency rates of 45% in ELA and 25% in Math. Although we have a small ELL population, we have  students who will need additional support.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over the past year:    We have made improvements in creating a supportive environment, effective school leadership, collaborative  teachers, strong family community ties, and trust. With the support of our SSOPE Restorative Justice program we  have reduced our school incidents by over 50%. Based on the school quality survey and we exceed in the area of  effective school leadership. Pathways is a community going into its third year of transition. 95% of of our ninth grade  early college students earned six college credits. We increased the amount of early college credits earned across  grades 9 - 12. We retained 77% of eighth grade students in our high school. In 2016 the retention rate was 40%. 62%  of our eighth grade students passed the Algebra Regents and have entered high school at Algebra 2 leading to a  college math four-year sequence. In addition to english, math and history early college courses, we now offer college  courses in Life Guarding and Physical Education. We had 2017 -2018 proficiency rates of 45% in ELA and 25% in Math.  We improved our graduation rate 3% to 69%.    We are in our second year of participation in the following programs: Middle School Quality Initiative, AP for All,  Restorative Justice (SSOPE), Algebra for All, and MS College Access for All and Smart Scholars Early College Grant.

Teachers will engage in critically reflecting on their teaching practices and  assessments to ensure that all learners are engaged in appropriately rigorous tasks that create opportunities for  students and staff to demonstrate higher-order thinking and skills in their work (i.e. class discussions, student work  products, problem-solving, curricula, course syllabi, unit plans, rubrics, etc.).   Based of the Framework for Great Schools we will focus on the following areas:   ● Improve pedagogy across classrooms by ensuring high quality questioning, rigorous tasks, and multiple entry points  that consistently provide all students with opportunities to engage in student discussions that maximize learning   ● Ensure that all teachers use common assessments both (formative and summative) to effectively adjust curricula  and instruction that meets the learning needs of all students in order to increase student proficiency demonstrated  on state exams.     Utilize school-wide data systems to drive instruction and improve student performance on state assessments,   graduation rate and college readiness.   ● Strengthen Common Core content to ensure curricula that challenge students to develop higher order thinking skills  through rigorous academic tasks and activities that promote college and career readiness.      Strengthen student writing, student-to-student discourse making their thinking observable and focusing on  higher order thinking.  Increase parental involvement focused on student achievement.       Maintain and improve school-wide sustainable systems and structures based on all areas of focus.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 29Q259   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08,09,10,11,1 2   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   583   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     Pathways’ strengths relative to rigorous instruction:     Teacher teams and professional development is focused on data driven instruction and student engagment.    Our school has a plan for assessment and engagement which lead to rigorous instruction. Teacher teams are  using Effective Teacher Team Harvard Instuitute guidelines and will be using IO Assesment as a universal tool  for analyzing student data.      We have maintained new Peer Collaborative Teachers to support teachers and teacher teams with planning   for assessment, engagement and rigorous instruction.      Some of our needs in this area:   ● 2017 -18 PPO: We are developing in 1.1, 1.2 and 2.2 .   1.  Teacher planning for rigorous and engaging instruction and assessment is our focus  2.  Using data to drive instruction and planning through our vertical teams in service to improving student   performance on state assessments.   3.  CCLS Unit Plans/Lesson plans need to be developed/revised based on student data  4.  ELL and SWDs supports need to be built in – SWD credit accumulation and regents is lower compared to other   students.   Student work from the units does not always match the intended outcomes of the grade level and/or subject  standards.   The priority need identified by the school related to the Capacity Framework element of rigorous instruction is to  strengthen teacher practices that challenge students to develop higher order thinking skills through rigorous  academic tasks and activities that promote college and career readiness.   2018 -2019 Problem of Practice: Data indicates that students are under-performing on state assessments compared  to course performance data. Administrative feedback has identified that course demands (classroom and work  products) are not rigorous enough to adequately prepare students for success on state assessments and beyond. Staff  members are struggling to successfully increase the rigor in their classrooms while providing the support to students  needed for them to be successful. In order to address this problem, we are engaging in a variety of professional   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14      development and vertical team processes focused on creating rigorous work for students while also promoting  student engagement.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42        Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Pathways College Preparatory School: A college Board School, in compliance  with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and  implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement  between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving  them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to  actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained  volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Pathways College Preparatory School: A college Board School will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability  grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report,  Learning Environment Survey Report;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between /teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?   The Spanish LAB-R and teacher created assessments are used to assess the early literacy skills of ELLs. When possible various  staff members fluent in reading and writing of other languages are used to facilitate in depth interviews with the students.  Students previous educational records are also reviewed by staff members who may be familiar with the schools or school  systems in the various countries our students are from. The RLAT data shows that the students struggle with writing and  reading, so  the school has implemented a reading program for those students. Other programs are in place for accelerated  ELL students. They are also supported with after school tutoring in their prospective content areas.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The ENL/ESL teacher, Co-teachers and Co-plans with the ELA vertical team as well as provides push in services for the Social  Studies and Mathematics classrooms. The school is looking to increase our supports by providing after school supports for the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52         students SIFE students through grants and other funding sources that would help the school to leverage academic  achievement.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  This is measured based on the growth plan in our CEP. We collect the data from the NYSESLAT as a baseline at the beginning of  each year. ELL students are also part of all whole school interim assessments such as EdPerformance and other measures used  in the school. Comparisons are made to the previous years and measure growth of each individual student is attained and a  plan is created encompassing language objective goals for each student that will promote further growth in all modalities and  content areas. As the responses are measured, lessons and goals are adjusted to add scaffolding or other interventions are  deemed necessary and they are provided.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Comparisons are made to the previous years and measure growth of each individual student is attained and a plan is  created encompassing language objective goals for each student that will promote further growth in all modalities and content  areas. During Vertical and Grade Teams Data is reviewed and Lessons are revised to incorporate the results of the data.  As the  responses are measured, lessons and goals are adjusted to add scaffolding or other interventions are deemed necessary and  they are provided.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   For first time admits to the NYCDOE schools system, the ENL/ESL teacher administers the intake interview and helps the  parent complete the HLIS. Based on the responses to the HLIS the students are identified if needing to test using the NYSITELL.  They are then tested by the ENL/ESL teacher and placed according to their score. The students who fall into the ELL group are  then serviced during the year by the ENL/ESL teacher and tested during the year with the field tests, teacher made exams, oral  and written presentation and the NYSESLAT. The ENL/ESL teacher also reviews the records of the students newly admitted to  the school to ensure that commanding students are identified for continued service according to the CR-PART 154.    The ENL/ESL teacher is constantly monitoring the new admits to the school to ensure that new students who are eligible are  identified and tested with the 10 days designated for that purpose. At the beginning of each year reports (RLER & RLAT) are  run by the ENL/ESL teacher to identify the incoming ELL roster. Those students are placed accordingly and the appropriate  letters from the OELL are sent home.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The NYSITELL results indicate whether a student may have had some level of English training in their homeland before entering  the NYC DOE.  The NYSESLAT is an indicator of where the student is at the end of the year as an ENL. It speaks to the growth and progress of  said student in implementing, learned, and transferring vocabulary and skills from their native language to English. These  results also reinforce the statistics that language is acquired via speaking and listening followed by reading and writing.  The lack of success in these exams may indicate students with interrupted formal education as well as be an indicator of  students that have advance skills sets that will promote achievement through the ENL/ESL program.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Staff is provided with a list of current and former ELLs and their levels. The ENL/ESL teacher disseminates the data  during vertical and grade team meetings. The data is used to align the Language standards with the content curricula. The  ESL/ENL teacher also Co-plans with the ELA vertical team as well as the 12 grade Mathematics Teacher. During this time  individual student data from all assessments are reviewed and adjustment are made to lessons and unit plans to ensure  multiple points of entry for all students. Targets of Measurement for ELL students are reviewed and language objectives are  embedded into th lessons.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53           Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   The ENL/ESL teacher, Co-teachers and Co-plans with the ELA vertical team as well as provides push in services for the  Social Studies and Mathematics classrooms. The ENL/ESL teacher also provides StandAlone ENL/ESL services for the  remainder of the time to ensure the services mandates are meant.

Entering and Emerging ELL are placed in classes for ELA and  Mathematics that are co-taught by both general education content certified teacher and a certified ESL teacher for a minimum  of 180 minutes for MS and 360 minutes for HS. Additionally 180 minutes per week of services are provided in a small  classroom separate location during the school day for the HS students based on level.  Transitioning and Expanding ELL students receive 180 minutes of ESL services through a combination of push-in classroom  support in ELA, Mathematics and Social studies that are co-taught by both general education content certified teachers and a  certified ESL teacher.  The commanding ELL student receives 90 minutes of ESL/ENL services per week   with a licensed ESL teacher in a co-teaching  by certified content teachers and an ESL teacher.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Core content is delivered through the push-in model. students are emerged in the core content classes. the ENL/ESL teacher  provides language objectives and monitors the targets of measurements.  Scaffolding is provided along with language  dictionaries and glossaries. At times when available translated materials are provided to ensure that skills and strategies  taught in class are understood and progress towards mastery is attainable.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   The students receive their content teacher designed exams in the language available through the translation unit if exams  can't be translated in house. The students are given the summative evaluations in both English and their native language  (where applicable) other language require a translator to do a word to word translation during the uniform exam times and  dates (ie.. Regents and/or state exams).     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      SIFE     a.  b.

They are also provided push-in service that foster emergence in the content classrooms.  through the push-in model they are provided with scaffolding and multiple entry points that help to promote their language  objectives.  Our long term ELLs are those previously X-Coded (SWD's who were deemed exempt due to  language processing delays and  not language acquisition) are provided services through the push-in model and extra support during after school and  Saturday academy. These same students are also provided after school regents preparation class to ensure success in the  regents exams and graduation.       6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Students are provided with the reading material in translation where available. They are also given the reading materials on  lower lexile levels but same content as a way to differentiate the work based on student ability and performance level. Some  teachers utilize achieve 3000, Newsela as well as other possible resources to achieve this task.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  The school uses a combination of push-in and pull-out ENL services to ensure that all students are being reached in all  contents. The school has built in co-planning time for the ENL and Special Education teachers to work with colleagues to  ensure that multiple entry point s are available for all students and multiple modes of assessments are used to provide and  opportunity for all intelligences to shine.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Based on the school data, we find that a reading program was needed for our SIFE students in order to augment their reading,  decoding, phoninic awareness  and comprehension skills. So for this, we have implemented the MaxScholar reading program  with our ENL students. Our Middle school ENL students are also Part of the Middle School Quality Initiative (MSQI).  We also offer Saturday academy for all students to improve their ELA/Literacy and math skills. All programs are offered in  English with language supports for our staff or tech programs.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?     For the upcoming year we will continue with the Maxscholar Program, Summer OnBoarding, Saturday academy and  Restorative Justice.

Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   The ENL/ESL teacher contact the parents throughout the year during the parent engagement time and the outreach is logged  into skedula. Parents are contacted on a regular bases. The ENL/ESL teacher communicates with the Spanish and Haitian  Creole speaking parents without a translator since she is fluent in those languages. other content teacher are used to  communicate in Bengali and Arabic with some of the other parents and newcomers.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Parents of newly admitted ELL students at Pathways are given an initial interview with the principal, the assistant principal  assigned to the grade, the ESL coordinator and a translator. At this interview the parent is presented with the video which  explains the three choices of Language programs. The parent then completes the Parent Survey and the Program Selection  form. The student is placed in the appropriate ESL class within 10 days of enrollment, based on the parent selection form and  the student's LABR score. At the current time no parent has requested a program other than the freestanding English as a  Second Language Program.  At the start of each year the ESL teacher reaches out the current ELL parents with the appropriate letters from the OELL site,  informing parents of the program choices and their child's eligibility to receive services . The parents are informed that while  currently, we offer a freestanding ESL program, we will open up a bilingual program when we have the appropriate number  (15 students within 2 consecutive grades in MS and 20 students in the HS) of parent requests, as per CR Part 154.

Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.
