The motivation driving this work is our commitment to providing every child with a school that  meets their academic and social-emotional needs. Closely accompanying this imperative is our belief that every school  can be renewed and foster a community based culture of learning. The job of the district is to use our position to  provide the systemic vision, strategies, and resources to facilitate school renewal through a collaborative effort including  all stakeholders.     The core values held as essential for the success of the School Renewal Program:     A “learning stance” must be held by all community members (district leaders, school leaders, school staff,   community-based partners, students and families). The work should be approached with humility and integrity.  We must all be willing learners.     A “theory of action” must guide the work to ensure clarity and coherence.    Authentic teams that collaborate in the spirit of trust, within and across the various levels of the school   community, are prerequisites for successful school renewal     Schools will be places of robust engagement, anchored in positive youth development, ensuring that the school   environment is welcoming and empowering for students, families and community members.     Strong professional development/learning is a fundamental part of our work.    The school renewal implementation must be simultaneously dynamic and responsive as well as sustained over   the three year period of renewal.     The organizing Theory of Action that guides the School Renewal Program strategy:   By using the Six Elements of the Framework for Great schools as our improvement structure, we seek to align  instructional coaching and leadership development with structural supports in order to build staff capacity.   Using schools  instructional foci, school leaders  and staff will implement changes  in curriculum,  instruction,  school  culture  and  structures  so  that  there  are  sustainable  improvements  in  student  outcomes  and  school  culture.     The arc of the School Renewal Program strategy:  In order to attain high levels of achievement for all students in Renewal  schools we must build capacity to increase  student achievement through the adoption of new attitudes and behaviors, research based strategies that improve  teacher practice, coupled with the use of clear data driven supports for building students’ skills in the content areas and  increasing student engagement. We are particularly prioritizing reading and writing across the curricula.  The use of  student learning data will drive instruction through strong teacher teams; onsite, job embedded professional learning  and problem solving, and accountability at all levels of the system:  central, district and school - for results. Renewal  schools are provided with intensive training, leadership and pedagogical coaching, and structural supports, monitoring  of implementation and ongoing feedback and revisions as needed. Further, each Renewal school will become a  Community School and strategically partner with community based organizations (CBO) to integrate social services and  expanded learning time into the fabric of the school to help them better serve the needs of students.  These schools will  stand as centers of opportunities where families can get the supports they need to make sure students come to school  ready and able to learn.    School Receivership    In April 2015, state lawmakers and Governor Andrew Cuomo created section 211-f of the State Education Law, which  established the School Receivership program as a new intervention strategy to turn around struggling schools. This new  law, and Commissioner’s regulation 100.19, requires that “Persistently Struggling Schools,” defined as Priority Schools  that have been in the most severe accountability status since the 2006-07 school year, be given an initial one or two- year period under a “Superintendent Receiver”.  These schools were placed in receivership under the New York City  Schools Chancellor. Each school must make demonstrable improvement on specific benchmarks or it will be placed  under an independent receiver. Under the Chancellor’s Receivership Plan, the School Renewal Program is NYCDOE’s   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      5     core strategy for turning around struggling schools. Renewal Schools have already begun implementing significant  interventions and are receiving additional resources and support to accelerate student performance and help close  achievement gaps reflected in this RSCEP.    Structure of the Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP)   The Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP) will serve as the organizing and overarching document for  each Renewal school and will be directly aligned and developed around the elements of the Framework for Great  Schools, New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, and Strong Schools,  Strong Communities, including the following:     Demonstrable Improvement Benchmarks: Demonstrable improvement benchmarks located in the 2018-19   RSCEP, in the Data and Accountability Snapshot page.  Receivership benchmarks have been closely aligned with  the Renewal benchmarks so that schools will have one coherent set of improvement benchmarks to meet.  All  Receivership Benchmarks are a subset of Renewal Benchmarks. While the targets for these overlapping  benchmarks are not always identical, the Receivership Benchmark targets are always equal to or lower that the  Renewal Benchmarks targets. That means that any school that meets its Renewal Benchmarks targets have by  definition also met its Receivership Benchmarks targets. For additional information on Receivership  demonstrable improvement benchmarks go here.      Establishing an overarching summative vision aligned with elements of the Framework for Great Schools and   documenting key areas of celebration and renewal through analysis of assessments and by envisioning what the  desired outcome for each school will be at the end of the School Renewal process.      Setting interim assessment benchmarks that create the path for improvement by focusing on desired outcomes   and goals. In this way, the plan will be mapped to the overarching summative vision. In addition to the five  discrete goals formed around the elements of the Framework for Great Schools, each school will create an  action plan.     Transformation into a community school in order to increase student and family access to physical and mental   health services and other social-emotional supports made available in or near the school.     Expanded learning opportunities for all students, including additional instruction provided during afterschool      and/or summer programming provided in collaboration with community partners.  Intensive professional development for all staff to ensure effective implementation of curriculum and  instruction aligned to the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and to support staff in effectively responding  to the differentiated academic and social-emotional needs of all students.    Additional, focused strategies to increase parent and family engagement.      Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Information on the Framework for Great Schools and the DTSDE   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      6     The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and RSCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive  Educational Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for  continuous improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing  review and analysis of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement  activities and strategies that improve outcomes for students.       Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.       The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      7     School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:   1.  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity  2.  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions  3.  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support  4.  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions  5.  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and  6.  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement    NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   I.  Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:         It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the RSCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the RSCEP.

Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Create a summative vision for the elements of the Framework for Great Schools.     Step 5: Revisit your school’s current goals, and strategically create new goals informed by the needs   assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART – Specific,  Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you monitor  progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you have identified, and will let your school  community know when you have reached your goal.       Step 6: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 7: Update your school’s AIS section. Title I schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement   Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 8: Complete the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) and the Community School sections.     Step 9: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether strategies and activities outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust practices along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      9      Section 3: Community Engagement Team and School Leadership Team (SLT) Signature Page      Directions: All SLT members are expected to sign this page to confirm their participation in the development of this  Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP).

Summarize the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) opportunities that have been offered to your students this year.   A school with “A Passion For Excellence,” MS 328 fosters an environment in which diverse learners can bridge the  divide between childhood and adolescence, achieving full potential in their academic, creative, personal, physical, and  moral development. Our beliefs about student learning is captured in our school’s mission statement, “With our  minds, with our hearts, with our hands we seek to inspire and empower every child to pursue excellence with  passion.” We believe that children learn best when there is a high degree of challenge coupled with a high degree of  support. Our pedagogy is characterized by high expectations, sustained academic rigor, and quality teacher-to- student and student-to-student interactions. Our instructional focus is rooted in the belief that if teachers plan for  and support student collaboration and opportunities to build understanding\meaning together, then students will be  able to achieve at standards-based learning tasks independently. As a school community we look for and measure the  evidence of student learning in deeply sustaining learning tasks that require thoughtful critical thinking. This effort is  best captured in student writing that undergoes the writing process from drafting and note-taking to a final,  publishable piece. We will track the development of our students thinking, and deep understanding in their writing  and measure this growth comparatively from September 2018 to June 2019.   Our teachers have been trained to implement Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP) and Quality Teaching  for English Language Learners (QTEL) so that they are better prepared to meet the learning demands of a learning  community whose Ell students comprised more than one quarter. Every teacher uses both language and content  objectives in their daily lesson plans in order to support all learners along the continuum of language acquisition. We  believe that all students are in a process of acquiring proficient academic language that will propel them toward  college and career readiness in the real world, and therefore design instruction to include access points and  acceleration for all learners.    New Millennium Business Academy (09X328) is a small, community middle school located in the Morrisania section of  the Bronx. As a neighborhood zone school, students are matched to our school from 22 neighboring elementary  schools. The neighborhood is mostly residential, African American, Puerto Rican, and Dominican. Roughly 20 percent  of our students abide in temporary housing.   During the 2017-2018 school year, the student body of MS 328 was comprised of approximately 26% English  Language Learners and 24% Students with Special Needs. 60% of the student body is Hispanic, 36% Black, 1% Asian,  and 2% White. The school shares a campus with two additional middle schools, J.H.S 145 and MS 325 and collectively  the campus schools participate in a universal free-lunch program.    The school has partnerships with several community-based organizations, including The DreamYard Project,  GlobalWrites, Project Boost, Hip-Hop 4 Life, St. Barnabas Hospital, Lehman College, Monroe College. MS 328’s lead  CBO for the 2018-2019 school year will be the Center for Supportive Schools. The school celebrates it’s partnership  with DreamYard particularly for it’s annual poetry exchange program with schools in Tokyo, Japan.

During the 2014-15 school year the  event was attended by Mayor Bill D’Blasio.   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      13      The Center for Supportive Schools will play a key role in the renewal school process as the school transitions to  becoming part of a community school campus and re branding it’s namesake. Working in Tandem with several  community partners including Monroe College, Lehman College, and several local and corporate businesses the  school will provide experiential learning opportunities that inspire all students to not only pursue academic  excellence, but also to pursue ingenuity and entrepreneurship as a personal brand. We strive to create a community  of learners and leaders.    To encourage teacher tenure and commitment to the school’s mission and vision, the school will continue to support  structures for teacher leadership. During the 2018-19 the school intends to retain three teacher leadership roles and  add a four: Three Peer-Collaborative Teachers and one model teacher who will work closely with the school’s  administration to provide ongoing, job-embedded professional development and mentoring. Through a two year  District 9 initiative, two of our peer collaborative teachers were extensively trained by the New Teacher Center to  mentor, support, and professionally develop first and second year teachers. During the 2018-2019, our Peer  Collaborative Teachers will continue to be integral members of the school instructional cabinet.       This year, we showed strength in the Collaborative Teachers element of “The Framework for Great Schools” when we  used our Monday professional development periods to execute lesson studies around the school’s instructional focus  --quality interactions. Through six lesson studies, our teachers studied instructional strategies designed to produce  “quality interactions” amongst learners. Working together teachers collaborated to plan and deliver lessons and  observed one anothers practice. Teachers consistently and openly discussed lesson strategies and student work using  common student work analysis protocols. They also monitored student benchmark data and gave each other  actionable feedback. Our priority professional goals for this upcoming school year are threefold:      1. Further develop teacher teams to be viable teams that work within structures of a professional learning community  as defined by Solution Tree.    2. As a Data Wise model school, we will improve already existing Inquiry team structures to ensure a cycle of  continuous learning for all students.    3. We will continue to deepen teacher understanding and practice in Domain 3 of the Danielson framework- which is  closely aligned to our instructional focus, Quality Interactions, through our partnership with Harvard University via  Teacher Rounds.       We will continue working toward ensuring rigorous instruction across all classrooms by strengthening teacher  collaboration to design and implement viable curricula in all core and elective courses. We will ensure that curricula is  aligned to Common Core and provides an appropriate level of rigor and support across classrooms and grade levels by  placing an emphasis on writing across the curriculum. Working in partnership with Literacy Design Collaborative  (LDCI3) our school will develop all content area teachers in the area of assigning and scoring standards-based learning  tasks using a common rubric. Students will write a minimum of 6 science lab reports, 6 writing projects in social  studies and a minimum of 20 (proficient) math extended response writing assignments. In ELA, students will complete  a minimum of 8 writing projects per school year. Our goal is that each student will have a student work binder that  will comprise of a minimum of 25 writing pieces that show learning growth by the end of the school year.    Historically, we have offered a variety of Expanded Learning opportunities for our students. For those in need of  remediation, we have offered Saturday Academy and after-school tutoring/enrichment through our 21 st Century   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      14         grant as well as our regularly scheduled renewal school after school program. In addition, through our National Junior  Honor Society charter, we will continue to offer Math and ELA enrichment for our honor students.         2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      15         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 09X328   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   242   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

The school will continue to protect time and structures for teachers to develop unit and lesson plans that are  appropriately aligned to the CCLS and NYS content standards and address student achievement needs. The school’s  strengths in this area include     Our 2017-2018 School Quality Review received five Well-Developed in the following areas:    o  1.2 Teacher Pedagogy     1.3 Strategic Organizational Decision    1.4 Culture of Mutual Trust    4.1 Teacher Professional Development    4.2 Professional Collaboration    Among the five areas of proficiency under the School Quality Review, we will focus on   highlighted lines for improvement.   o  1.1 Rigorous Instruction Across All Content Areas  o  2.2 Ongoing Assessment          o  3.1 Coherent Vision of Improvement         o  3.4 Culture of High Expectations         2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      18      o  5.1 System for Monitoring and Making Adjustments   ∙ Structured time to meet in grade level and content areas teams (3.3)   ∙ New Staff Mentorship and support (3.3)   ∙ Collaborative lesson planning and lesson studies (3.3, 3.4)   ∙ Deep analysis of student work in order to drive decisions made in curriculum modifications (3.4,3.5)   Although the school was rated Developing in all aspects of this tenet the school will continue to build upon the following  strengths in order to address each sub-tent by:   ∙ Developing a shared instructional focus around quality interactions so that all learners will have access to content that  is rigorous, comprehensible and includes access points for all learners (3.2)   ∙ Provide weekly job-embedded professional development around school’s instructional focus (3.2)   ∙ Teacher teams in all core content areas will set benchmark checks to ensure that instruction is data-driven (3.4, 3.5)   ∙ Teacher teams will analyze student achievement data beginning in October with baseline and ongoing through June  2019. (3.5)   ∙ Teacher teams will used common rubrics and protocols for analyzing student work in order to determine student  progress and student goals toward standards-based learning tasks ( 3.5)           Part 2 – Summative Vision for Rigorous Instruction   What is your school’s instructional focus? What is your vision for promoting the instructional focus consistently across  classrooms?       By the end of the renewal school process the school will have a tried and proven approach to standards-based  mathematics instruction. Our math teachers will implement a curriculum aligned to the CCLS using Glencoe Common  Core Edition textbook and EngageNY. The math department will focus on problem solving (across grades) with an  emphasis in ratios and proportions (6 th ), proportional relationships (7 th ), and functions/expressions & equations (8 th ).  Baseline and benchmark assessments will be used at beginning and end of each instructional unit to track student  progress and determine intervention needs.   English Language Arts teachers will collaborate to develop a curriculum that utilizes resources from the Teacher’s  College Writing Units and Expeditionary Learning. The ELA department will also continue to develop practices around  American Reading Company’s 100 Book Challenge program to foster independent reading and differentiation during  literacy block. Baseline writing and interim benchmark writing assessments will be used to track student progress.  Teachers will work together to analyze student writing, and set learning goals.   Students at MS 328 are expected to read independently (at minimum) 30 minutes in class and 45 minutes at home each  day. During the school day, teachers will conference with students and collect data from their conferences in the  literator database. This system allows us to provide targeted, individualized next steps for each student. We will use  Literator to determine AIS and differentiate Expanded Learning Time. We will also deepen our use of iready during our  Expanded Learning Time, four days weekly. Students will be program for alternating A-B days during which we will   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      19      dedicate 75 minutes for iready mathematics differentiated support and 75 minutes for ELA(A days). On alternating B  days targeted students will receive RTI supports for which they have been matched based upon our baseline  assessment, or attend one of six enrichment courses offered at the same time . This will allow us to reduce our RTI  classes to no more than 15 students per targeted intervention.   Science and social studies teachers will continue to implement the CCLS writing standards within their content areas.  There will be a minimum of one CCLS aligned writing assignment per unit of study in science and social studies. In  addition we will continue our full implementation PBI science and Passport Social studies, matched to the NYCDOE  curricula for social studies and science and State standards   All core classes will have the following structure:   ∙ Independent Reading (ELA only)   ∙ Connection   ∙ Model   ∙ Shared Experience   ∙ Guided Practice   ∙ Collaboration   ∙ Independent Practice (Small-Group Instruction)   ∙ Closure   All teachers will be trained in order to build their capacity to plan coherent instruction that effectively provides access  points for all learners, including ENL’s. With careful attention to the acquisition of academic language, all lesson plans  will include both language and content objectives that are measurable, observable and standards-based. Teachers will  use sentence stems and accountable talk protocols to promote academic conversation and interaction in the classroom.   The school will continue to use quarterly writing benchmarks to track student progress. Data from unit assessments will  be uploaded into   steps for our students. This tool will also help us to determine what scaffolds and differentiation techniques are  necessary to push our students to mastery of the CCLS across content areas.   Resources for ELT:   The school will be prepared to provide extended learning opportunities for 100 percent of its students. Our academic  and enrichment program is outline later in the plan, however the following is a list of resources we will use to support  our Extended Learning Time programs:   ∙ myON, a digital independent reading program that measures student reading level progress ongoing.   ∙ DreamYard (Studio Art, Poetry, Chorus, Theater, Step), an arts enrichment CBO with whom the school has partnered  for the past nine years.   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      20      ∙ LEAP - Learning through an Expanded Arts Program, a CBO comprised of ELA, STEM, and enrichment teaching artist  who will service up to 40 students during ELT.   ∙ Book Club   ∙ Community Service Projects (NJHS), through their participation in the national Junior Honor Society, students will  engage in three-four community service learning activities.   ∙ Mock Trial, select students will practice and compete in the annual Borough-wide mock trial competitions.             What is your vision for the implementation of CCLS-aligned curricula that meets the needs of your diverse learners,  personally, academically, and culturally?   Our implementation of CCLS-aligned curricula will meet the needs of diverse learners personally, academically, and  culturally.          What is your vision for diverse program offerings that allow students to develop skills, habits, and behaviors to be  career and college ready? How are instructional shifts embedded in this vision?  Through partnership with our Community School’s CBO, Center for Supportive Schools, and their subcontractors,  students will have the opportunity to participate in social/emotional, ELA, math, STEM, athletics, and arts enrichment  programs that will offer students a broad set of opportunities to apply the skills gained during traditional classroom  instruction in the core academic subject areas. Program examples include Peer Group Connection, an evidenced based  social/emotional and leadership development program partnering 8th grade peer leaders with the entire 6th grade  student body; LEAP “Power Hour” (ELT) and afterschool programming focused on ELA, arts enrichment, robotics, 3D  printing, photography, dance/step, athletics, etc.; Salvadori Center who focuses on a STEM approach to learning about  the built environment through project based learning, and Success Mentoring focusing on attendance and positive  academic goals setting.      Instructional shifts are embedded in this vision through regular bi-weekly or monthly teacher team meetings with all  program providers to align classroom instruction and program instruction to specifically meet the needs of identified  groups of learners.         What do you envision the delivery of instruction to look like so that all students are set up for success?   The delivery of instruction will include culturally relevant curricula and resources that engage learners personally,  academically and culturally.          How do you envision teachers using multiple entry points to ensure the success of every child?  Teachers will engage students through multiple entry points including the use of scaffolds to support ELLs and SWDs.          What is your vision for the use of a comprehensive assessment strategy (diagnostic, formative, benchmark, and  summative) to drive curricular, instructional, and organizational decisions that impact student outcomes?   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      21      The school will continue to use diagnostic, formative and benchmark assessments to track impact beginning in  September when all students will take diagnostic reading, ELA, Mathematics and writing baseline assessments.

Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement  planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal.  Similar to your Annual Goal, your mid-point benchmark should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and  Time-bound.  We will use iReady to use measure benchmark data, midyear data, and end of year data. We expect that by February,  2019 there will be a minimum of 15% increase in students scoring Level ‘3’ or higher on end of unit benchmarks  anchored to Teachers College writing rubrics.       Student Achievement: The school will carefully monitor student progress in the four content areas through  baseline and interim assessments. Using already existing structures to evaluate students writing, the school will  monitor and carefully track student achievement toward meeting and exceeding common core learning standards.  Every student will complete writing-on-demand baselines in mathematics, ELA , social studies and science. The  results of these baselines will be used to set instructional goals that are time bound. Teachers will communicate  learning goals clearly for students and families and celebrate student achievement along the continuum of the  school year. Every student will complete a minimum total of 24 writing pieces for the school year. Their writing  work will be organized into a portfolio that will be carefully reviewed with their families at three parent-teacher  conferences.      Our tool for assessing learning progress will be our students’ writing. The school will closely analyze and monitor  student progress by looking at standards-based student work regularly using designated data protocols. In order to  monitor the successful achievement of this goal, the following are a list of benchmarks beginning with baselines  assessments    September – October   · Reading leveling (ELA only) September -- October    · Baseline assessments: (math, ELA, social studies, and science) – September – October   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      32      · Midline (1): December, 2018   · Midline (2): February, 2019   · Midline (3) April, 2019   · Endline: June 2019      Teacher Development:    The school will carefully monitor teacher professional development beginning with teacher goal-setting  conferences in September. Teachers will review their MOTP progress from the previous year, set new goals and  timelines for completion. Teacher progress toward their goals will be monitored through through regular  observation and feedback aligned to the Danielson Framework, mid-year goal-monitoring conferences, and end of  year summative reviews. Teachers will be provided weekly ongoing professional development support through our  already-existing structures for PD: We will continue to devote the bulk of our learning time together to  collaborative lesson studies – a process that includes lesson planning together, intervisitation and providing low- stakes feedback and support to one another’s instructional practices and impact as measured through deep  analysis of student work outcomes.       The School will closely monitor teacher development, providing the following supports and interim checks,  beginning with teacher goal setting conferences:    Supports & Checks:    · Peer Collaborative teachers   · Weekly professional development    · Lesson studies and classroom inter-visitations    · Data-monitoring meetings September, December, February, April, June.    · Grade level team meetings --September 2018—June, 2019   · Content-area team meetings, September 2018—June, 2019   · Teacher Goal setting conferences, including Teacher Improvement Plans (TIP) – September – October, 2018   · Classrooms observations September 2018 – June 2019   · Teacher mid-point checks – February – March, 2019   · Teacher End-Of-Year-Conferences – June, 2019     Part 6b.

What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  5.  What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide,   Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review?      All school stakeholders will work together to develop a common understanding of the importance of their contributions  in creating a school community that is safe, conducive to learning, and fostering of a sense of ownership for providing  social and emotional developmental health supports tied to the school’s vision that is focused on attention to whole  child. As a small learning community, the school prides itself on knowing every child extremely well, including  sometimes personal family information. The fact that the schools was rated developing in all sub-tenets, is an indication  that the work that school does must become more transparent. Therefore, during the the 2017-18 school year the  school will focus it’s work to establish clear structures to support the following:      · The school will continue to build upon systems and structures to address the needs of the whole child including  building upon local partnerships to provide guidance and intervention programs onsite (5.2)    · Because 100 percent of our students qualify for free\reduced lunch and approximately 20 percent of the school’s  population resides in temporary housing, the school will continue to provide health support services for students to  recive eye and dental screenings at least once annually onsite(5.2)   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      35      · Through a partnership with the Center for Supportive Schools (CSS) the school will provide ongoing peer-student  mentorship program, Peer Group Connection (PGC) around school culture principles/expectations in order to foster a  supportive learning environment (5.3)   · The school will continue to refine it’s PBIS structures in order to ensure student ownership and full participation in a  positive school culture (5.5)   · Priority Needs   Maintain the daily attendance average at or above the 91.5%, as indicated as a benchmark goal for the school.    Decrease the chronic absentee average by 5%. for targeted         Part 2 – Summative Vision for Supportive Environment   What is your vision for a supportive school environment? How will you in partnership with each CBO and families  enact your vision?     MS 328 will continue to build upon its Student Government Association (SGA) structure where students are selected to  represent the voices of their homerooms through student held elections. Representatives will be advised and mentored  by the school’s dean and trained to facilitate regularly scheduled student council meetings with the Dean and school  administration. Through this venue students will be provided the opportunity to provide input on school-based  decisions and shine a light on any pressing student concerns, thereby teaching them the real-world value of responsible  citizenship. During the 2017-18 school year, the school will be more proactive in promoting improved student social and  emotional skills by better utilizing the student government. The SGA members will become ambassadors of the school’s  social and emotional message. In the future the SGA will select and carry out theme-based weeks that address issues  like bullying, peer influence, drug prevention, academic pressure, etc. Beyond creating posters the SGA will create PSA  announcements that are played at morning assemblies and highlight the message they are trying to send out to the  student body. These look like student act outs, or multi-media projects that carry a positive social message. By having  students who are selected and respected by their peers communicate expectations and values, we expect that the  message will more impactful coming from their peers.       MS 328 will continue to provide incentives and support for its high achieving students through participation in the  National Junior Honor Society. Students who are selected will demonstrate strict academic and behavioral expectations.  In N.J.H.S. students will be offered rigorous academic enrichment in ELA and Math, participate in the Thurgood Marshall  Mock Trial Competition, run school activities to promote social, mental, and physical well being, and create an urban  farm in the complex’s courtyard. Each one of these components of N.J.H.S. aids these selected students by developing  them as responsible students and citizens. This impacts the entire school because it provides these students with a  chance to showcase positive attributes to other classmates and promote positive citizenship and scholarship.       The school’s social-emotional learning framework is based upon a system of Positive Behavior Intervention and Support  (PBIS). The framework institutes the school mantra of T.E.A.M. This represents the characteristics that the school  attempts to instill in each student: Trustworthy, Eager, Accountable, and Mature. Student behaviors, including  punctuality, classroom performance and social interactions are tracked daily and students earn points for positive  behaviors. At risk students are identified and referred to the school’s Student Intervention Team. Students are also   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      36      identified as positive community members and earn trips and tickets to enriching events to highlight those who are  displaying the attributes we believe each student should possess.       Working in concert with our CBO, Center for Supportive Schools, the school’s Guidance Counselor and Dean received  training in overseeing a peer-mentoring program, (Peer Group Connection, PGC) between 8 th grade students and  students in the sixth grade. Selected 8 th grade students will receive training in mentoring and be matched with an  incoming 6 th grade students to teach and instill values for academic excellence and positive citizenship.       Center for Supportive Schools has also implemented the Success Mentoring program, partnering identified severely  chronically absent, chronically absent, and at-risk students with a caring school based adult for a daily mentoring  program focusing on identifying and working towards achieving increased attendance through goal setting and  identifying possible interventions.       Expanded Learning Time (ELT)/Renewal Hour and after school programming in partnership with LEAP (Learning through  an Expanded Arts Program) focusing on STEM, ELA, math, arts enrichment, and athletics courses. This partnership will  focus on working with grade level and subject level teacher teams to focus all ELT and afterschool programs to meet the  academic needs identified for targeted cohorts of students.

What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide,   Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review?      During the 2018-19 school year, the school will focus it’s improvement on tenet 4.3: Teachers provide coherent, and  appropriately aligned Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS)-based instruction that leads to multiple points of access  for all students.   The school has systems and structures in place to ensure teacher support and build capacity to provide coherent and  appropriately aligned common core learning standards based instruction that leads to multiple points of access for all  learners. One particular strength in this area is the work that the school completed during the 2017-18 school year  through lesson studies.    Through the Lesson Study process teachers prepared and shared lessons with the whole staff during our Monday PD  before teaching the lesson. The lesson is planned using a uniform template that everyone agrees to use. In this way, we  are able to examine the lesson moment by moment, from beginning to end. Later in the week, we all observe the lesson  as it is taught. The following Monday, we debrief our observations as a whole staff, using protocol guidelines. Based  upon our debrief of the lesson, as well as our analysis of student work produced from it, we make determinations to  modify the lesson (or not) to ensure access for all learners. Later, the same lesson is taught to another cohort of  students and the process repeats.       2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      44      Our work has not only sufficed to encourage careful lesson construction and reflective mindsets, it also provided  teachers with support to revise lesson to ensure access for all learners. Above all, however, it has also encouraged  collaboration and has built respect among colleagues who trust each other to be honest and supportive.       The school’s challenges include:    · That 26% of students are ELLs   · 25% of students are SWDs    · Almost 20 percent of families reside in temporary housing shelters   · Steep in enrollment changes between September and June.   In order to ensure that teachers consistently provide coherent instruction that is not only aligned to the CCLS, but also  leads to multiple points of access for all learners, the school will continue to implement a professional learning plan that  provides:   v Weekly professional development focused around the lesson study process.    v Extend the work from the 2017-18 school year to include explicit strategies for engaging all learners in the school’s  instructional focus – Quality interactions . For us this is defined by positive cooperation between learners, accountable  talk and full student engagement that leads to greater access for all learners to meet and exceed standards-based  instruction      v And continue to provide structures for collaboration, including weekly grade level and content area teacher team  meetings.         Part 2 – Summative Vision for Collaborative Teachers   What is your vision for collaborative teaching?        Upon completion of the renewal school program our teachers will be provided with multiple opportunities to work  together toward common goals, improving student learning, assessment and instruction.    Our Common Planning Time will allow teachers to meet in interdisciplinary teams, coordinate team procedures and  policies, discuss student achievement, meet with parents, plan team activities, and examine student work. Teacher  teams will ensure that students are able to connect learning in one class to what they are learning in another because  teachers will work together to create meaningful, cross-curricular links between subjects. They will develop and share a  variety of practices and approaches that promote student enthusiasm and engagement.    Our Professional Learning Community time will allow teachers from the same discipline to analyze student work using  common protocols, create unit and lesson plans, analyze student assessment data in relation to specific learning targets,  set next steps for students at all levels and use these data to inform and assess effectiveness of instruction.    2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      45      Our Critical support structure will allow teachers to partake in several inquiry cycles during the course of the school  year. It also will allow teachers to work in tandem with colleagues to study researched-based teaching strategies,  practice implementation, observe one another teach and provide critical and supportive feedback to one another  through a process called lesson studies. The team will also customize and craft lessons using Bloom’s Higher Levels of  Taxonomy to engage higher achieving students and strategies to ensure access for all learners.       Peer Collaborative Teachers will be an integral part of the school’s support structures. The school currently has two lead  teachers (English language arts and mathematics). They attend professional development workshops given by the New  Teacher Center on a regular basis throughout the year. They engage with teachers to continue implementing the  Common Core coherently, while they support teachers by using a structured peer learning model to foster student  participation in their own learning process. They also serve as mentors for beginning teachers. Through the renewal  school process our Lead Teachers will transition to the role of Peer collaborative Teachers. They will function in similar  roles as they have before with the added continued support of the New Teacher Center, a district 9 Initiative.      Our community partners will help bring in professional development workshops that are rooted in research-based  instructional practices that call for all teachers to work together in collaborative teams that collectively comprise a PLC  (Professional Learning Communities).                     How do you envision collaboration amongst your School Instructional Cabinet to improve teacher practices and  student learning?  The school instructional cabinet will monitor teacher ASW (Analysis of Student Work) at the end of each unit in cycles of  6-8 weeks, juxtaposing student baseline writing data with current student writing in order to determine growth.          How do you envision collaboration within teacher teams to improve teacher practices and student learning?   Using the Professional Learning Communities and Data Wise structures, teacher teams will collaborate to: (1) norm  writing grading practices, anchored to Teachers College writing rubrics; (2) teachers will collaborate to conduct 4-6  lesson studies informed by student work to hone best pedagogical practices to support student achievement in writing.          How do you envision collaboration across teacher teams to improve teacher practices and student learning?   Using the Professional Learning Communities and Data Wise structures, teacher teams will collaborate with one another  to ensure: (1) normed writing grading practices, anchored to Teachers College writing rubrics across grade and content  teams; (2) teachers will collaborate to conduct 4-6 lesson studies informed by student work to hone best pedagogical  practices to support student achievement in writing shared across content and grade teams.      What data will teachers and the School Instructional Cabinet regularly review to ensure that they are reflecting upon  their teaching practices and meeting individual student learning needs?  What is the intent for reviewing each piece of  data? (ex. Teachers will regularly review student IEPs when developing lessons in order to ensure that tasks are  appropriately scaffolded.)  2018-19 RSCEP-PF             46            To determine learner strengths and needs anchored to CCLS reading and writing standards.

Additional ELT - If there is a voluntary ELT program in addition to the compulsory Renewal ELT, indicate how you will  actively encourage the participation of all students, with the goal of serving at least 50% of students.     The ELT program will be twofold: Part voluntary and part mandated.    Mandated Program: All students will be required to stay for an additional hour of instruction, Monday through  Friday. This time will be rolled into their day and included in their schedule. This hour of instruction will be provided  by classroom teachers, working in tandem with our school community partner organizations.    Voluntary: Saturday and Holiday Academy will be offered to all students for instruction and arts and sports  enrichment. Students will be incentivized to attend through monthly experiential learning trips, linked to the core  curriculum.

Math Instruction will be provided through a partnership with Achieve High Points, a tablet based math application  which caters instruction to the needs of students, based on a pre-assessment taken by each student. Students will be  divided into three differentiated groups based on ability. Students will be identified by performance into one of three  groups:   · Group 1: far below proficiency level (below 2.08 proficiency)   · Group 2: approaching proficiency level (2.09 – 2.59 proficiency level)   · Group 3: meeting/exceeding proficiency level (above 2.6 proficiency level)       Students in Group 1 will use TAI to address their skill deficits. Students in Groups 2 and 3 will use the Achieve High  Points tablet in addition to the web based Mathletics program to strengthen their skills.   In ELA, students will be divided into four sub-groups using the CCLS aligned Independent Reading Level Assessment  (IRLA):   · Group 1 – students reading at or above grade level   · Group 2 – students one year below grade level   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      72      · Group 3 – two or more years below grade level   · Group 4 – two or more years below grade level – ELL      Students will use myON , which provides anytime, anywhere access to a library of more than 8,000 enhanced digital  books with multimedia supports, real-time reporting and assessments and embedded close reading tools. Students  will also receive small-group instruction at this time, with options for guided reading and/or book clubs. Student  reading growth will be tracked on myON and their reading levels and conference logs will be logged in the SchoolPace  database.       Our Saturday and Holiday programs will be offered to all students for extra-instruction and enrichment.  Understanding that students “vote with their feet” in a voluntary program, the school instructional team will work  with our CBO partners to organize fun recreational activities in the fall and spring to entice families and students to  see the school as a positive community center that offers enriching opportunities to socialize as well as learn. In order  to do this, we will facilitate:   · ELL Saturday Academy   · Math Support Academy   · Reading Book Clubs   · Saturday basketball league (girls and boys)   · Volley-ball   · Gaming competitions   · Dance    · Choir   Additional Information:    How will community educators receive professional development?

Part 1 – The Community School Program Goal(s)   Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School program for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct  the goal to be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.  Meeting your SMART goal  should directly impact meeting at least one of your Renewal Benchmarks and/or Demonstrable Improvement  Benchmarks.     By June 2019, the community school model will be implemented to increase student leadership and family  engagement. This will be achieved through targeted programming utilizing CBO providers (ELT, Afterschool); shared  health and mental health services; family-focused workshops, classes, and events; evidence-based programs for  student leadership and mentoring; and creating systems for sustainable data tracking targeting improvement of  student attendance and family engagement.    In addition by June 2019, our goal is to decrease our chronically absent students by 8% from 28% to 20% by  bolstering the school's PBIS system, sharing attendance data and goals at weekly town hall meetings, and providing  group mentorship to students.            Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Community School Program Annual Goal:  Which Renewal and/or Demonstrable Improvement Benchmarks do you expect will improve by meeting your  Community School Program Annual Goal?

Describe how the school will meet the NYCDOE requirements for a Community School in the School Renewal  program.  1.   Renewal Schools are expected to partner with a community-based partner organization (CBO) and together  with members of the School Leadership Team, hire a Community School Director. The Director will lead  implementation of the asset and needs  assessment process, and other critically important coordinating  activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work.  Renewal Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and  services, as determined by the asset and needs  assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time  (ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the  right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly  coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day.  Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to  strengthen this initiative.  Renewal Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and families  feel welcome,  actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of their  schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community  School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this  family  engagement strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work.  Renewal School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director,  select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual  students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use.  Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work.   2.   3.   4.      Center for Supportive Schools (CSS) will be the school’s lead CBO partner. In partnership with the school, CSS will hire  a Community School Director. The Director will be responsible for the day-to-day management of the community  school strategy, facilitating and providing leadership for the collaborative process of developing a continuum of  services for children, families, and community members. The Director will drive development of community school  action plans and planning for sustainability. S/he will track the school’s progress against performance goals, collect  school data, and support program evaluation activities and manage partnerships. The Director will ensure that the  community school strategy is implemented at exceptional levels of quality with full support, buy-in, and regular  communication with stakeholders across the school community. Specific position responsibilities will include:    • Build and maintain relationships with administration, faculty, staff, students, parents, and community partners   • Organize and expand upon the membership of the Community School Team (CST) to include diverse school  community stakeholders and CBOs   • Conduct a needs assessment process, including: reviewing school and student-level data; conducting focus groups  with parents, students, faculty, staff, administrators, and community partners; and reviewing and/or conducting  school climate and culture survey   • Conduct a community asset assessment to identify viable partnerships that can meet the needs of students and  families of the school community, including developing metrics for partnership evaluation   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      77      • Recruit and develop partnership agreements with people and community organizations willing to offer programs  and services for students and families at the school in accordance with identified needs   • Identify evidence and research-based practices and/or partnerships that address priority areas for the community  school strategy, which may include but are not limited to: Parent/Family Engagement; Community Engagement;  Youth Development; Academic Rigor and Instructional Practices; Health and Mental Health; Tutoring; After school  programming; Mentoring; and Early Childhood   • Develop, maintain, and publicize a schedule of programs and activities offered at the school    • Implement and maintain a process that encourages referrals to programs and services offered at the school   • Identify needs of chronically absent students, apply interventions, and track and monitor impact of interventions  on weekly basis, as part of weekly Student Success Summit   • Collect and monitor program implementation data and student data for each partnership that allow easy data  analysis and interaction by the SLT and other school stakeholders      CSS, in partnership with the school, will assess all students’ personalized needs to ensure appropriate programming  opportunities are provided within the school day and during Expanded Learning Time (ELT).    In-school support for students will be provided through the integration of one or more of CSS’s core solutions that  provide an integrated focus on academic, social, and emotional learning, such that every student and family has  strong relationships with the school community and an individualized pathway to success. Specific student supports  implemented may include:   • an evidence-based intervention that supports school transitions by leveraging older students as leaders and  mentors for new and incoming students (Peer Group Connection);   • an evidence-based targeted intervention for high needs students that pairs adult school staff with students in one- to-one mentoring relationships proven to reduce problem behaviors and improve academics (Achievement  Mentoring).       Working with the principal, SLT, and CST, CSS will identify specialist partnerships to provide comprehensive expanded  learning and enrichment opportunities, and mental health services to meet the needs of all students. The school’s  current partnerships with CBOs such as Dreamyard and Pathways to Leadership will be expanded to supplement ELT  provided by teachers for academic support. In addition, CSS and the school will identify and implement additional  partnerships to provide ELT academic support in math, science, and ELA that create additional opportunities for  students to engage in content and support teachers in developing project-based, engaging instructional practices  that can be integrated into curriculum. A mental health partner will be identified in partnership with the assigned  Mental Health Manager to provide Social Worker(s) and additional mental health resources for students and families.       Parents and families will be welcomed into the school’s Parent Center, which will provide a safe, supportive place for  parents to access resources at the school. All parents will be engaged in parent-teacher conferences at designated  times during the school year but will also have opportunities to visit classrooms and engage in first-hand experience  of their child’s academic learning throughout the year. Parents will also be invited to participate in monthly   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      78      Community School Team meetings, focus groups, and other forums where they can contribute their voices to the  conversation and decision-making around the renewal of their schools. Workshops provided for parents, by the  Parent Coordinator, CSS, and other community partners, will focus on helping them learn how to advocate for their  children.       The Director will conduct a weekly standing meeting with the Principal, Assistant Principal, key staff, and  representatives from other CBO partners, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual students. The  Director will provide a data summary for the team to review at each meeting. Each team member will also come  prepared to discuss key questions and updates in areas of community school work where they are taking initiative.  Each week, a selected 2-3 team members will also come prepared to discuss individual students and families to  strategize with the team about how to provide improved support using a case conferencing model.

The joint ELT program will be structured as follows:    · Teachers will have the opportunity to propose and implement ELT opportunities for students throughout the school  year in response to student needs. Teachers will work with CSS and school leadership to access appropriate resources  and curricula to support their ELT work.    2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      79      · LEAP will be our main after school service provider. They will host afternoon supper before breaking out into  activities for students until 5:30 p.m.   CSS will require all partners to submit monthly impact reports assessing program quality based upon measures  defined in the partnership agreements. These reports will serve as an ongoing common framework for  communication between the CSS and the school and partners.    CSS will use a variety of mechanisms to track progress. Data will be presented on each outcome in Community School  Team and School Leadership Team meeting within a "data snapshot" where the comprehensive data can be viewed in  one dashboard view. This data will be used to assess progress towards meeting the above defined outcomes and to  address challenges if outcomes are not being met. Specific ways to track progress for key outcomes include:   · Successful implementation and operation of the Community School Team will be tracked based on: representative  composition from all community stakeholders; number of members committed to the team compared to average  meeting attendance; evaluations completed after CST meetings that assess the extent to which each member finds  the meetings to be well-managed, collaborative, and productive.    · Increased parent engagement will be tracked based on: participation in Parent Association meetings; participation in  ongoing needs assessment and feedback activities; participation in parent services provided; the number of parents  who assume specific roles in the Community Schools effort; participation in parent-teacher conferences; teachers  who report developing positive relationships with parents through weekly phone calls and other means of  communication; parents who report developing positive relationships with teachers through weekly phone calls and  other means of communication.    · Increased student participation in expanded learning and enrichment activities will be tracked based on: attendance  in activities; inventory and evaluation of services and activities provided; the number of students who assume  leadership roles in expanded learning and enrichment activities.    · Increased utilization rates for mental health services and improved mental health will be tracked based on: the  number and demographics of students and families that participate in services compared to the entire target  population; frequency of support utilized compared with recommended frequency of support provided; evaluations  from students and families reporting on perceived impact of services; student academic performance data  improvements and other on-track indicator improvements.    · Increased school resources will be tracked based on: the estimated value of in-kind services rendered; targeted  students served before and after implementation of community school strategy and estimated cost per student; and  value of additional resources generated for the school to provide community school services and support by CSS  and/or other CBO partners.      Part 3b. Indicate resources needed including human resources, instructional resources, and schedule adjustments to  implement the Community School program.  · A Community School Director will be hired by CSS.    · Teachers will be requested to provide support for ELT.    · CBO partners will be contracted to provide additional in-school support and support for ELT to compensate for and  supplement the support that can be provided by teachers.    · The school schedule will remain on the same schedule as SY2018-19 with at least one additional hour (the Renewal  Hour) added to the schedule for each student.    · To implement Peer Group Connection (PGC), selected 8 th grade students will participate in a daily peer leadership  course. Two to three times per month for 45 minutes, 8 th grade peer leaders will “push-in” to all 6 th grade classes to  2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      80         conduct activity-based sessions that support 6 th grade students’ social and emotional development and help them to  positively transition into our school.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (RSCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/RSCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      87      achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      88      Section 11: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between family-focused parental involvement and student  achievement. The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure evidence- based involvement of parents and community in the school. 09X328, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I,  Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   MS 328X will support parents and families of Title I students by:      · providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   · providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   · fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   · providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      89      · sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   · providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      The school’s Parent Involvement      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.          In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   · actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   · engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated directly  to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   · ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   · support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

English Language Learners are one of the top groups in high school drop -out in New York City  since the majority of them and their families are not provided with ta necessary road to college  plan to help ELLs’ families understand academic needs, financial plan, and other college  requirements before ELLs reach to high schools. Adding to this the realistic that the great  majority of ELLs arrive to high school behind their peers because they do not have the academic  language needed to compete at the high school level.     09X328’s ELLs Title III Program grant application is to help/support/motivate our ELLs and  their family to develop language 2, English, by providing extra academic support and a college  road plan awareness and readiness throughout the middle school experience.  Therefore, Title III  Funding is requested to implement and extend our Literacy Saturday Academy for English  Language Learners offer, provide early college knowledge and experience to our students  through partnerships with different local and possible out of state colleges students recognized  groups, and faculties. In addition, 09X328 is combining resources to provide different workshops  for parents and students focusing on the acquisition of language 2 (English) and different aspects  of the road to college plan, including information on how to guide middle schoolers to combine  academic requirements with theirs sports and fine arts performing abilities to acquire college  grants. Furthermore, funding will be used for the purchase instructional text materials, and  technological resources; reading software and hardware for the school’s resource room as well as  expanding the numbers of licenses of already existing program such as Imagine Learning  ……………….. and to provide professional development to all staff members participating in  our Saturday Academy on best practices to teach ENL and method to raise early college  awareness and preparedness for ELLs at the middle school level.      09X328’s Title III funds will be used in combination with our ELLs College Awareness and  Preparedness Program to expand the already planned and scheduled Saturday School Academy,  which provide the necessary extra support to 90 to 100 English Language Learners (ELLs) in  grades 6th, 7th, and 8th and their parents, during our Saturday Academy.   All of our ELLs  students are invited to participate in our Saturday Academy (8:00AM to 12:00PM) from  Saturday, November 10, 2017 through Saturday June 8, 2018. The College and Career Readiness  Initiative for English Language Learners funds will allows us to integrate a college motivation  and preparedness component designed to support middle school children and families to develop  college awareness and interest.

The academy will accommodates ELLs who  belong to different Immigrant generations and language acquisition levels.  Title III Saturday Academy provides English Literacy instruction and mathematics to ELLs. Our  Saturday Academy focuses on second language instruction to all English Language Learners.  The Saturday Academy is designed to help ELLs in their adaptation and language acquisition  process. The integration of the College Awareness and Preparedness Program Grant to the  Saturday Academic is going to improve our offering on student and family’s engagement by  adding a college advisory sessions for each one of the different ELLs subgroups and their parents  every Saturday for the entire duration of the program. In addition, colleges and cultural  institutions visits will be scheduled during weekdays and Saturdays for students and parent to  attend workshops on college awareness in campus and acquires social and cultural knowledges  to prepare and motivate both parents and students to focus on acquiring a college degree.    Title III Grant for English Language Learners will provide us support to targets second language  acquisition through literacy in the second language (English); Students will receive the benefit of  small-group instruction to address the range in linguistic and academic abilities among them. In  the English New Language (ENL)/English literacy classroom, instruction is going to be provided  by an ENL teacher and an English Language Arts literacy teacher who will make emphasis on  the acquisition of Academic English Language. English Literacy teachers will co-plan with ENL  certified teachers for instruction and professional development.    Students will be grouped based on their NYSESLAT and NYSITELL score. In addition, all of  our students who have acquired a commanding score on the NYSESLAT in the last 3 years are  invited to participate in our regular Title III Saturday program and College awareness and  Preparedness Program.    Two school aides will serve as out of classroom support, during the Saturday academy, covering  the Main Office, school hallways, photo copies, cafeteria duty, and to make phone calls to  parents in order to keep 100% attendance. They will be paid from other sources.    To ensure the academic quality of the instruction and the safety of all students, the Principal  and/or one of the Assistant Principals will supervise the implementation of the Saturday  Academy. The supervisor will conduct informal observations, professional developments, and  collect and organize students' data to inform instruction, assessments, and evaluate the  implementation and progression of the Title III Saturday Academy.  In addition, performance  data, purchase, and distribution of needed materials to all pedagogical staff participating in the  Saturday Academy.

They are a vital part of our school's  Leadership Team. Parents of both ELLs and  our immigrant population are oriented to the  programs we offer as well as programs offered by the NYCDOE. They are informed of the  related policies as well as assessments, state standards, school expectations and policies. We  communicate regularly with parents through our monthly school calendar and PA  meetings.Workshops are also conducted for the parents to address their concerns. Bilingual staff  is in attendance to provide translation. Parental notification of non English speaking parents is  done through school personnel as mentioned above. The Principal’s communications regarding  rules, regulations as well as school information is done via translated memorandum. Our Parent  Coordinator and the family workers who are on the school premises are available during the day  for the Spanish speaking families. We also access the translation unit’s services for oral  translation over the phone for languages other than Spanish. In this manner we are able to  communicate to our non-English parents and students. Parents receive phone calls and letters  from teachers that inform about the after school program and the students' progress. We provide  an over the-phone interpreter when calling parents. We make sure that activities in the Title III  program for parents are based on parental interest gathered from surveys and questionnaires in  both English and Spanish.Many of the parents at MS 328 are ELLs themselves. They struggle  with the English language and want support in learning the language. In addition, they also have  difficulty helping their children at home with the academics.  All Title III Parents are will invited to participate in Saturday Parent Beginner ESL course. A  certified ENL teacher will provide instruction weekly for 3 hours 12 weeks, beginning  November through May from 9:00-12:00. In addition to the activities and events included on  Parts B and C, topics to be covered include, during our Title III Saturday Academy are:  Employment seeking, writing a resume, completing an application and filling out government  service forms.  The ENL teacher and the Parent Coordinator, will reach out to parents through  notification letters, fliers, and phone calls. Additional parent workshops will be run throughout  the school year. These workshops will be 60 minutes long and will occur in the evening from  4:00-5:00. Ms. Dannenhoffer our certified ENL teacher will lead these workshops. Topics to be  covered during the year include: How to help your child with reading and writing at home, how  to help your child with homework, and how to prepare your child for the NYSESLAT Parent  invitations will be sent out in English and in the parents' preferred language. When parents arrive  at the workshop, they will sign an attendance sheet. The attendance sheet and a copy of the  agenda will be stored in a locked cabinet in the main office.       2018-19 RSCEP-PF  102                        Part E: Budget   FOR SCHOOLS NOT CONCEPTUALLY CONSOLIDATED ONLY.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  At MS 328 we use ELL Periodic Assessment as an initial assessment.School leadership uses the results of the ELL Periodic  Assessments to know performance levels of different classes in the school in reading, writing and listening. Knowledge of  common strengths and weaknesses aids our administrators in planning curriculum and selecting leveled text for units of study.  Through item analysis, the ESL teacher uses the results to plan lessons for whole classes and individual students. Teachers also  ascertain which particular skill areas students are proficient in, as well as, where they are having difficulty. Based on the ELL  Periodic Assessment data, we know that the ELLs can benefit from increased reading and writing practice.  Through  differentiated instruction, teachers use alternate text and varied writing activities to help students build literacy.   We also use the NYSESLAT, NYSITELL, the ELA exam results, and teacher made tests/observations to learn which specific   2018-19 RSCEP-PF  105                              learning skills our ELLs are not meeting the standard on and based on these data, we make plans to target these skills in their  instruction.           2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Unit of Study, on-going Formative Assessment as well as End-of-Unit Assessment with a specific testing modifications for  Second Language Learners using the NYSESLAT modalities, Speaking, Listening, Reading and Writing.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The success of our program for ELLs is based on how much they have improved in a three year span. We hope to have them  improve from an entering level to a commanding level on the NYSESLAT within  three years .                    4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Extended school day, Saturday Academy, Integrated and Stand-Alone ENL Services provided during the school day for all  Proficiency Levels of our English Language Learners.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Not Applicable       6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The NYSESLAT report indicates that the ELLs data pattern across proficiency levels have increased based on the report from  2016 to 2017. Data shows that students in a three year span have increased from a beginners level to an advanced level of  proficiency. Report also indicates students progressing with gains throughout the modalities even though very few are still at  the same proficiency level.  When students enter in September of the school year and take the NYSELAT in the spring, scores  indicate a gain mostly jumping from a low score to an intermediate level score and from an intermediate score to an advanced  or proficient one.         For the 2016 year, one student was given the NYSITELL and the student scored as a beginner (Entering level).The 2017  NYSESLAT data reveals that the majority of the ELLs   in our school are in the advanced level. However, while many of the ELLs  scored proficient in the listening/speaking modality, most of them scored intermediate or advanced in the reading/writing  modality.                  7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Instructional Cabinet, Whole Staff Data Wise Weekly Meeting, ENL support meetings with the BFSC Coach         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students   2018-19 RSCEP-PF  106                              regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   The ENL program at MS 328 is a pull-out/push-in program with homogeneous proficiency level groups. All  ENL  students are placed into a grade specific class, which travels as a group. Our students receive both Stand Alone ENL  and Integrated ENL based on their proficiency level as per part 154 Regulations. The ELL students come to school with  little English or at various levels of acquisition and thus differentiating instruction is essential to meeting their  language development needs.  The SIFE students are tested by the ENL teacher and provided instruction based on  their needs to provide equitable instruction at their grade level during the designated Literacy periods within their  schedules. Scaffolding is a very important strategy we use.  For the ELLs with less than three years we focus on  teaching stories and other informational texts at the grade level. We also help improve  the vocabulary  and grammar.  Our focus for the advanced students is teaching more complicated stories and information as well as test-taking  strategies. Special attention is paid to the students with special needs. Their groups are smaller, two of three  students, so the ENL teacher can work one-to-one. Our students receive high quality instruction based on their  individualized academic and behavioral needs. The ESL teachers cooperate with the content area teachers in planning  lessons so that every student is given access to the general education curriculum and is educated alongside general  education peers. The ENL teacher provide content area support for ELLs by embedding explicit strategies for language  development within content lessons. The teachers determine the background knowledge that the students need to  understand the content, incorporate ENL objectives while plannin lessons, provide models and demonstrations, use  graphic organizers, simplify the language, and display visual representations. In addition, all ENL students are  mandated to attend the Extended Afternoon Program and Saturday Enrichment Program in preparation for the ELA  exam and the NYSESLAT. A lot of times the ENL teacher helps the ELL students that have passed the NYSESLAT. All  staff members have participated in school wide and network level professional development, which includes but is  not limited to QTEL and SIOP. Ms. Dannenhoffer, the ENL teacher has participated in QTEL, SIOP, Achieve 3000,  regional workshops and BER seminars.     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              We make sure that the mandated instructional minutes are provided according to the proficiency levels.  The ENL  teacher is aware of the New York State mandated minutes of instruction for the ELLs. MS 328 is in compliance in regards to our  programming and scheduling based upon these state mandates. ESL students identified as either Entering (E) or Emerging (E)  receive 360 minutes of Stand Alone ENL /Integrated ENL instruction per week, ESL students identified as Transitioning (T) and  Expanding (E) receive 180 minutes of Integrated ENL instruction per week. Commanding students (including the former ELLs)  receive 90 minutes of Integrated ENL per week. The mainstream students are pulled out from ELA during Stand Alone ENL.  When pulled out from ELA, we make sure that ESL strategies are used to understand the ELA requirements. We always make  sure that NLA is used to expand our students’ acquisition of the second language if necessary.                  3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      At MS 328 the teachers use instructional practices that make content more accessible and comprehensible for ELLs using  SIOP practices inclusive of  building background, relating the material to the students cultural understanding, using language  accessible to the students and emphasizing key vocabulary through a variety of activities.  Additionally the content area  teachers provide multiple opportunities for discussion and comprehension development based on experiments and projects   2018-19 RSCEP-PF  107                           conducted in class with readily available opportunities for students to analyze data, and learn the scientific experiment  methods. In addition, ENL classes include instruction designed to improve content area achievement. For example the use of  Keys to Learning series textbooks in ENL classes gives teachers the opportunity to teach and reinforce non-fiction, content area  reading and writing strategies.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      Spanish-speaking students are administered the Spanish LAB as part of the in-take process. In addition to the NYSITELL and  Spanish LAB exams, MS 328 has a brief placement test for new admits that includes a section where we ask students for  writing samples in both their native language and English. If this sample leads us to suspect that there are literacy or learning  difficulties, we follow up using either the parent coordinator who speaks the home language or the DOE Interpretation hot line  in order to assure that students with additional needs receive additional services. Even though students at MS 328 are not  provided with Native Language Arts, they are provided with native language support through the provision of bilingual  dictionaries and bilingual content area glossaries. Newcomer ESL students are provided with bilingual books and dictionaries to  support learning, and special education ELLs are provided with bilingual paraprofessionals, when available.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Our school has created an educational environment that is supportive of SIFEs. Our teachers understand the students' needs  and have been specially trained to assist in accelerating SIFE' academic achievement while monitoring cultural and emotional  adjustment. The ENL teacher plays a great role in helping these students progress through differentiation of instruction. The  teachers plan lessons that build in prior knowledge, challenge but scaffold onto what the students know or have learned, and  use culturally relevant, linguistically sensitive, and age appropriate material.  In addition to the mandated hours already specified for our ELLs via the ELL push-in pull-out program, MS 328 also provides  intervention services to all ELLs. We have a designated SETTS teacher that works individually with ELL students that require  additional assistance in math, ELA, or other content area subjects.  ELLs who have been receiving ENL instruction for no more than 3 years receive intensive targeted instruction in reading,  writing, speaking, and listening in small group settings. There is a focus on using audio equipment to provide these students  with more practice with conversation, listening skills, improve comprehension and develop fluency to improve literacy overall.  Ells receiving services 4 - 6 years are the largest number in our school. An analysis of their scores on the NYSESLAT, ELA and  Math assessments suggests that their problem is one of reading and writing. Our plan with the 4-6 year group is to 1.) use  collaborative strategies (e.g. QTEL) and plan activities that encourage higher-level thinking skills, 2.) explicitly teach academic  vocabulary to enhance comprehensible input in the content areas, 3.) allow students to use technology such as Achieve High  Points 2-4 times a week during class and after school, and 4.) help students to relate to information in a meaningful way  through project-based learning, which concludes with a synthesis and application of what students have learned during a  thematic unit. As abilities and skills in English vary greatly, many of the strategies used with newcomers and SIFE students can  also be employed to the 4-6 year group.     The goal for our long term ELLs (ELLs who have been receiving ESL instruction for at least 6 years) is to reach English language  proficiency by the end of the school year. There will be a focus on the development of academic language and creative and  critical thinking skills.  Our plan for the ELLs identified as having special needs is to continue to give them intensive targeted instruction in small group  settings as well as encourage them to attend our Extended Afternoon Program and Saturday Enrichment Program.  Our plan for the ELLs that have reached proficiency on the NYSESLAT is to continue to provide them with transitional support.  They will be awarded with ESL mandated New York State testing modifications for two additional years, and they will be  supplied with bilingual glossaries.  All classroom teachers have laptops and smart boards that provide additional visual and technological support to our ELLs.   2018-19 RSCEP-PF  108                           MS 328 recognizes that ELLs require specialized materials. The ENL teacher uses books that are rich in content to promote  language and conceptual development, and they are made accessible through the pictures or the print so that students at all  levels can benefit. The ENL teacher uses large visuals, graphic organizers, and other materials essential to making content  comprehensible. To ensure the effectiveness of ESL instructional delivery, the ENL teacher administers periodic assessments in  which the students’ products are compared with the standards. This information is also shared with the classroom teachers in  an effort to create a support team for effectively meeting the needs of ELLs.  Intervention Services are provided for all of our English Language Learners. The Extended Day/ After-School Program for  Entering and Emerging ENL students takes place between 3:35 P.M. to 5:30 P.M. Tuesday-Friday. Here, these students  receive additional support in the four modalities of reading, writing, listening, and speaking. We will also offer a Saturday  Enrichment Program in which the ESL teacher will utilize a balanced literacy instructional approach. Students will participate in  90 minute literacy blocks which contain a reading and writing workshop. These reading and writing workshops are comprised  of independent reading, a mini-lesson, an active engagement, a work period and a closing. The Expanding ELL students will  work through author, genre, and thematic studies. The Entering, Emerging, and Transitioning ELL students will focus on the  skills of reading, writing, listening, and speaking through the use of thematic units of study. In addition, all ELL students are  offered  after school and Saturday programs in  ELA, Math, and other content area subjects. All ELL students will also be  offered a NYSESLAT preparation course after school in the spring semester.  For the upcoming school year, a number of improvements are being considered for the ENL regular day and after school  programs. For example, the ENL curriculum being developed this year has many content-area aspects, touching upon social  studies, mathematics, and science. Achieve High Points and MyOn are also a new part of the ESL instruction. We are focusing  more on project-based learning this year, asking students to master vocabulary, grammar, content, and concepts through  critical thinking and inquiry about leveled high-interest readings, using both prior and background knowledge. Students will  produce various products using all four modalities of speaking, listening, reading, and writing. Students will compose  essays,create PowerPoint presentations, and write on blogs. Students will also participate in activities that involve  collaboration, such as the creation of posters, maps, and multimedia. In addition, we will continue to buy scholastic books to  enrich our library. We will also purchase books in the students' native languages.         6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   The ESL program at MS 328 uses the Keys to Learning series.  The series’ levels range from A to E, and the students will be  leveled by their 2018 NYSESLAT or NYSITELL scores. The  series provide standards- based instruction in reading, writing,  listening, and speaking, and it is designed to accelerate the language and literacy growth of ELLs.  In order to differentiate instruction for the ELLs, our school has several programs in place that provide supplementary support.  Achieve High Points is a program that assists our students strengthen their math skills and allows for differentiated instruction  within the classroom.  This program addresses the needs of all our ELL’S and is aligned with our school’s vision of technology to  foster learning.  In addition, our school uses MyON, a personalized reading program for students of all literacy levels.                  7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Differentiated instructional methods include the use of small groups and cooperative learning (with occasional one-on-one  instruction), both of which seem to enhance inclusion, peer acceptance, access to the general education curriculum, and  improved student achievement based on classroom observation data. Additionally, teachers use guided reading and small- group instruction. They adapt instruction for ELL-SWD students. ELL-SWD students requiring accommodations (i.e. additional  time for classroom tests/projects, etc) work directly with our IEP coordinator, who has a schedule which has been  programmed to allow for flexibility to work with these students when needed. We have given the ENL teacher a flexible  schedule so he is able to service all the ELL students and give the instructional time  required for ELL-SWDs too. He works  closely with other service providers also.                 2018-19 RSCEP-PF  109                           8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  After school classes and tutoring in ESL, ELA, Math, Regents Preparation, Science and Social Studies are offered to support the  transition of ELLs. Bilingual dictionaries and visuals are used in content area classes to support content comprehension and  mastery.  Intervention Services are provided for all of our English Language Learners. The Extended Day/ After-School Program for  Beginners and Intermediate ENL students takes place between 3:35 P.M. to 5:30 P.M. Tuesday-Friday. Here, these students  receive additional support in the four modalities of reading, writing, listening, and speaking. We  also offer a Saturday  Enrichment     Program in which the ESL teachers  utilize a balanced literacy instructional approach. Students  participate in 90 minute  literacy blocks which contain a reading and writing workshop. These reading and writing workshops are comprised of  independent reading, a mini-lesson, an active engagement, a work period and a closing. The Advanced ELL students  work  through author, genre, and thematic studies. The beginning and intermediate ELL students will focus on the skills of reading,  writing, listening, and speaking through the use of thematic units of study. In addition, all ELL students are offered  after school  and Saturday programs in  ELA, Math, and other content area subjects. All ELL students will also be offered a NYSESLAT  preparation course after school in the spring semester.                 9.

(Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  All of our ELL personnel and teacher of ELLs are highly encouraged to attend and participate in numerous professional  development seminars intended to provide additional support and knowledge regarding the instruction of our ELL students,  and all students throughout the academic school year. At MS 328, we hold weekly administration-initiated and/or teacher- initiated professional development workshops for all teachers. In addition, our ENL teacher frequently attends professional  development seminars and workshops related to ENL curriculum and instruction throughout the academic year. This year we  are focusing on Danielson and SIOP training  in many of our professional development seminars.    Throughout the 2018 - 2019 school year, our ESl teacher will receive professional development in effective ESl instructional  practices inhouse and outside the school building courtesy of our Borough Office. Similar PD opportunities will be accessible to  general education teachers as well. Through horizontal and vertical lesson planning collaboration, teachers will have the  opportunity to share best common practices-to best serve our ELL populations. The 7.5 hours of professional development  offered to all staff include differentiated instruction, use of technology in the classroom, behavior management, SIOP and Q- TEL training, utilizing data sources effectively, and effective use of manipulatives in the classroom.  Staff development began in  September 2016. We will provide the training for all classroom and special education teachers.

In addition, the ESL  teacher will continue to attend professional developments offered by the Office of Language Learners .     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  The school administrators fully support the ELL teacher and all personnel that work with ELLs. They have made success for ELLs  a central issue in school, and they have made sure that the ESL program is well understood by all the staff.   They make sure ELLs have access to the full resources of the school. To accomplish this our school has created a cross- disciplinary schoolwide team that includes the ELL teacher, content-area teachers who teach English language learners, the  guidance counselor who specializes in the needs of ELLs, key school administrators, parent coordinator, and other staff. Such  team has a common planning period and meets regularly to align curriculum; plan integrated, cross-content projects; address  student concerns; and monitor student progress. School support staff (the librarian, social worker, technology leader, and so  on)  attend some meetings to ensure that ELLs have access to an array of learning resources and services.                    At MS 328, we hold weekly administration-initiated and/or teacher-initiated professional development workshops for all  teachers. We make sure that 15% of our professional development hours for the general education teachers are dedicated to  ESL strategies and methodologies. In addition, our ENL teacher spends 50% of his professional development hours attending  professional development seminars and workshops related to ENL curriculum and instruction throughout the academic year.         Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   At MS  328, we realize the importance of a strong home and school partnership. We work diligently to ensure that parents are  involved in our school. Parents are part of our Leadership Team.Our Parent Coordinator and Parent’s Association President  collaborate to increase parent involvement. Parents participate in different activities organized by the school or the Parent  Association such as meetings, parent-teacher conferences, workshops, school functions, homework assistance/tutoring, home  educational enrichment, decision making, and other aspects of our school governance. etc. Some of them volunteer to  chaperone on trips, field days, school dances, and other festivities. Parents of ELLs are oriented to the programs we offer as  well as programs offered by the NYCDOE. They are informed of the ELL policies as well as assessments, state standards, and  school expectations and policies. We communicate regularly with parents through our monthly school calendar and PA  meetings. The concerns of all parents are openly discussed during monthly School Leadership Team meetings as well.  Workshops are also conducted for the parents of ELLs to address their concerns. Bilingual staff is in attendance to provide  translation.  Parental notification of non English speaking parents is done through school personnel as mentioned above. The  Principal’s communications regarding rules, regulations as well as school information is done via translated memorandum. Our  Parent Coordinator and the family workers who are on the school premises are available during the day for the Spanish   2018-19 RSCEP-PF  112                                 speaking families. We also access the translation unit’s services for oral translation over the phone for languages other than  Spanish. In this manner we are able to communicate to our non-English parents and students. ELL parents receive phone calls  and letters from the ESL teacher that inform about the after school program and the student’s progress. The ESL teacher often  uses an over-the-phone interpreter when calling parents. The parent can arrange a meeting at any time to talk with the ESL  teacher about progress and goals for the student. We evaluate needs of parents through surveys and questionnaires in both  English and Spanish.We make sure that the activities are based on parental interest gathered from surveys and questionnaires  in both English and Spanish. This year in order to enhance student literacy development we will provide a series of literacy  workshops that actively engage parents in working directly with their children on literacy activities, e.g., teaching parents  reading and writing strategies so that they could support homework assignment/projects at home. Another workshop we like  to provide to the parents is teaching them how to use New York City as a resource. We will provide trips to expose parents to  the rich resources available to them as being residents of New York City, e.g., museums, public library, Broadway theaters etc.  By attending these workshops parents will be able to become more involved in helping their children improve their school  work.     We schedule  individual meeting with the parents of the ELL students. Also during Parent Teac her konferences We spend extra  time with the parents explaing the progress of their children in all subject  areas.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   We offer ENL classes for the parents .We invite them  during multicultural  shows,celebrations     Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 RSCEP-PF  114                                          Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   New Millenium Business Academy                                                                              School DBN: 09X328  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.

Copies of said information are shared with our Guidance Counselor, Parent  Coordinator, Community Coordinator, and others.   All written correspondence between the school and students’ families is provided in the language of their choice,  which most often is in their native language. As a result, we use the NYCDOE’s internal translation unit to provide  translations of all school correspondence in Arabic, Bengali, French, Haitian-Creole, and Spanish including:    a.

After  school the parent and all emergency contact on student's blue/emergency card will be contacted. School keep a  record of parent whose first language is not English and a emergency contact related to the family who is able to  communicated in the English language.             Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      The language access coordinator will hold 2 meetings throughout the school year in order to keep parents all staff  members informed of Chancellor's Regulation A-663 and all services provided by the Language Translation and  Interpretation Unit.           Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      Chancellor's Regulation A-663 is a directive on the responsibility that our school system is committed to for the  opportunity of equal access to all rights, opportunity, information, and participation of ELL's parents in our school. A  parent will never be denied access to opportunities afforded their families, or to children enrolled at our school. As a  result of these regulations, we have developed systems that will meet the needs of parents of ELLs who speak the  predominant second language, Spanish,…………….. and less prevalent languages represented in our school, such as  Arabic, Bengali, Fulani, Hausa, Mandinka , and Twi……………….    Additionally, Item B of Section VII in the Chancellor's Regulations relates to the conspicuous posting of DOE covered  languages for translation. This appears upon entry to the school near the Security Desk. The school's safety plan  provides that parents who need to communicate with the school, does so in their home language. This is determined  via the Parents Preferred Language Form, which is available as part of the Family Resources through the Office of ELLs.   All school based and consultant agencies will be utilized to this end, including community based organizations that will  be instrumental in meeting the language needs of our parents.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?
