This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Contextual Information about your school community:    Section 4: CEP Overview      All of the International High Schools in New York City follow the “Internationals Approach.” This approach is built  upon five core principles. These principles inform all aspects of our structure, pedagogy and curriculum, and include:   Heterogeneity and Collaboration    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      We strive to attract as diverse a student population as possible in terms of ethnicity, country of origin, native  language, race, gender, English proficiency and academic level. All of our classes are untracked and completely  heterogeneous. Our students speak 30 different languages and represent almost 40 nations. Students from the same  countries come from a wide range of urban and rural areas where schooling may be limited. Some are refugees or  asylum-seekers.    Research has shown that students learn best when they learn from each other. Thus in every class, students work  together in small cooperative learning groups. Only through working together can they complete the interdisciplinary  projects assigned to them. Through various extracurricular activities students have the chance to collaborate in new  and different ways.   Experiential Learning    Research has also shown that students learn best by doing. As a result, we support experiential learning, whereby  students have opportunities to grow academically and linguistically outside of the school’s four walls. These include  field trips, expanded learning opportunities and career internships.    BIHS has a comprehensive career internship program. All students in their junior year complete a ten-week long  intensive internship where they gain on-the-job experience, knowledge, and skills in order to prepare them for the  world of work. Students become aware of future possibilities as they acquire job skills while working in schools,  hospitals, courts, museums, law firms, computer labs, community-based organizations (CBOs), non-profits, and  private enterprise. We have found that the experience is so profound as to influence students’ choices of college  majors during the college application process.   Experiential learning also means “hands-on” activities, role-plays, and simulations, which occur in all content area  classes as a result of our teacher-designed, project-based curricula.    Language and Content Integration    Students at BIHS come to us with a wide range of academic and linguistic needs. We believe that language  development is achieved through interdisciplinary content area instruction while working in heterogeneous groups.  Learning and language are social constructs and in order to develop language proficiency, students need a sense of  purpose, a forum for negotiating meaning with each other, and an opportunity to demonstrate tangible results of  their learning. Interdisciplinary student-centered project-based instruction provides scaffolded accessibility for  students at different levels of proficiency ( including newcomers and students reading proficiently, SIFE students, long  term ENLs, and as an alternative placement to Special Education) , while making similar language and content area  connections across disciplines. These projects culminate in written and/or oral presentations in order to provide  numerous opportunities for our English language learners to use language in various settings. A wide range of  technology is integrated into all classes thus allowing students to use different modalities to demonstrate what they  know and can do.   In addition to developing students’ English language skills, we promote native language acquisition and literacy. We  have a collection of native language books in various languages that range from illustrated children’s books to novels  and textbooks on a variety of levels. Students complete native language projects in all grades, such as writing native  language/English children’s books and bilingual brochures about human rights violations in native countries, or about  U.S. citizens’ rights. The school supports after-school native culture clubs and cultural festivals. The clubs and festivals  affirm our students’ cultural identity which has proven to support academic development by providing a safe haven  for students and a welcoming and orienting community for newcomers.   Localized Autonomy    We believe that decisions about instruction, operations, and budget are best made by those who are closest to our  students – our staff. As a result, decisions are made collaboratively in a group where all constituencies of our learning   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      community are represented. As a PROSE school within the New York City Department of Education, we are fortunate  to have even greater flexibility in decision-making on a broader scale.   One Learning Model for All    Recognizing that everyone in our learning community is continually growing and acquiring new knowledge and skills,  our faculty adhere to the same principles that guide our classroom model of instruction. Teachers work  collaboratively in teams to plan, differentiate, and scaffold curriculum for all students. At weekly meetings, teachers  discuss the progress of their students and analyze data around teaching and learning to better meet the needs of  their students.   As part of our ongoing professional development, time is scheduled for teachers to visit one another’s classrooms to  learn from each another and reflect on practice. These targeted intervisitations optimize growth and development  among staff members. Our teachers have a great aptitude for reflecting upon their work and making appropriate  adjustments. They are skilled at both incorporating feedback into their projects and providing meaningful feedback to  one another. Additionally, in support of "One Learning Model for All," students, teachers, and school leaders  complete and present portfolios documenting their learning and growth over the course of the year.         2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    The Brooklyn International High School eagerly seeks out strategic collaborations and partnerships to further the  academic opportunities afforded our students. BIHS is affiliated with several community partners within the NYCDOE  including The Internationals Network for Public Schools, the New York Performance Standards Consortium, Mastery  Collaborative, Learning Partners (continuation grant), College Access for All, NYC Community Schools/Center for  Supportive Schools. Additionally, we have an extensive network of community partnerships which include  Morningside Center for Teaching Social Responsibility, Beam Center, Magic Box Productions, NYU, and College Now.      ● Over the past 25 years, BIHS has developed expanded learning opportunities for our students as we work with our  partners throughout the year and in various capacities during and after school. All students complete a ten-week  internship program at work sites throughout the city as a way of expanding learning beyond the four walls of the  school.    ● Additionally, in an effort to help students, families, and teachers develop a growth mindset and make the most out  of feedback, we will continue a 4th year partnership with the Mastery Collaborative, joining a team o f innovative  schools across the city to share and create resources to support mastery/competency-based learning and assessment.   ● Through a unique partnership the Office of Post Secondary Readiness, BIHS teachers teachers work with Beam  Center instructors (Connected Teaching Fellowship) to further develop their project development skills, as well as  technical skills in maker-related fields such as digital fabrication, electronics, craft, physical computing, mechanical  engineering, and other disciplines. Beam Center Instructors will support in-class implementation of the projects that  have been developed through Connected Teaching. Instructors will co-teach projects, providing instructional support  while exposing students to various professional fields (design, art, fabrication, architecture, contracting, etc.).   ● As a 4th year Learning Partners School, we will continue reflecting on and improving our circle practice to develop a  restorative justice program tailored to the needs of new immigrant English Language Learners.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      The Brooklyn International High School (BIHS) is a small learning community designed exclusively for recent immigrant  English Language Learners (ELLs). We serve approximately 350 students who come from over 40 different countries  and speak 30 different languages. We are a member of The Internationals Network for Public Schools (INPS), one of  fifteen such International high schools in the city and a member of the Performance Standards Consortium, one of  approximately 40 schools in New York City that use authentic performance-based assessment tasks. Both INPS and  the Consortium provide support and professional development for teachers.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   After reviewing the Framework for Great Schools Report 2018, feedback from our superintendent's office and  performing an internal needs assessment, we believe that our greatest progress has been in the area of collaborative  work amongst our teachers. By strategically budgeting and scheduling planning time, teachers are able to engage in  data analysis, curriculum design, and study groups in order to determine how to best meet their students’ needs.  Moreover, our participation in the Learning Partners Program allowed teachers to work collaboratively across schools  in our Learning Partners cohort.   Our review revealed that we would like to strengthen family ties and this will be our focus for the 2018-2019 school  year. Historically, we have had high attendance at our monthly family meetings and conferences, and high  participation in the family survey, but we would look forward to expanding the ways in which families can participate  in our school community.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 13K439   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   354   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     All teachers use multiple assessment measures to gauge student understanding and growth over time. We are a  project-based school, so within each project, students are provided with a variety of tasks designed to span the ability  levels and interest areas of our students. Teachers share curriculum with colleagues at team and discipline meetings  for feedback on multiple assessment measures. The professional development committee reviews assessment data  and designs professional development activities to assist teachers in using this data to improve instruction. This year  we will utilize Schoology, a Mastery Based Assessment Learning Management System, which aligns teachers’ formal  and informal assessments with tasks and allows for a more in depth analysis of assessment data. Monthly professional  development sessions will include professional development to ensure that teachers are using this platform  effectively.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33      Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.

Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Verify with an (X)   X              X   Column B   Section Reference(s)  Section 5,6,7,8              Section 5,6,7,8              1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34        Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.             Parent and Family Engagement Policy   The Brooklyn International High School   Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. 13K439, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children.

Community  Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and  family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in  Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health &  Wellness.    Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s)   How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student  academic outcomes?   The Community Schools Partnership has allowed us to expand our after school program and provide additional  supports for families and teachers.      Achievement Mentoring (provided by staff, Americorps and TLP staff) will continue to support social and   emotional learning, school engagement, and, in turn, daily attendance      Arts and youth development programming will engage students, promoting attendance     The STH/Foster Care grant provided by Children’s Village will provide students in temporary housing with   additional resources including counseling and mental health services     Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to  be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.    The goal for our community school is to maintain our high attendance rate of 90% and to increase student  participation in after school activities by 10% by June of 2019.      School will provide academic intervention supports for at least 30 weeks for at least 3 days per week by June  2019.   School will provide enrichment programs for at least 30 weeks for at least 3 days per week by June 2019.        25% of participants will participate in a community service project by June 2019.     Community members will be invited to participate in two events by June 2019.     50 family members will attend one workshop per year and 90% of Building Family workshop attendees will   rate it “good” or “excellent” by June 2019.     15 hours per week of expanded learning time will be provided by June 2019.     At least 45% of regular attendees will increase their math, ELA, and science skills through projects based   learning in a supportive learning environment.     65% of regular attendees will increase attendance, school engagement and behavior by June 2019.          Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Community School Annual Goal(s):  How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family  Engagement, and Health & Wellness--support your academic goals for students?  Academic success hinges on students health and well-being. Through our work with the community schools program,  we will expand learning time after school, strengthen our family supports and provide wrap around services such as  eye glasses, internet service, and other health care as needed.   By providing wraparound supports for students and families and making the school a place where students are  actively engaged and excited to be, students will be encouraged to attend school every day and will be met with the  supports they need to be successful.

Describe how the school will partner with the Lead CBO to do the following:  1.   Community Schools are expected to partner with a community-based partner organization (CBO) and  together with members of the School Leadership Team, hire a Community School Director. The Director will  lead implementation of the asset and needs assessment process, and other critically important coordinating  activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work.  Community Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and  services, as determined by the asset and needs assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time  (ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the  right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly  coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day.  Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to  strengthen this initiative.  Community Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and  families feel welcome, actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of  their schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community  School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this family engagement  strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work.  Community School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director,  select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual  students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use.  Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work.     2.   3.   4.   1.   1.  The full-time Community School Director (CSD) was hired in partnership with school leadership and  the SLT. The CSD is responsible for the day-to-day management of the community school strategy.  The CSD is a "community organizer,” facilitating and providing leadership for the collaborative  process of developing a continuum of services for children, families, and community members. The  CSD drives development of community school action plans and planning for sustainability. The CSD  tracks the school’s progress against performance goals, reviews school data, supports program  evaluation activities, and manages partnerships. The CSD will ensure that the community school  strategy is implemented at exceptional levels of quality with full support, buy-in, and regular  communication with stakeholders across the school community.

Data shows that 13% of our students  are categorized as advanced or proficient for the listening/speaking section whereas only 3% of  our students are categorized as advanced/proficient for the reading/writing sections. Because of  student need, throughout the 2018-19 school year, 5 ESL certified teachers will run reading and  writing workshops in English for a heterogeneous group of ENL students including newcomers,  SIFE and Long-Term ENLs - 100% of the instructional time will be ENL.

They discuss these issues learning domain specific vocabulary. Students internalize both  the vocabulary and concepts as they then develop workshops to teach other students about these  same issues. Students also facilitate these workshops at parent meetings in both English and  Native Language as well as at teacher professional development sessions. As Snow, Met and  Genesee (1989) discuss in their research, content provides real meaning that is an inherent  feature of naturalistic language learning. Consequently, students acquire language through this  service-learning model of teaching and become more conversant in English in addition to  increasing their academic presentation skills. This course is taught in English by a dually  certified teacher in ELA & ESL. The class will use many materials from Facing History and  teacher created materials from a variety of online resources that include adapted texts.

Each visit includes classroom visits as well as time to discuss and reflect on the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49         Part C: Professional Development   inquiry work and classroom implementation with ELLs.  Additionally, the Restorative Justice  team meets every other week to work separately on two cycles of inquiry.    Title III funds would partially fund the teachers for participation along with coverage for the  teachers who attend the Intervisitations. Dates have not yet been set for meetings, but Restorative  Justice team meetings are bi-monthly from September to June on Wednesdays from 3:05-5:05  for a total of 20 meetings and Intervisitations are monthly from September - May for a total of 9  visits. Usually 2 teachers and the AP attend the intervisitations.            Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact  higher achievement for ELLs.  NOTE: These are in addition to mandated activities, such as  parent orientation during ELL identification process.     rationale       schedule and duration      name of provider    how parents will be notified of these activities   topics to be covered   Begin description here:               Parental Engagement  While many families of English Language Learners cannot help their children directly with work  because of language barriers, the article “Building Collaboration between Schools and Parents of  English Language Learners: Transcending Barriers, Creating Opportunities,” argues that parents  of ELLs impact higher achievement of students in other ways, like actively participating in  parent teacher conferences and attending school based parent meetings (Delgado-Gaitian 1990;  Goldenberg 2004 in Waterman and Harry 2008). Therefore, our goal for the 2018-19 school year  is to engage families in meaningful ways because their engagement in our school utlimately  increases the achievement of our ELLs. As such, the Parent Coordinator conducts a needs  assessment of ELL parents to determine which CBOs to invite and which topics to cover at  monthly parent meetings that will increase parent engagement to ultimately increase student  achievement for ELLs. All information sent to parents of ELLs regarding these meetings is  translated, printed and mailed home. Also, we purchase a subscription to School Messenger,  which telephones parents of ELLs in their native languages to remind and inform them of parent  teacher conferences and parent meetings. In addition, we pay translators to stay during the  meetings so parents of ELLs have access to important information to help their children succeed.  They use a device in which they speak and parents have headphones so they can easily hear the  correct language. We purchase batteries periodically for these 50 devices. We also purchase food  for these meetings (within the allotted $250) as well as metro cards for ELL parents who cannot  otherwise afford to attend.    Meetings are generally held monthly on the third Thursday of the month. Topics specific to  ELLs at these 2 hour supplemental monthly meetings that last from 6:00pm - 8:00pm include:    1 - October and December - College Prep, College Application, and Financial Aid Processes  (specific to immigrant and ELL issues). These workshops are geared to help the parents of our  ELLs prepare students for college by explaining the process of SATs, and resources available,  like free SAT prep classes, as well as how to navigate the college application system and to learn   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50         Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    necessary vocabulary needed to apply for financial aid to colleges. We also disperse information  like which colleges have support systems for ELL students. These workshops are facilitated by  our Guidance Counselor, Ken Kastenbaum in conjunction with a certified ESL teacher, Laura  Alcazar.      2 - January and June - Mentoring and College Readiness - These workshops will focus on ELL  student progress towards graduation and the extra help opportunities and extra curricular  activities available to support our ELL students. The concentration will be on how parents of  ELLs can help their Beginner and Intermediate students pass the ELA exam and become college  ready.      ELL parents are invited to school events, college visits, and other trips to encourage  communication between the school and home, which will ultimately improve student  achievement. We do so using School Messenger.      Additionally, most of our ELL students are newcomers, so many of their parents do not  understand how college works in America. Therefore, parents often cannot give their children  adequate support when trying to apply for or choose colleges. In order for us to provide students  with supplemental guidance, we organize several college trips throughout the year for which we  need buses. Two trips are tentatively planned for April although exact dates are to be decided.  Parents attend as both chaperones and to learn about the process for themselves.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Teachers rely on NYSITEL and NYSESLAT to understand where students are in their language development and then use  teacher-created formative assessments with Common Core aligned rubrics to guide instructional planning for ELLs.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   We have grade level interdisciplinary teams that create alignment among the types of assessments and rubrics. We also have  cross-grade discipline teams to create vertical alignment across grades in terms of the standards teachers are assessing.  Disciplinary teams use the Common Core aligned Consortium PBAT rubrics to align standards.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The success of our program is measured through the analysis of a wide array of data sources, including:   •     Graduation rate  •     Course pass rate  •     Regents pass rate  •     Attendance rates  •     Learning Environment Survey – student results  •     Learning Environment Survey – parent results  •     Learning Environment Survey – teacher results  •     Dropout rate  •     Student anecdotals     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    In addition to the grade level teams and cross-grade discipline teams, we also have a counseling team and a professional  development committee, all of whose members contribute to decisions around interventions and school-wide practices.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   We are not a K-5 school.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   We use our graduation rate, EDAT, NYSESLAT and ELA Regents data along with PBAT and Portfolio rubrics as outcome  assessments to inform our ELL programming.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   In addition to the grade level teams and cross-grade discipline teams, we also have a professional development committee, full  faculty meetings to discuss this data and make decisions around our programs.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Instruction at our school is delivered collaboratively by interdisciplinary teams of five to six teachers (Math, Science,  Social Studies, ESL/English, Art and Physical Education) who work to plan instruction for groups of approximately 80- 100 students who are broken down into classes of about 20-25 students. Each group of students is block programmed  and those students travel together throughout the day.  Within their blocks 9th and 10th grade students are  mixed.  The blocks are heterogeneous but at various times teachers may choose to group students within the block  homogeneously if that suits the students’ and block’s needs for a specific project. Instruction in stand-alone ENL  develops English language skills so students can succeed in core content courses.  We also offer several integrated  ENL courses to build English language skills through content area instruction.  These courses are taught by dual  certified instructors.  Students get a mix of free standing and integrated ENL courses according to their levels so their  courseload meets the CR-154 requirements.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55         b.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              All students are carefully programmed to be certain they have the mandated number of ENL and ELA instructional  minutes each year with Entering getting a minimum of 540 minutes of ENL per week, Emerging 360 minutes of ENL per week,  and Transitioning and Expanding receiving 180 minutes of ENL.  Former ELLs also receive more than the minimum of a half  credit of ENL.  Each instructional team includes at least two teachers who are licensed in ESL.  HLA usage/support is included  for 25% of the instructional time for all ELLs.  Teachers design curriculum so that all students have multiple opportunities to  read, write, speak and listen in their home languages.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      Within each interdisciplinary team, there are at least two ESL teachers, many of whom are dual certified.  Each  interdisciplinary team has time each week for team meetings to discuss curriculum and student progress.  Curriculum is  designed with the International's Approach in mind, so teachers mostly use heterogeneous, collaborative groups to foster  language development.  They also design experiential projects and teach language through content.  Many teams design  interdisciplinary projects so language is repeated in the various content classes to reinforce its use. Most teachers have  attended QTEL and INPS training, so they employ strategies like Jigsaws and Pre, During and Post Reading Activities to build  background knowledge. They also differentiate by offering choice in both how a student learns (video, leveled reading, native  language texts, etc.) as well as how a student shows his/her learning (posters, paragraph, essays, song, use of native language,  recording, etc.).  Teachers also use various scaffolds like pictures, sentence starters and graphic organizers to make content  comprehensible and help students produce written work. The ESL teachers consult with non-ESL teachers during the team  meetings to help provide strategies.  Furthermore, all teachers receive high quality professional development throughout the  year from qualified providers like INPS, WestEd, and other licensed ESL teachers. Because of the differentiation and scaffolding  needed, teachers develop the materials using resources like Newsela, Brainpop, Khan Academy, GapMinder, and  Desmos.  Literature includes books like To Kill a Mockingbird, The Color Purple, 12 Angry Men, The Giver, The Hunger Games,  and many more.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      Because of the multitude of languages present in our school, we do not evaluate ELLs in their home languages.  However,  home language use is encouraged in various projects throughout the year and students are asked to present projects in home  language to family members.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Heterogeneity is one of the Five Core Principles of the Internationals Approach espoused by all  International High Schools.  As  a result, students are not tracked or separated based on academic ability, linguistic ability, race, ethnicity, grade level, age,  gender, or membership in an ELL subgroup – students are heterogeneously mixed in all of their content area classes.  Teachers  must differentiate their project-based curricula so that the needs of students at all levels are met.  This occurs in a variety of  ways in all content area classrooms:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      •     Layered Curriculum – students have a wide array of choices for completing activities that lead to understanding of a  particular content skill, theme or topic; project choices incorporate a wide range of learning styles and “intelligences.”   •     Leveled Reading Materials – students can study the same topics and concepts but explore them at their varied reading  levels; we have literature as well as textbooks at multiple reading levels. Teachers can also use websites like NEWSELA to get  leveled current events articles.   •     Jigsaw Readings – readings covering a class topic are divided among students so that all are reading text at their level;  students must then “jigsaw” and meet with students who have read different texts and share their knowledge orally, then  collectively answer questions about the material presented through all of the text.   •     Collaborative Group Work on Projects – students working together on group projects complete different aspects of the  task according to either their skill level, linguistic level or personal preference; all are given a pivotal role geared toward their  strengths so that all may be successful and contribute to the completion of the project.       6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Teachers use the UDL, DOK, and QTEL tools to evalualte their curriculum.  These tools were all designed to differentiate the  needs of all learners, including SWD and ELLs.  By differentiating and scaffolding, teachers provide access to academic content  and accelerate English language development.  See Questions 3 & 6 for more specific details of differentiation and scaffolding.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  ELL-SWDs are in the least restrictive environment because they are in their block scheduled classes with all other students  made up of ELLs and Former ELLs.  The interdisciplinary team of teachers meet regularly with Related Service providers who  help teachers with indirect service to make sure that academic work meets the needs of each child.  Students have the option  of push-in or pull-out SETSS.  Some students want to stay in class but receive extra help, while other students want separate  one-on-one help without classmates seeing it.  Thus, at the IEP meetings, the CSE, along with the parents and students, decide  together whether push-in or pull-out services will best serve both the academic and socio-emotional needs of each student.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Grade level teachers in conjunction with administration, guidance, and the literacy coach, review student work at grade level  teacher team meetings.  If the student has an IEP, the special education teacher is also included.  After reviewing classroom  assessments, along with essential data about years of service, SIFE status, and guardian concerns, grade level teacher teams  speak with the student to help develop intervention plans.  For ELLs During school, we offer the following:  1 -English support once a week for Beginner ELLs and SIFE.  2 - Math support once a week for students struggling in Math as identified by teachers.  3 - Small group mentoring by licensed teachers to help students complete graduation projects.   Our after school program includes a series of targeted interventions geared towards supporting all of our ELL  subgroups.  Targeted students are encouraged by teachers, administrators and guidance counselors to attend appropriate  classes or clubs to improve their academic performance.  Students are encouraged to use both English and their native  languages in all programs.  Teachers running these programs utilize the “Internationals Approach”:   French Heritage Language Program (in collaboration with the French Embassy) – this two-hour weekly program supports  native language literacy for our francophone ELLs. This class is taught in French  Literacy Enrichment (one class for 11th Grade and one class for 12th Grade)  Math Enrichment (Calculus - 12th Grade)  Basic Math Support (11th Grade)        9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      11th grade is a big transition for students because many students are still Emerging as English Language Learners and need  extra support. Therefore, we will offer extra ESL push-in and/or pull-out support for Entering/Emerging ELLs along with SIFE  students. This same teacher will work with content teachers to differentiate curriculum according to student need.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We never had a bilingual program.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Since the majority of our students are ELLs, all school programs are “equal access.” In addition to the support and intervention  services listed in the answer to question eight of this section, we have the following after-school classes; while they may not all  be “academic” in theme, all of them are designed to continue students’ language development through activities incorporating  listening, speaking, reading, and writing of English.  All programs are run by certified teachers.

Mentoring        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Since all teachers design their own project-based curricula, there are too many instructional materials to name individually; all  teachers draw from multiple sources in compiling classroom curricula and materials.  Some examples include:  QTEL Institute curricula  Anti-Defamation League: A World of Difference  Facing History, Facing Ourselves  Brain Pop! Videos in multiple content areas  New York Historical Society  Brooklyn Academy of Music  Technology (school has 1:1 laptop computers plus 2 computer labs):  iMovie, Final Cut Pro (digital video cameras)  Garageband (digital voice recorders)  iPhoto (digital cameras)  Powerpoint  MS Word, Excel, PowerPoint  SMART Board  iWork  iBook  Khan Academy  NEWSELA  ColorinColorado   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   All of our students participate in our language development/ENL program.  All of our classes use the native language to  support learning.  The locus of control over language use resides with our students and they use both English and their native  languages to discover and develop content.  Some projects every year are done in the native languages and in English and  students are supported in developing their native languages to the greatest extent possible.  Peers, community partners,  family members and/or school personnel support students.  We also have an extensive native language library with a wide  selection of fiction and non-fiction books from which our students can choose.  Furthermore, teachers and students use native  language materials from online resources. Students take advantage of these resources several times throughout the day.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Since all of our students are ELLs and Former ELLs, curriculum and resources are designed specifically to meet their academic  and socio-emotional needs.  All curriculum is differentiated to meet the needs of the heterogenous level of ELLs and  SWDs.  Therefore, materials correspond with students' age and grade levels but are appropriate to each student's cognitive  needs.  For example, one assignment might be to write a paragraph.  The teacher might have 3 versions: one with sentence  starters, one fill in the blank and one with a word bank, so all students are working on the same content but the student can  access it according to both language and cognitive needs. We use a wide array of resources in our school including teacher- made materials, textbooks on a range of levels, trade books at many reading levels, and a large variety of non-text hands-on  materials.  In addition, our school has wireless access in all classrooms and students use the Internet to access resources with  the guidance of teachers. With the teacher evaluation system, Administration ensures that all curricular materials are  appropriate for the ELLs that we serve.  Furthermore, teachers engage in curriculum shares, team meetings and  interdisciplinary meetings, aligning curriculum both horizontally across grade level and vertically from one grade to the  next.  Administration is also present at these meetings.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    We operate as separate entities and do not share ELL resources.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Prior to the start of the school year, new students are assigned to heterogeneous teams with, as far as practicable, students  who speak their native language.  The new students are then paired with more experienced students who are responsible for  escorting them to class and lunch, making sure they know how to get home, explaining school rules and customs, and acting as  their translator and advocate in class.  A new family orientation meeting is held annually in June to welcome new students to  our school and to inform them about our school structure and activities.  When students arrive throughout the year, they meet  the Guidance Counselor, Ken Kastenbaum as well as the Parent Coordinator, Lilian Ghali, and the Literacy Coach, Patricia  Doherty.  These are the people mainly in charge of the ELL identification process, so if students have questions, they have met  three staff members in addition to teachers.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    French Heritage Language Program (in collaboration with the French Embassy in NYC) – this two-hour weekly program  supports native language literacy for our francophone (West African and Haitian) ELLs. This class is taught in French.       18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   We do not offer a dual language program.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59            Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  All of our students are English Language Learners or Former ELLs, so our Professional Development focuses specifically on  meeting their academic and socioemotional needs. The teachers at BIHS participate in various professional development  activities including intervisitations within our own school as well as at other international schools and collaborating with  outside institutions such as INPS, QTEL, Apple, Columbia University, NYU, The Dolan DNA Learning Center, World Science  Festival, The Museum of the City of New York, New York Historical Society, Facing History and Ourselves, Teachers College,  Weill Cornell Medical College, Theater Development Fund, Tolerance Center, International Rescue Committee, National  Endowment for the Humanities, BRIC (Digital Storytelling), The Tenement Museum, Royal Shakespeare Company, Magic Box  (animations), BEAM Center (digital fabrication and technology).  These professional development experiences allow teachers  to enhance curriculum and connect our students with the surrounding community through field trips and guest speakers.     Teachers at The Brooklyn International High School participate in weekly interdisciplinary team professional development as  well as monthly discipline-based professional development.  In addition, BIHS conducts monthly professional development  meetings for all faculty.  Our Professional Development Committee meets weekly to plan professional development.     The following are the various types of professional development we offer. All curriculum is Common Core aligned, so  intervisitations, curriculum shares, and team meetings help teachers develop common core learning standards.     Contracted Vendor Professional Development  Morningside Center for Teaching Social Responsibility (Restorative Justice through the NYCDOE)  Since this is not ELL specific, we have partnered with Flushing International High School and International High School at  Lafayette through Learning Partners, to learn how they have implemented Restorative Justice Approaches for ELLs. Between  the three schools all of which serve ELLs, there will be several intervisitations.  Also, the Learning Partner team from our school  is made of one ESL certified teacher, along with one ESL/ELA dual certified teacher, a Science teacher and a dual certified  ESL/Social Studies teacher.  Therefore, all professional development from Morningside can be adapted for ELLs by the  expertise of the Learning Partners Team.       Mastery Collaborative - This professional development will be given to a team including the Principal, and a teacher certified in  Dance as well as a dual certified ESL/Math teacher.  Therefore, anything turnkeyed will have been adapted for the needs of  ELLs.     In-House Professional Development  Intervisitations - In order to foster collaboration among teachers, each teacher will have the opportunity to observe another  teacher during the year.  Each visit will include both a pre and post meeting with the host teacher to discuss classroom  strategies and student outcomes.  Common Planning Time – Teachers on the same team meet weekly to plan interdisciplinary units, share curriculum and share  information about inquiry projects.     Other Professional Development  Intervisitations – one teacher from each team will visit one of our sister International High Schools to learn from their  successes and struggles.  The visiting teacher will debrief with other staff members.  INPS - summer training and Election Day PD     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  All professional development at our school is focused on ELL training since the majority of our students (and all of our newly  admitted students) are ELLs.  The professional development program described in question one above provides multi-year, on- going professional development for all members of the faculty.  Even if teachers participated only in the in-school professional  development – the bare minimum for our teachers – they would be participating in a minimum of eighty hours of professional  development a year.  In addition, our school participates in professional development organized by Internationals Network for  Public Schools, including intervisitations, summer and Election Day professional development, and a variety of inter-school  project-based learning opportunities. Agendas and attendance are kept digitally in shared folders on Google Docs for all  meetings and Professional Development workshops.  If teachers attend professional development outside of the school, they  submit agendas to our Business Manager who files them in teacher folders in the main office.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Interdisciplinary teacher teams will use family engagement time (40 minutes per week) to reach out to families and arrange  one-on-one meetings to discuss student progress. Teachers will call home to arrange meetings, with the help of staff members  who can translate.  They will give a choice of times that best suits the availability of parents.  We have a multilingual staff, so  teachers will create appointments in a shared school calendar in Google Drive, including the staff member who is needed for  translation to make sure someone is available. Teachers will keep notes of these meetings in their team folders on Google  Drive, which is shared with all teachers on the team as well as Guidance and Administration. In the event that we cannot reach  the parent by phone, teachers will send home letters that are translated by the DOE Translation Services, when possible.     2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   With the  Family Engagement time in the NYC teacher contracts, interdisciplinary teacher teams engage families in different  ways including positive phone calls home in September and team newsletters that introduce teachers and share  curriculum.  Teams also ask students to present projects to parents in native language and invite parents to these  presentations.  Furthermore, one team gives a weekly assignment including family input. Our parent coordinator also  encourages parents to become involved in our school community by sending home monthly mailings in PPL and organizing  monthly meetings staffed with translators.  Monthly family association meetings are designed to inform the parents about  school events and to help them adjust to life in America.  Each meeting has a theme such as “Know Your Rights,”  “Understanding the College Process,” “Health Fair,” and “How to Help with Homework.”  The content and themes of the  meetings are selected specifically with the needs of immigrant families in mind.  On-staff translators and student assistants  translate all content into several languages including Bengali, Chinese, Wolof, French, Spanish, Haitian Creole and  Fulani.  Attendance at these meetings is generally very high with 50-100 families in attendance.   Our parents are also  encouraged to accompany the students on trips to colleges and to attend our International Feast. Anywhere from 20-30% of  our students’ families regularly attend Open School Night and Open School afternoon. In addition to this, parents are made  aware of translation services available both through the orientation and intake process in addition to the welcome posters  posted at the entrance to the building as well as outside our main office.  Our parent welcome center also has many resources  in multiple languages.              2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61      Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Kathleen Rucker, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   BIHS                                                                              School DBN: 13K439  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      The data used to assess language preferences of our family community are culled from a variety of sources. We  use the Parent Preferred Language (PPL) form gathered from student permanent records and from those filled out  by parents when students enter the NYC schools for the first time. We also utilize information gathered from Part  III of the Home Language Survey (HLIS), ATS reports, and Student Emergency Contact cards. The Parent  Coordinator gathers this information, so we can provide all parents with written translation and oral  interpretations through all means available to us.

Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       We will ask our families for feedback on an ongoing basis. All of our students are new to English and all of our families  speak languages other than English, so we continually seek feedback on our translation & interpretation services.  Additionally, our parent coordinator keeps an ongoing dialogue with families so they can feel comfortable giving our  school feedback.            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69
