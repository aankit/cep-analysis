This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      As inquisitive learners, we grow through perseverance, resilience, and innovation. We believe that, to act with  integrity and empathy, we have a responsibility to advocate for ourselves and others, honoring our community and  the world.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    We are a diverse and inclusive environment in which students achieve highly. On the 2015-16 School Quality Guide  we were Well Developed in all categories except “Assessment,” in which we were Proficient. At least four out of six  classes on each grade are co-taught ICT classes, so that our students with disabilities (20% of our student population)  are nurtured and supported in a fully integrated environment. Eighth graders have the opportunity to take up to three  Regents classes, and 100% of those who sit for exams succeed in passing. Last year, we de-tracked the Living  Environment Regents course, and all of our 8th graders took the exam. 95% of students passed the Living  Environment exam. We are in the process of de-tracking our Mathematics curriculum so that, in the 2018-19 school  year, all 8th graders will take the Algebra Regents course. 100% of our teachers received overall ratings of either  Effective or Highly Effective for the 2015-16 school year. 98% of our families reported on the NYC School Survey that  they are “satisfied with the education their child has received.”    We are innovative in our development of both curriculum and instruction, across subjects, with our Exploration  Program lying at the heart of this innovation. Our courses engage students in real-world inquiry and learning. All  students complete in-depth Exit Projects each year in Social Studies and Science, and eighth graders complete a  student-developed service learning project before graduation. In service learning projects, students worked on public  health campaigns, community beautification, and service to homeless New Yorkers. As part of our focus on student  centered learning, we use portfolios and student led conferences instead of traditional parent-teacher conferences.    Our teachers have leveraged the Common Core Learning Standards to develop robust units and assessments. We  have developed CC-aligned “in book” reading assessments that provide deeper understanding of middle school  students’ literacy needs than running records. Information gathered from these assessments, as well as common pre-  and post-assessments and formative checks for understanding, help teachers to engage together in meaningful  reflection on and adjustment of their instruction and curriculum.   Finally, our school climate reflects our emphasis on social-emotional learning and community. Through a partnership  with Morningside Center, we strengthened our advisory program, equipping our students with skills in self-advocacy,  conflict resolution, organization, and positive leadership. We have a strong peer mediation program and a strong  student government, which develop and value student voice. Diversity in the community is a prioritized topic of  investigation, discussion and celebration through such events as our annual Peace and Diversity Conference and  Upstander Day. In 2015-16, also worked on an ongoing basis with Border Crossers to facilitate difficult and honest  conversations about race among the adults in school, so that we can think about how to have those conversations  with all members of our community. These conversations continued within staff affinity groups in 2017-18, and  resulted in the development of student groups such as Pretty Brown Girl. In their time here, our students enjoy  positive and healthy relationships with peers and adults.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   We have a significant special education population, with approximately 20% of our students having IEPs. Two to four  classes on each grade are ICT classes specially designated for high-functioning students with autism through the ASD- Nest program. An additional two sections are traditionally co-taught ICT classes, many of whom with learning  disabilities. We also have significant numbers of students receiving Resource Room/SETSS, and some receiving related  services (for occupational therapy, physical therapy, or counseling). Beginning in 2016-17, we re-designed our  admissions policies as part of the DOE's diversity in enrollment initiative, and now accept students across academic  range and with a 30% priority for those eligible for FRL. Lastly, we have a number of English Language Learners,  ranging in progress from Emerging to Commanding, who need and receive language support both stand-alone and in  the context of content classes.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Over the course of the 2017-18 school year, a major focus was Rigorous Instruction with particular attention to  Response to Intervention (RTI) and AIS. We implemented a full RTI/AIS program, addressing student need in a timely  and effective manner. This year, our goal is to capitalize on and further that growth, and move into year two of this  plan.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 15K447   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   528   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. The Math and Science Exploratory School, in compliance with the Section  1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a  parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school  and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning  and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on  the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed  members of the school community.       Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   The Math and Science Exploratory School will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;  ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and  decision making in support of the education of their children;  ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress;  ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;  ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;  ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35   Parental Involvement and School Quality      The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:  ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s  Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the  school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies  as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the  Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical  support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;   ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of  the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming  and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for  parents each month and file a report with the central office.;  ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational  accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support  services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;   ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality  Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;  ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents  of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be  involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other  applicable sections under the Elementary and Secondary (ESSA) Act;  ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the  morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the  Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions;  ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;   ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;     The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;  ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;  ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;  ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;  ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;  ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;  ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about  school activities and student progress;  ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.     School-Parent Compact (SPC)   The Math and Science Exploratory School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student  Succeeds Act (ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of  student achievement between the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities  and programs funded by Title I, agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students  will share responsibility for improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership  will be developed to ensure that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  MS 447 uses many types of assessments to determine ELL early literacy skills including Fountas and Pinnell reading levels,  TCRWP, school-based baseline assessments, and teacher created in book assessments.  The data gathered from these  assessments help us assess the needs of ELLs in conjunction with current content, the common core and additional resources.  The data allows us to better understand our ELLs learning processes, whether they are making progress, and how much  progress.  The data also shows what their weaknesses are and what the teachers need to target.  The 2016-2017 school year  shows a decrease of ELLs, however, we expect more ELLs to be admitted for the 2017-2018 school year.  ELLs from the 2016- 2017 school year, tested out or returned to their home country.  Other Former ELLs receive one more year of ELL services and  accommodations. The school puts all ELLs in the same class by grade to allow the ENL provider to plan her schedule  better.  Generally, many of our ELLs enter MS 447 as expanding learners of English. The one exception is a sixth grader who  entered mid-year and came in as entering. Putting all the ELLs together allows the ELL provider to plan for the school year.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   In order to support the teachers supporting ELLs, the teachers are trained on each of the assessment methods. Every year  teachers at 447 are taught to norm for exams and assessments to ensure that they grade accurately based on the students'  abilities. For ELLS in particular, the ENL teacher is responsible for assessing the ELLs.  If there are too many ELLs for the ENL  teacher to support then the ELA teacher would assess the students in order to support each other and ensure that everything  is completed in a timely manner.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  MS 447 evaluates our programs for ELLs in multiple ways.  State exam scores for exams such as the NYSESLAT and ELA are used  to determine the growth of our ELLs language acquisition.  Portfolios are used as a tool to track student growth. The  progression of ELLs in their general education classes is also an indicator of their success.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once the summative data is gathered, parents are notified of the results and an evaluation takes place with the school. If an  ELL shows limited home language proficiency and there is little progress in the ELLs language acquisition process, then the RTI  process begins. At MS 447, student concerns are brought up at each grade meeting and all teachers discuss any noticings  about the student's academics are brought up at that time. The SETTS teacher will then work with that student and chart their  progress. During the next few grade team meetings there are updates about the student's academic progress. If little progress  is made, then step two of the RTI process will be initiated.  This process continues unless progress is made or the student is  evaluated and determined to need an IEP.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   During the RTI process, the school also takes into consideration a number of situations including number of years of  instruction, English/home language literacy, SIFE status, parental request, etc.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The data patterns show that majority of our ELLs enter as advanced/expanding either on the NYSITELL or the NYSESLAT.  This  reflects that our students have a working knowledge of English prior to coming to MS 447. The students have had classes in  English prior to their arrival in the country, but not enough to be considered Commanding. Generally, they test out within a  year or two of services, but are still served for two years after testing Commanding. This year there is an Entering ELL from the  Dominican Republic. We expect her to do well at MS 447 because she has demonstrated outstanding motivation. In the future,  we anticipate there to be more ELLs, as MS 447 actively tries to change the population by accepting students from more  diverse populations.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   MS 447 communicates through g-mail with all teachers.  We have MS447.org e-mail addresses and the e-mails are joined with  Google sheets, Google docs. At the beginning of the year, the ENL teacher creates a spreadsheet of all the ELLs by grade. All  their relevant information is on the spreadsheet including level, testing accommodations, OSIS numbers, parent contact  information, home language etc. This spreadsheet is included for testing accommodations, in order to create a central place to  have all students with any testing accommodations. This ensures that all students are serviced.         Part IV: ELL Programming     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43      Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   At MS 447, the school follows a six day rotating schedule. The days are named A-F and the students follow the  schedule for that letter day.  In the Freestanding ENL program students are currently at an expanding English  proficiency level.  Those students with an expanding proficiency receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL services in ELA  or another content area. Depending on which letter day the students will receive ENL services based on their  schedule. In the future, students who receive a commanding will get 90 minutes of ENL or other content area.  For  Intermediate/Transitioning students, they will receive 90 of integrated ENL/ELA or content area and 90 minutes that  is flexible.  Students who are at the Emerging level will receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL, 90 minutes of  standalone and 90 flexible minutes. The students are separated by grade and level.  The classes travel together as a  group and in homogeneous proficiency levels.  For Entering ELLs they receive 360 minutes of ENL services.  One unit  or 180 would be integrated ENL and the second unit would be stand-alone ENL services.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     n/a    c.  DL program.  If applicable.      n/a       2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   The school ensures the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each program  model by allowing the ELL provider to work closely with the ELA teachers and the content area teachers ensuring that the  mandated hours are met. There are five proficiency levels, Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding, and  Commanding.  For Entering ELLs, they receive 2 units of ENL instruction per week, which equals to 360 total minutes, 180 is  standalone, and 180 is integrated ENL/ELA. For Emerging ELLS, they also receive 2 units, but 90 are stand alone, 180 are  integrated, ENL/ELA, and 90 are stand alone or integrated ENL with ELA or another content area. For Transitioning ELLs, they  receive one unit or 180 minutes per week.  90 is integrated ENL/ELA and 90 is flexible standalone or integrated ENL/ELA or  content area. For Expanding, they receive one unit.  180 are integrated ENL/ELA or other content area. Commanding receive .5  unit which is 90 integrated ENL/ELA or other content area. During programming, ELLs are grouped together with students that  share similar home languages, when possible.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   ELLs whose home language is Spanish are initially evaluated in Spanish with the Spanish Lab. Entering ELLs are encouraged to  use their home language in language acquisition. In class they are allowed to use bilingual dictionaries, google translate and a  multitude of other bilingual resources. They can read in their own language. Books and articles are chosen by both the teacher  and the students to ensure that the language and material are appropriate for the student and the class.        5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44      c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    5a. There are no SIFE students at MS 447 at this time.  However, in the past, the ENL teacher at MS 447 works closely with the  Academic Intervention Specialist and the SETTS teacher to work on specific skills and strategies need of all students requiring  additional support.  A separate focus program would be used to target SIFE students. Since SIFE students often have large gaps  in their language proficiency and knowledge base, SIFEs are taught to learn and practice skills for academia.  Strategies in  reading, phonics, vocabulary and writing that may have been taught in earlier grades would be used in conjunction to a  program, such as the Wilson Reading Program.  SIFE students are also paired with a student that can assist in social language  development, organization and assignments in other classes.    5b. Newcomers are paired with proactive English-speaking students in their class who enjoy helping their peers.  This is a  mutual relationship where both students benefit from each other.  Through their peers newcomers learn the nuances of  American culture in the school environment.  Their peers in turn, are exposed to the perspective of a newcomer.  Newcomers  also receive services that enhance the way their peers learn.  Newcomers are literate in their native language and are able to  transfer their knowledge to English.  Both newcomers and long term ELLs receive sheltered English content  instruction.  Scaffolding techniques, schema building, modeling, and bridging are essential as ELLs learn academic concepts in  another language.    5c. At MS 447, ELLs who have been receiving services for about four to six years will focus on developing their CALP, in  addition to scaffolded instruction.  CALP is necessary for both language acquisition and successful academic  development.  Language learners who have been acquiring language for about four to six years learn the social and functional  parts of language first, or Basic Interpersonal Communicative Skills (BICS).  Though people acquire language at different rates,  as teachers, we are responsible for ensuring students develop their BICS.  By emphasizing the development of academic  reading, writing, listening and speaking skills ELLs will be prepared for high school.  It is essential that ELLs are supported in  their classes so that they will become successful, acquire English and transition out of ENL.    5d. We focus on the development of academic language for long time ELLs.  The challenge with long-term ELLs is correcting the  fossilized errors that developed.  Fossilized errors are corrected through explicit instruction.  MS 447 currently does not have  any long-term ELLs.     5e. The plan for supporting former ELLs is to group them with ELLs when the ENL provider is pushing into their classes.  The  ENL   provider can provide extra support during group work and during reading and writing conferences.  This ensures that the  former ELLs are still supported in their classes.  During state exams, former ELLs are entitled to testing accommodations of  time and a half and small groups for up to two years.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   The instructional strategies and grade-level materials used to address the needs of ELL-SWDs include the development of  content area vocabulary, phonics instruction,  reading conferences, leveled texts, non-fiction reading strategies, and using  graphic organizers. The school ensures ELL-SWDs receive all their mandated services on their IEPs by putting ELL-SWDs in ICT  classes, if specified.  The ELL Provider can go into the content area classes. There are additional SETTS services available in ELA  and Math, for the students that require a less restrictive environment.  All related services are located within the school  building.  IEPs are followed strictly. There are no ELL-SWDs whose IEP mandates bilingual instruction.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  MS 447 modifies the curriculum by having the content area teachers collaborate with the ENL and SETTS providers. MS 447  uses a mix of push-in and pull out both one-on one and in small group settings, in order to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their  IEP goals. MS 447 is an inclusion model school, which allows for majority of classes to be co-taught. When partial special  education services is needed, flexible programming is provided, for example, part-time ICT can be arranged. This allows the ICT   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      teachers to work with the non-disabled peers while the SETTSS teacher can target smaller populations. ELL-SWD are placed in  ICT classes based on their IEPs and the annual meeting with their providers, guidance counselor, and parents to see what their  needs will be for the upcoming year. The ENL teacher will integrated into the classroom, as mandated.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Implications for LAP in English Language Arts:*  Collaboration with content area and ENL teachers to develop a community of  learning that is aligned with the Common Core.*  Be familiar with the academic performance of each ELL by analyzing  data.*  Allow opportunities for students to participate in conversation that develops their academic language.*  Provide high- interest, low level independent reading books for ELLs.* Ensure that all language modalities are incorporated during lessons  using a varietly of methods including group collaboration and daily journal writing. *  Create a print rich environment, using  ESL dictionaries in an ELA classroom.*  Analyze data of ELLs to become informed about the academic performance of each  ELL. *  ELLs can read in their native language, if needed.  *  Bilingual dictionaries are used. Implications for LAP in Social Studies  Content Area:*  Collaboration with content area and ENL teachers to develop a community of learning that is aligned with the  Common Core.*  Be familiar with the academic performance of each ELL by analyzing data.*  Allow opportunities for students  to participate in conversation that develops their academic language.*  Create a print rich environment, using ENL dictionaries  in a Social Studies classroom.*  Translated texts are provided for ELLs, as needed while responses are written in English or  Native language depending on level. * Provide content vocabulary support.* Ensure all language modalities are incorporated  during lessons using a variety of methods including group collaboration and daily journal writing.*  Analyze data of ELLs to  become informed about the academic performance of each ELL.*Bilingual dictionaries are used. Implications for LAP in  Mathematics Content Area:*  Collaboration with content area and ESL teachers to develop a community of learning that is  aligned with the Common Core.*  Be familiar with the academic performance of each ELL by analyzing data.*  Allow  opportunities for students to participate in conversation that develops their academic language in math, like using English in  word problems and collaborative group work.*  Allow students to communicate their problem solving skills in Math.*  Analyze  data of ELLs to become informed about the academic performance of each ELL.*  Incorporate writing in the math  lesson.*  Analyze students' mathematical strengths and weaknesses in order to drive and differentiate instruction.   * Bilingual  dictionaries are used. Implications for LAP in Science Content Area*  Collaboration with content area and ENL teachers to  develop a community of learning that is aligned with the Common Core.*  Be familiar with the academic performance of each  ELL by analyzing data.*  Allow opportunities for students to participate in conversation that develops their academic language  in scientific words.*  Create a print rich environment, using ENL dictionaries in a Science classroom.*  Provide high-interest,  low level independent reading books for ELLs.* Ensure that all language modalities are incorporated during lessons using a  varietly of methods including group collaboration and daily journal writing.*  Analyze data of ELLs to become informed about  the academic performance of each ELL.* Provide content vocabulary support. *  Bilingual dictionaries are used. Plan for ELLs  Requiring Intervention Support:ELLs who require additional support in the four modalities (speaking, listening, reading,  writing) include beginning or intermediate language learners, students with interrupted formal education (SIFE), grade  holdovers, newcomers and Special Education students.  Because of the small population of ELLs at MS 447 in the 2015-2016  school year, all, but one of our ELLs are at the Expanding or Commanding level and receiving support from the ELL provider.  The Transitioning ELL uses Native Language text, bilingual dictonaries, and can use Native Language when needed.  All are  considered newcomers and do not need additional services.  However, if intervention is required, MS 447 has a multitude of  providers willing to provide additional support.  In previous years, students that receive additional support are now former  ELLs.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Improvements for the upcoming school year are more focus for bilingual families to come to MS 447. For PTA meetings and  other parent meetings interpreters will be hired.  During the school's open house, there are interpreters in Arabic, Bengali,  Chinese, and Spanish. There are also special tours that can be taken for parents of other cultures.  The Danish and Spanish  families volunteer their time for new parents.  There are also office hours for ELLs that they can attend for extra help.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   None of our current programs will be discontinued.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are given equal access to all school programs by offering a variety of school programs open to all students.  Math and ELA  help specifically designed for ELLs is also offered.  ELLs work with the ENL provider during office hours for extra English  support.  During the school day, there is a variety of standard curricular classes including ELA, Math, Science, Social Studies and  Physical Education.  In addition, Art, Technology, Drama, Music, Dance, and Spanish are offered as electives.  MS 447 also  offers Exploration, which is an intercurricular program.  Exploration uses a hand-on approach to education providing topics  such as Forensics, Habitats-past and present, and waterways as a means of integrating all subject areas and students  interests.  After school, extracurricular activities include chess, photography, yearbook, basketball, robotics, wrestling,  bookclub, step cheerleading, and arts and crafts.  ELLs are active within the yearbook committee, bookclubs, sports clubs, and  after-school programs.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  MS 447 has a school website for students to access.  This website allows students to use PupilPath, which is a program where  students can contact teachers, access homework assignments, class notes, lessons, and other various handouts pertaining to  school.  The students are all trained in using PupilPath at the beginning of each school year. Science, ELA books, and Social  Studies documents are translated for ELLs, if needed.  Brainpop is also used. ELLs have access to BrianPop, BrianPop ESL, Khan  Academy, First in Math, Duolingo, and other such technology. Non-technology based instructional material are leveled books  and bilingual textbooks. The ENL teacher and the ELA/Content teachers work together to create modifications and graphic  organizers.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   We have a Spanish speaking SETTS provider who supports the ENL teacher and students with Native language support and  parental contact.  The ENL teacher also uses native language in ENL whenever possible.  This can be through translation.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Required services support and resources correspond to ELL’s ages and grade levels by ensuring that their goals are consistent  with their needs.  Every year required services evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of their support to ensure that the  resources are appropriate for ELLs and ELL-SWDs.  Throughout the year, related services is also a source for effective resources  for students. In classes, there are graphic organizers created for ELL-SWDs, as needed.  There are multitude of ways teachers  use to teach learners including ELL-SWDs like visuals,  groupwork, differentiated instruction, tangible hands-on objects, etc.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?         16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   At the beginning of the year, we have a soft open. During the soft open there are a multitude of icebreaker and teambuilding  activities for the students to interact with each other and learn about the school and their new teachers. Newly enrolled ELLs  meet the ELL provider, support staff, and parent coordinator prior to the start of the new year.  They can tour the school  building and the ELL provider provides the new ELLs a brief orientation where they can address any questions or  concerns.  Every school year, MS 447 offers an overnight field trip to Camp Bernie, which allows students to bond with each  other through team building exercises.  MS 447 also offers Exploration, which provides students to engage in hands on topics  in science. The students are split into groups and they use skills acquired from classes for investigating scientific theories and  applying them into real world skills. Exploration also allows students to go on field trips and learn about the environment  around them     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    All students are offered Spanish as a language elective.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47            18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   n/a     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The ENL Teacher has been to the Sole ENL Provider study groups on how to support and teach ELLs in the classroom as they  engage in the Common Core Learning Standards.  In the past, the PDs involved all ELL teachers in the Network, who were the  only ELL providers at their school.  They focused on creating lessons aligned to the CCLS, as well as, observation each other to  learn better teaching practices.               2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Teachers of 8th grade advisory are trained on the high school process in NYC, thereby helping students and parent of ELLs with  the process.  Our 8th grade guidance counselor sets up one-on-one meetings with the parents in their preferred language. The  parent coordinator goes to Professional Development that trains her to work with parents of ELLs.  She learns about preferred  language, translation assistance, and working with parents of ELLs and the importance of welcoming them into our  community, as well as, focusing on their questions and concerns regarding the high school process and entering middle  school.  The sixth grade staff works closely with the ELL provider to ensure that the ELLs are transitioning well and they learn  signs of ELLs needing extra support. The guidance counselor goes to Professional Development where she learns about ELL  development and obstacles that ELLs may encounter. The 6th grade guidance counselor also familiarizes herself with the  potential ELLs that are interested in our school.  The staff has access to all the information about the Translation and  Interpretation Unit and the ELL provider assists the staff with any other questions. MS 447 will provide professional  development to all teachers and administrators that will address the needs of ELLs. This will be 15% of all required professional  development hours for teachers. This will be completed during Monday PD hours Mondays, once a month. The PDs will focus  on language acquisition, co-teaching, and integrating language and content instruction in all areas.  The ELL provider will focus  50% of her professional development hours targeted to supporting ELLs in alignment with core content area instruction by  joining an ELL study group provided by DELLs. The teachers will look at formative assessment practices (aka an inquiry cycle),  which includes analyzing student work into success criteria for students so that teachers can access themselves more  accurately.  The ELL provider participates in this work to become more familiar with the Common Core Learning Standards and  how they're taught to provide language support.           Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48            Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?     Records are kept for annual individual meetings with ELL parents and outreach on a spreadsheet.  The spreadsheet has all  necessary data, such as contact info, preferred language, selection of program, etc. The spreadsheet is in the ENL binder, as  well as updated on googledocs.  On Google docs, the parent coordinator and administrators have access to the spreadsheet.  The ENL provider during parent orientation, asks parents their preferred method of communication and language, which is  recorded on the spreadsheet.  Once that is recorded any effort to reach parents will be through that method.  If translation is  needed than the Translation and Interpretation Unit is contacted.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  The ELL parents are encouraged to join the PTA. Our Parent Coodinator speaks Spanish and works to involve the ELL parents as  much as possible. In previous years, ELL parents were active in the PTA. They help to organize the Annual School Auction and  many other parent teacher events.       Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Arin Rusch, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Math and Science                                                                               School DBN: 15K447  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Once the school receives all the information from HLIS, ATS reports, Student Emergency Contact cards, and any  other parent survey, the LAC uses this data to determine the languages that parents need for communication. The  information is place onto a list of students who need translated forms. That list is given to the school aides  responsible for sending out forms. We have an Excel document in Google Drive with the languages parents speak,  organized by class and grade. We update that regularly. We use the ATS report, the Blue cards and parent surveys  to collect the data.         2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      Language    Written Preferred    Percent Written    Oral Preferred    Percent Oral    Spanish   Chinese   Slovak   Bengali   Danish   Arabic   Japanese   German   Polish   Dutch   Russian           38   7   2   4   1   2   3   1   1   2   1   4.97   38   4.97   .92   .26   .52   .13   .26   .39   .13   .13   .26   .13   7   2   4   1   2   3   1   1   2   1   .92   .26   .52   .13   .26   .39   .13   .13   .26   .13   3.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      In the event of an emergency, the Parent Coordinator sends out messages through Remind in varying languages. The  principal sends out e-mails and those are translated via Google Translate.             Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure    Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      At the beginning of each school year during our staff meeting, the principal addresses a multitude of housekeeping  rules. One topic that gets addressed is communication with parents. All staff is given information of how to contact  parents and information about the translation and interpretation services.           Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      The school posts the required posters right in front of the main office for the parents as required by the Department  of Education. We note for school staff that all notification documents can be found at the Translation and  Interpretation Unit's intranet site.           Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       We send out a yearly survey which asks the parents how the school is doing on a multitude of levels including  translating and communication. It also asks if there is anything we can improve upon. The LAC plans to schedule a  focus group of parents, inclusive of all cultures and languages represented in our school to gather feedback.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55
