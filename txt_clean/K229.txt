This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The motto of P.S. 229K is "Home, School, Community.” These three supports are the necessary elements to educate all  children academically, socially and emotionally.    We are creating a community of caring, technologically sophisticated, self-directed, lifelong learners, through content- rich curriculum, standards-driven instruction and active parent involvement.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      We are committed to having all our children meet standards of excellence and become productive citizens of the 21st  century (Mission Statement and Vision).            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   The majority of the students currently served live in the neighborhood zone of Dyker Heights, closest to Bath Beach.    Additional families from District 20 select P.S./I.S. 229K for Gifted and Talented programs, one for elementary grades  (K-5) and the other for middle school (grades 6-8), The District 20 Superintendent’s Program: The Honors Academy  @229K.      Home – School – Community   The family is the primary teacher who hands on the value of school and learning to the young.    During 2017-18, the Common Core-aligned Go Math! Academy, an online resource which corresponds to math  instruction lesson by lesson for K-8, provides tutorials/explanations of procedures in mathematical practices for  parent and child, as well as math games for the child to enjoy at home.    The Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) actively seeks to involve families in their children’s school life. In order to keep  families and students aware of mastery as well as areas in need of improvement, our PTA has generously funded the  online application, Pupil Path, to improve the home-school connection and correspondence.   Families also have access to our school website, www.PS229.org, which provides links to resources to support their  children academically.   For families of fifth and eighth graders (and any others who wish to attend), transitioning to middle/high school  workshops are presented by our parent coordinator and guidance counselor.   Family events are hosted throughout the year for children and their families (e.g., Fall Carnival, Parent & Child nights,  concerts, annual art show, classroom celebrations). We plan to increase such offerings in the 2017-18 school year,  focusing around literacy and mathematics.     Parent workshops allow parents and guardians to learn about strategies to use at home in order to help the child  grow intellectually, socially, and emotionally.   Teachers use additional supports of choice (e.g., TenMarks [math], Class DoJo, Remind.com) to keep in contact with  the families of their students.      Home – School – Community   Throughout the grades, our personnel are provided with resources for a standards-based curriculum strong in  foundational reading, writing, and mathematical skills instruction, as well as hands-on and higher-order thinking   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      activities for enrichment and/or remediation. In addition to a beautiful, new school library, classrooms are stocked  with leveled books for use by the children.   The Arts have been an integral part of our curriculum since the 1980s, starting with the development of a School Band  and sequential General Music programs. In the 1990s, the music program expanded to include an Orchestra Program  (string ensembles), along with the addition of a sequential Visual Arts program and an after-school Musical Theatre  program. In recent years, as the school expanded from being an elementary school to a Pre-Kindergarten to Grade 8  community, our Arts Programs and staff have grown to offer courses to all students as well.   During the 2016-17 school year, a number of partnerships were continued. Junior Achievement (JA) is the world's  largest organization dedicated to educating students in grades K-12 about entrepreneurship, work readiness, and  financial literacy through experiential, hands-on, multidisciplinary programs — connecting information across social  studies disciplines, such as economics, geography, history, government, and civics, while incorporating mathematical  concepts and reasoning and language arts skills correlated to the Common Core standards. Materials were given to  the school for a weekly grade 6 program and a trip to the Brooklyn Finance Park. Edward R. Murrow High School  students came and addressed our youngest learners. A group of eighth graders were invited to visit the business  school campus at New York University. Professionals from the business world came and spent a day with our middle  school students.   Students in grade four are given the opportunity to join the orchestra in the highly participatory Link Up program at  Carnegie Hall, in which they learn to sing and play recorder in the classroom and perform with a professional  orchestra with the rest of the audience at a culminating concert in Carnegie Hall’s Stern Auditorium. Professional  Development is provided and materials (from Carnegie Hall’s Weill Music Institute) are used with our students prior to  the event.   In the upper elementary grades (4-6), general education official class teachers have developed a departmental  program for English, mathematics, science, and social studies, in consultation with administration.    All students in the middle school grades (6-8) have the opportunity to select and participate in enrichment clubs  during the school day. In eighth grade, these young people have the opportunity to take the Spanish Language  Proficiency Examination in order to obtain high school credit. Honors Academy students also have high school level  classes culminating in the Core Algebra 1 and Living Environment Regents Examinations at the end of grade 8, with a  100% passing rate since we began offering those state examinations.   We continue to build our school website, www.PS229.org, using an updated platform created by the eChalk company  webmasters.      Home – School – Community   Community Connections, sponsored by the PTA, staff members, or student groups, unite our students with the needs  of the world around them. Students participate in events, which include a food drive, a collection of pajamas with  Scholastic Books, a Halloween Art Store Window Painting Contest (by a local civic organization), and fundraisers for  people in special need around the world.   The Neighborhood Improvement Association (NIA) COMPASS program has long partnered with the school to offer an  after-school enrichment program for students in Kindergarten through grade 5 (recently adding the program for  middle schoolers explained above). This year, the NIA offered Family Tech Nights for parents and their children.   The Neighborhood Improvement Association (NIA) SONYC (free after-school program for middle schoolers) is now in  its third year at 229K. This program continues to enhance student life via trips to New York City cultural institutions  and athletic complexes; Specialized High School Admissions Test (SHSAT) preparation sessions; our CHAMPS   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      basketball team (The 229 Tigers) plays other schools with an NIA program at home and away, in addition to the  regularly scheduled Saturday games; and collaboration with the New York Pops on a Broadway Jr. performance at  the school.    Student Safety Squad members assist our early childhood children during morning breakfast and line-up routines.   We cooperate with institutions of higher learning to assist alumni and staff on their pathway toward fulfilling state  certification requirements for staffing schools (e.g., observation hours, student teaching).   In addition to the names of citizenship awardees and the academic honor roll posted in the hallway en route to the  general office, we are proud to be an affiliate-school hosting the P.S./I.S. 229 Chapter of the National Junior Honor  Society since 2010, which promotes four pillars of excellence: Character, Scholarship, Leadership, and Service. Young  women and men who maintain membership for three years in the Society are recognized at Graduation.   Having just completed our Sixth Commencement, our eighth graders join the ranks of past graduates who have been  accepted into Brooklyn Latin, Brooklyn Technical, LaGuardia, Staten Island Technical, as well as Stuyvesant High  Schools. Other alumni have been accepted into high school honors and special programs throughout the city.      May P.S./I.S. 229K continue to be a lively center for sound learning, new discovery, and the pursuit of wisdom.  Whether our students work individually or as a team, academically or in service for the sake of others, may these  activities strengthen their skills, values, and perspectives that will best prepare them for family leadership, high  school, college, and career success, as well as active citizenship.         3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   From the NYC DOE P.S. 229 Statistics webpage "Register," we find the following student population characteristics  about 229K: 56% Asian, 29% White, 12% Hispanic, 2% Black, 1% Other.   15% Students with Disabilities (having IEPs), 12% English Language Learners;   Our students with disabilities have social-emotional needs that require strategies and approaches that address their  emotional challenges and support them socially. They are supported academically in the least restrictive environment.  We have an Integrated Co-Teaching class on every grade-level, from Pre-K through grade 8. Students in our five  special education classrooms (12:1), are integrated into our general education classes for content learning.   Our English Language Learner population has shifted some in recent years from mostly second generation immigrants  to more new arrivals with little English. Therefore, there is a much greater need for vocabulary acquisition and  foundational skills. We are continuing to work with District 20 and Brooklyn South FSC staff to implement Advanced  Literacy (N. Lesaux). Moving away from a remediation approach to an enrichment approach, our ESL teachers now co- teach in a push-in model.    Total enrollment in our school has reached a record 1,253 students.   41.5% Free Lunch Eligible; 11.3% Reduced Lunch Eligible.       4.

In the 2017-18 school  year, “Effective School Leadership” remained strong at 82%, and “Trust” continued to be strong at 87%. “Strong  Family-Community Ties” was actually the strongest at 91%. A key area of focus will be to establish a classroom and  school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers ("Supportive  Environment," 69%). Another key area of focus will be to ensure that all students, particularly the sub-groups of  Students with Disabilities, English Language Learners, and high-achieving students are challenged and supported by  ”Rigorous Instruction” (79%).               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 20K229   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   0K,01,02,03,04,05,0 6,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   1249   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     During the 2017-18 school year, we continued to make a number of changes to align our curriculum resources to the  New York State Common Core Learning Standards through teacher team-created unit pacing, performance tasks, and  rubrics to assess student achievement and areas for improvement. Teachers are seeing more readiness on the part of  the children to reflect on their own work, particularly in the area of writing in all content areas.    The most recent Quality Review (Spring 2015) revealed "curricula and academic tasks consistently emphasize rigorous  tasks and higher-order thinking skills across grades and subject areas, and are planned and refined using student work  and data. A diversity of learners, including English language learners (ELLs) and students with disabilities (SWDs), have  access to the curricula and tasks and are cognitively engaged."     Each year, the Common Core-aligned state examinations are being designed calling students to increasing attention to  detail and thoroughness in their responses. The Spring 2018 assessments resulted in 67% of all students (7% of ELLs;  21% of SWDs) demonstrating proficiency in English Language Arts (ELA) and 74% of all students (37% of ELLs; 32% of  SWDs) demonstrating proficiency in Mathematics. Our school has met the annual yearly progress (AYP) goals  determined by New York State. (Source: data.nysed.gov/assessment)    As we move forward in the 2018-19 school year, we will revise and amend last year’s work as deemed necessary in  the light of a new emphasis on the connections between 1e-Designing Coherent Instruction and Domain 3 of the  Framework for Teaching (3b-Questioning & Discussion, 3c-Engaging Students in Learning, and 3d- Assessment in  Instruction).     Classroom portfolios gather student writing related to all academic areas in order to focus attention of the children,  their families, and staff on progress throughout the year. Following fruitful classroom discussion and student  engagement ("speaking" and "language acquisition"), we will continue focusing upon the writing portion of lessons,  particularly as related to ELA and Math activities for all students, including ELLs, SWDs, and high achievers.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   By June 2019, teachers will design and implement Common Core Learning Standards aligned, project-based learning  opportunities with scaffolds and supports for all students; including students with disabilities, English language learners,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15      and advanced students through teacher observation evidence and student learning evidence related to Advance  components 1e, 3b, 3c, and 3d.

Professional development opportunities will be offered with  strategies for academic intervention, students with  disabilities, and English languages learners in all classrooms.  Sessions topics will include scaffolding instruction,  differentiated instruction, modalities of learning/universal  design for learning. Also, teacher Inquiry Teams will look at  student work, assessing student progress impacted by  specific strategies, and sharing best practices with the entire  staff. Strategies will be put in place to address the needs of  all students, including ELLs and SWDs.   Our newly formed ESL Inquiry Team (along with Grade-Level  Inquiry Teams) will be focused on our ELL students and  strategies to successfully support them in their classrooms.  With support from the Brooklyn South FSC, our shift in  Advanced Literacy will result in a set of schoolwide  instructional practices and routines for implementation,  which will become our site-specific Hallmarks of Advanced  Literacies.   In order to continue to promote the participation of parents  and communities of limited English proficient children, we  will use both site-based and outside resources for  translation/ interpretation of communications and support  materials in Chinese, Spanish, Russian and Arabic. We have  identified the preferred languages of families for each class  to ensure these communications and supports are provided.

What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  The NYC DOE 2017-18 School Quality Guide includes data from the NYC Survey of middle school students, all families,  and staff indicates that this element still needs to be reviewed. Our school's strength lies in "social-emotional"  component, while "personal support" and "classroom behavior" components need further study. Personal attention  and support as reported by students is at 58%, which is significantly below the city average of 69%, and just below the  “approaching target” point.  More focus on discovering new strategies to build student ownership of lessons, allowing for more student  interaction and discussion, with the teacher acting as facilitator in a supportive environment can support the  importance of a child's self-awareness and the process of self-actualization. The best evidence for student  engagement is what students are saying and doing as a consequence of what the teacher does, has done, or has  planned. While students may be involved in "hands-on" activities, it is more essential that they be "minds-on." It is  also essential that our teachers, “encourage students and actually teach them the necessary skills of monitoring their  own learning against clear standards,” (Framework for Teaching).       Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  By June 2019, administrators will observe a .10 increase in effective/highly effective ratings in the Framework for  Teaching components of 2a-Creating an Environment of Respect and Rapport (3.80 or higher), and   3c-Engaging Students in Learning (3.45 or higher).

Teacher Teams have been established previously, at each grade level. A grade leader (a role given first to those who  volunteer) serves as the liaison between the team and administration, though all teams are encouraged to rotate  members into the various roles.     During the 2015-16 school year, our teams began participating in the District 20 Collaborative Inquiry Process, which  continues to be a district-wide focus. Protocols proving to be useful will continue to be used. New protocols tested  successfully by one or more teams will be shared with the staff as a whole.  During the 2017-18 school year, teams went deeper into the inquiry cycles in order to have a more profound  understanding of individual student needs, paying particular attention to English language learners, students with  disabilities, and those in need of academic intervention.     This year (2018-19),a new team will focus upon ELLs in one grade, based on scores from the 2017 New York State  Examinations, that will be Grade 4. We have seen no increase in the number of ELL students reaching proficiency on  the NYS ELA Test, from grade 3 to grade 4 (three). Yet, we did see an increase in the number of ELL students  performing at Level 1 on the NYS ELA Test, from Grade 4 to Grade 5 (up from four students, to six).

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Column B   Verify with an (X)   Section Reference(s)   Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local                                                  1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 229 Dyker, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the  Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      P.S. 229  will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students     providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level,   e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology;     providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and      decision making in support of the education of their children;  fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress;     providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;     sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and  in languages that parents can understand;     providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and  other members of the school community      Parental Involvement and School Quality   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:      actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s  Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of  the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;     engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated   directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;     ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and      strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the  Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing  technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;     maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and  families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the  assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school  environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of  events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office;  conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational  accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and  support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;        provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State   accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality  Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;     host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise   parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right  to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118  and other applicable sections under the ESSA;  schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the  morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the  Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions;  translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;   conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help.              The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement     holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;    hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school   year;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40           encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-  Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee;  supporting or hosting Family Day events;       establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;    encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;    providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their   children’s progress;     developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about   school activities and student progress;     providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a   format, and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.   School-Parent Compact (SPC)       School-Parent Compact (SPC)   P.S. 229 Dyker, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is  implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between  the school and the families.

Serving the testing grades, emphasis is  placed on English language arts and "reading mathematics" in preparation for the NYS Common  Core assessments.  Preassessments, including MOSL and Scantron Performance Series Data is  used to support student placement in the program.  Imagine learning reports will be executed in  the native/home language for each student. For students in grades 3-8, individual language  support (i.e. - Chinese) will be provided for newcomers.  Students will be divided into three groups, based on grade levels and/or proficiency needs (e.g.,  grades K-2, grades 3-5; grades 6-8). One  teacher will service students in grades K-2, one teacher  will service students in grades 3-5, one teacher will service students in grades 6-8.  The program  will run on Wednesdays from September through April for a maximum of 28 sessions (2:31- 4:31PM) and will be conducted in English by three NYS certified teachers of English as a second  language.   Thematic units using leveled books (e.g., Rigby Program) for guided reading as well as posters,  charts, and worktexts to integrate the content areas of science, social studies, and mathematics,  helping to reinforce content and skills needed by the children for successful achievement of the  Common Core Learning Standards.  The sessions are structured with interactive, multi-sensory  elements where plenty of visual aids and auditory components are provided.  Students will also  be supported in their ESL instruction through the use of Imagine Learning software.  This  program allows children to work independently on language skills at their level and at their own  pace.  As a child's skills level increases, the program moves the child to the next higher level.  A  "Newcomer Kit" will help develop language skills through the use of manipulative charts,  language practice games, and vocabulary building activities.  Together, these components  provide the resources needed for differentiated instruction according to students' needs.  These  materials are used solely for the Title III program.  Attendance will be recorded at each session.  Teachers will maintain portfolios of student work  and provide outreach to parents in their native/preferred languages.     ELLs in Kindergarten through grade 2 will also be supported in the language acquisition through  use of Imagine Learning software program.  Through the use of multimedia, students receive  individualized instruction while actionable data is delivered to instructors who may then plan  session lessons accordingly.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.     rationale  teachers to receive training          schedule and duration      name of provider   topics to be covered   Begin description here:                     The focus of professional development (PD) is to assist teachers in enhancing their strategies and  methods in helping students achieve English language proficiency.

All  parent letters, including progress reports, will be printed in the student’s first language when  available, ensuring student comprehension. As their children work through the program, parents  receive progress reports. These home reports provide parents with actionable steps to support  their child outside of the classroom. Along with the home reports, worksheets are also sent home  so that learning may continue there.  These materials are part of the Imagine Learning English  software provided by Imagine Learning.  The reports and worksheets are sent home with the  student.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?   Our school continues to assess the students'  progress both formally and informally through tests data and observation to  know where their entry points are. For ELA, grades K-5 use the Open Court and grades 6-8 use Pearson Core Literature  curriculum. For Math, grades K-8 use Go Math. Each program has benchmarks and assessments.  Every teacher uses the  programs to establish their students' literacy benchmarks and determine progress throughout the year. All ENL teachers have  been trained on Fountas and Pinnell and have kits in their classrooms to immediately measure growth and progress in terms of  literacy and reading level. In addition, classroom teachers used individualized/modified assessments to fit the individualized  needs of the ELLs, especially newcomer ELLs who have skills that are well below their grade levels. Teachers will differentiate  the materials using different graphic organizers and prompts in order to guide instructional planning for the ELLs. All  assessment data is thoroughly analyzed and informs classroom contents and decisions.     In addition, the EDAT tool is helpful in assigning risk levels for students, analyzing data trends over time and describing the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      individual strengths and weaknesses of the students. The tool clearly indicates the needs of each student individually and  shows what academic needs need to be addressed. Current and past data indicators influence and inform instruction and  scaffolds, so the instruction will be targeted and the scaffolds will be tailored exactly to the needs of the students.              2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The ENL teachers work in conjunction with the classroom and content area teachers to ensure the individualized assessments  and measures are accurate, useful and fit the direct needs of the children. Some of these assessments in place are classroom  exams for the ELLs, conferencing with the teacher, writing assignments, reports, reading comprehension exams, research  papers, questioning, group assignments and peer editing. All taken together, this data gives an up to date and accurate view of  their skills and their needs.    The school uses this current data to inform instruction, generate expectations, differentiate and group effectively.  Recent ELA, NYSESLAT and NYSITELL data are also analyzed thoroughly, and past ELA and NYSESLAT data are examined for  trends. The EDAT data is useful in combining the all the data and assigning risk levels for the students. It also indicates the  students' weaknesses so targeted instruction and scaffolds can specifically focus on their areas of need. This data is very useful  and important initially, but are lagging indicators of current performance levels. P.S./I.S. 229 uses all data available to create  appropriate instruction based on the needs of the ELLs.     Upon analysis of the data, as a school the ELLs are making the expected gains and improvements in their levels of progress.  Saying this, ELLs face additional challenges and struggles and the data has shown the importance of close coordination and  communication between the classroom teachers and the ENL teachers to ensure classroom activities and instructional  activities provide the essential scaffolds and levels of differentiation that fit the individual needs of the ELLs.    In addition, current classroom data has shown that developing strong academic language skills needs to be stressed further.  School wide EDAT data clearly shows that the ELLs have more pronounced weaknesses on their writing and speaking sections  of the NYSESLAT exam and these weaknesses carry over to the writing portion of the ELA test. Also, ELLs have expected  weaknesses in developing grade level reading skills which need to be addressed via targeted instruction and targeted  scaffolding to develop the foundational skills in conjunction with the current grade level skills sets.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?   Each class has beginning of the year, mid-term and final assessment benchmarks to measure students' progress and growth.  At the beginning of the year, all teachers have a classroom-based baseline assessment to determine students' current  academic skills and needs. Throughout the year, teachers continually assess progress  through classroom tests, projects,  individual and group work, teacher-student conferences, and participation to determine progress and needs.    In addition to summative assessments and ongoing classroom assessments, each teacher is provided a list of the dates of entry  and NYSESLAT results for all the ELLs and former ELLs in the class. EDAT data is analyzed to ensure teachers have a strong  knowledge base of their students' academic needs and are familiar with the trends in their academic progress over time. This  helps with gauging accurate expectations and monitoring expected progress. Any student who is not making expected  progress receives additional differentiated instruction, scaffolds and support based on current needs.    Consistent discussions are held between the classroom teachers and the ENL teachers to identify areas of need and formulate  solutions to benefit the identified needs of the students. As a whole, academic language has been identified as a concern for  current and even some former ELLs. Student needs are discussed individually and if applicable, as a group if there is an  identified weakness across the spectrum of ELLs/FELLs represented in the classroom.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53             4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Students who are having academic difficulties are closely monitored. All ELL teachers are members of the PPT committee. ELLs  are referred to the PPT committee to discuss additional academic intervention based on the needs and progress of the child.  Additional methods of classroom differentiation are suggested during PPT meetings. When a child is labeled at-risk, ELLs are  able to attend at-risk SETSS to receive additional support. ELL teachers are in close communication with classroom teachers  and parents to ensure appropriate interventions take place.       5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Utilizing the RTI framework, ELLs receive Tier 2 remediation within the Title III program offered once a week for two hours  after school.  Students are programmed after analyzing NYSESLAT data in addition to ongoing summative assessments  describing classroom performance. Targeted intervention services are updated and adjusted according to student  achievement levels – as per standardized and teacher-created assessments.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Based on the ELL Data Analysis Tool,  the students across the grades are scoring higher on the reading and listening modalities  on the NYSESLAT. The writing and the speaking modalities are determined to be in greater need via the EDAT tool across all  grades.  We examined the data patterns from the past and this seems to be a similar trend each year. Since the writing  modality is the weakest part for the ELLs performance, it takes quite some time for the students to develop these academic  skills. Students who arrive literate in their native language are improving at a faster rate and they make use of tablets with  translation programs and word to word bilingual dictionaries/glossaries.  We try to focus more on developing strong writing  skills within the ENL program by using different graphic organizers.  Scaffolds are used that address their writing difficulties. As  for the speaking portion, we encourage the students to participate more during ENL classes where there are smaller groups  and they would not be as intimidated in front of the whole class. We also encourage students  to listen more so that they can  imitate and produce the language.      In addition, students labeled high risk via EDAT, receive targeted instruction based on their assessed needs. This information is  shared with content level and classroom teachers so all involved are on the same page regarding the academic needs of the  child.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?  Close coordination between classroom/content area teachers and the ENL teachers is a key. We consistently discuss,  articulate, plan, and address the current needs of the ELL population. ELL teachers provide the classroom teachers with up to  date stats and information governing the ELLs. Classroom teachers not only know past formative exam scores but also patterns  within year to year formative exam scores over time. We individualize instruction based on their current needs and we modify  and adapt strategies that fit the needs of our current population. We strive for high academic achievement and progress, while  always attempting to ensure that the ELLs feel comfortable and secure to make the gains they need. Constant feedback and  coordination between all teachers serving ELLs helps the ENL teachers and administration evaluate the levels of success.    Our school is meeting AYP regarding the ELL population. We strive to have our students do well on state examinations, but we  also measure our success internally, within our school. We consistently monitor the progress and development of our students  inside their classrooms and ensure their academic and social-emotional needs are addressed by classroom/content area  teachers and the ENL teachers.            Part IV: ELL Programming  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54        Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   All current ELLs and commanding students who passed the NYSESLAT in the last two years within the same grade are  placed in a class and served via a Freestanding ENL program. A certified ENL teacher will provide 180 minutes of  integrated ENL instruction per week to entering through expanding ELLs and 90 minutes of integrated ENL for  commanding students during ELA instruction. ENL teachers meet with the common branch or content area teachers  and they plan, discuss, and create lessons together. They work collaboratively in the classroom to assist the language  needs of the students. The ENL teachers not only assists the students, but model appropriate ENL methodologies for  the classroom teacher to use when the ENL teacher is not in the room.     In addition, the ENL teachers will provide 180 minutes of stand-alone ENL instructions to entering and emerging  students per week. The ENL teachers asses the individual language needs of each child using a variety of measures.  Some examples are NYSESLAT levels, NYSITELL levels, reading and writing exams, group work, classroom performance,  additional state exams, current vocabulary tests, writing samples and conferences. The ENL teachers use the results to  create lessons tailored to the individual language needs of the their students.     All students are grouped in heterogeneous classes and the entire class travels together. In an integrated setting  ELLs are grouped based on mixed proficiency levels and in a stand alone setting, the grouping changes since the  proficiency levels of the students within the class are similar. Grouping decisions change to reflect the current needs  of the students. For example, an emerging level student may be grouped next to another student who speaks his or  her language initially, and after the student's language ability strengthens the support will be removed. The student  will no longer sit with the same student as before so he or she can continue to develop language independence and  confidence.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   As per CR Part 154, entering and emerging students will receive 180 minutes of standalone ENL plus 180 minutes of integrated  ENL. Transitioning students will receive 90 minutes of standalone ENL plus 90 minutes of integrated ENL or 180 minutes of  integrated ENL depending on the individual needs of the student. Expanding students will receive 180 minutes of integrated  ENL. Commanding students will receive 90 of integrated ENL for two years.    ATS reports are used to ensure all eligible ELLs are served and all NYSESLAT/NYSITELL results are used to ensure all  ELLs/FELLs receive the mandated number of minutes as per 154 and these are consistent with their test scores and language  designations.    All current ELLs and commanding students who passed the NYSESLAT in the last two years within the same grade are placed in  a class and served via a Freestanding ENL program. A certified ENL teacher will provide 180 minutes of integrated ENL  instruction per week to entering through expanding ELLs and 90 minutes of integrated ENL for commanding students  during ELA instruction. ENL teachers meet with the common branch or content area teachers and they plan, discuss, and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      create lessons together. They work collaboratively in the classroom to assist the language needs of the students. The ENL  teachers not only assists the students, but model appropriate ENL methodologies for the classroom teacher to use when the  ENL teacher is not in the room.     In addition, the ENL teachers will provide 180 minutes of stand-alone ENL instruction to entering and emerging students per  week. They will work on foundational English instruction and connect it to the work that is being done in the content area  classrooms. For example, if a personal narrative is being written in the content area ELA class, the ENL teacher will use ENL  methodologies and scaffolding approaches to teach the same skills in the stand alone setting. The ENL teachers and  classroom teachers communicate frequently to ensure their is continuity, coordination and familiarity between classroom  environments and similar skills/topics are being addressed.       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   In both integrated and stand alone settings, ENL instruction is conducted in English. Content is made comprehensible to  students by the use of visual aids, tablets, word to word dictionaries and glossaries, scaffolding strategies (e.g. explicit  vocabulary instruction, background knowledge, modification of activities and assessments, graphic organizers, answer frames,  sentence starters, adapted texts) and modeling. The ENL teacher will work closely and collaborate with the homeroom teacher  on lesson planning and scaffolding instructional strategies. Formal and informal assessments are conducted consistently by the  ENL teacher and content area teacher who work together as a team. Instructional methods are modified based on student  progress. Students are grouped effectively and classroom materials, methods and instructional formats are chosen and  implemented with the targeted needs of the ELLs in mind. The ELLs learn the same curriculum as non-ELLs, academic  vocabulary is stressed and students are exposed to accessible work that is challenging.    Kindergarten to fifth grades use Open Court ELA program. Sixth to eighth grades use the Pearson Common Core Literature  program. All programs have an ESL component embedded within them. In addition, supplemental materials are used to help  differentiate lessons with entering to transitioning students.     In both integrated and stand alone settings native language support is provided when applicable. Students are always  encouraged to learn English in conjunction with their native language and never in place of their native language. The diverse  cultures of our diverse student body are celebrated and respected. Students are provided word to word bilingual dictionaries,  tablets for research and translation purposes, NYCDOE provided content area bilingual glossaries, and students have access to  some independent reading books in their native language. Students who are unable to write in English or would like the  opportunity to complete scheduled assignments in their native language are given this opportunity. Entering and emerging  students often sit next to students who are fluent in their native language to ensure they have additional support in the  classroom.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   All newly admitted Spanish speaking students taking the NYSITELL are given the Spanish LAB exam. This provides the most  definitive evaluation for Spanish speaking students.     There are a number of reasons why it is educational sound to determine how fluent an ELL is in their native language. Research  has shown that a student who is literate in their first language has an easier time learning a second language. Also, part of the  ENL program is promoting native language support. One needs to have an understanding of a student's language ability in the  native language to provide appropriate materials and levels of support. If the student is in grades 3-8, depending on their  native language reading ability, they will be eligible for testing accommodations like a word-to-word bilingual  dictionary/glossary or possibly a translated version of the exam in their native language. An additional reason involves student  grouping. There are times when students are grouped together, especially if they are new admits, based on the ability to speak  the same native language and there are times when students are separated, especially if they are not progressing, because  they aren't taking enough risks with English if they are surrounded by students who speak their language.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56        Additional student interviews and discussions with parents allow teachers to determine whether a student is literate in his/her  native language. If the student is literate in his/her native language, then the student is given a chance to demonstrate  understanding of classroom activities and content area instructions through evaluation and writing pieces in their native  languages with the help of translation apps.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a.  SIFE students who are struggling are brought up at PPT meetings. Differentiation measures and targeted instruction are  discussed and if needed, SIFE students are provided with at-risk SETSS. SIFE students are also invited to the Title III after-school  program.     b. Newcomers receive instruction on phonics, vocabulary building and grammar skills. They are able to utilize the Imagine  Learning English interactive computer program in various classrooms during advanced reading and writing lessons. They are  then able to continue using Imagine Learning English at home. The ENL teacher is able to track their progress on the computer  program. Steps are taken to ensure the child feels comfortable and the classroom atmosphere is conducive for the acquisition  of English skills. Discussions are held with the general ed teacher to ensure the child's needs are met when the ENL teacher  isn't present. For upper grade newcomer students who are literate in their native language, they are provided with tablets in  the classroom to use to help translate the materials into their own native language.     c. Developing ELLs are generally able to perform grade appropriate work with intensive scaffolding support during the  instruction such as explicit vocabulary instruction, visual aids, background knowledge builders, graphic organizers, answer  frames, adapted texts, language prompts and models.     d. Long term ELLs require motivation and need to be challenged academically in class. Analyzing academic data trends and  conversations with the child's prior teachers help isolate the reasons why the child hasn't reached English proficiency. Steps  are then taken to ensure the student receives academic support in the areas he/she needs it most. The instructional focus for  long term ELLs tend to be intensive reading and writing skills.    e. Former ELLs receive 90 minutes of ENL services in an integrated setting. They have lingering language needs and these  needs are identified based on the measures described earlier in the LAP. These students receive targeted instruction based on  the needs identified. They are  thoroughly involved in all classroom activities. Since they are former ELLs, and have  demonstrated English proficiency, they are given differentiated instruction that is challenging and engaging while also focusing  on improving areas of weakness.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?      Within the Open Court Program for grades K-5 and Pearson Common Core Literature for grades 6-8, there are specific RTI/ELL  strategies and methodologies that the teachers use for ELL-SWDs. Further differentiation occurs based on recorded data from  ongoing formative and summative assessments. This is used to help inform, differentiate, and scaffold instruction and assist  with creating flexible groups within the classroom.  A variety of measures and strategies are used to support academic content  and develop language acquisition. Some examples are: the use of visual aids, tablets, word to word dictionaries and glossaries,  scaffolding strategies (e.g. explicit vocabulary instruction, background knowledge, modification of activities and assessments,  graphic organizers, answer frames, sentence starters, adapted texts) and modeling.     Consistent communication and articulation occurs between the special ed teachers and the ENL teacher to ensure the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      academic needs are being addressed in the classroom from a language perspective and from a special ed perspective. The  teachers work together as a team to benefit the individual needs of each student and the classroom as a whole. Information  such as prior test scores, dates of entry, progress trends and EDAT summaries are shared with the special ed teacher. The ENL  teacher reads each IEP to have all the relevant information about their students. ENL and special ed scaffolding strategies are  chosen and consistently modified to reflect the individual needs of the students and create an environment for accelerated  English development.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Utilizing flexible programming guidelines, ELL students are programmed to maximize ELA instruction with integrated services  and stand alone instructional sessions during minor subject assignments and/or enrichment activities.  This methodology  provides ELLs with the optimum amount of time to receive instruction from their primary teachers as well as additional  support from ELL service providers that work in smaller groups to meet the individual needs of each student (as per their IEP).     In addition, ENL teachers take part in IEP meetings and participate in instructional decisions. Students who will benefit from  mainstreaming in particular subjects are mainstreamed.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  PS/IS 229 makes use of numerous forms of data available to make informed decisions about students and to highlight their  educational needs. These tools include ATS reports, The AMAO tool, teacher observations, Fontas and Pinnell, portfolio and  student work samples, teacher articulation, classroom exams, and student interviews. Data retrieved is closely scrutinized for  trends, comparisons, current levels, and ongoing progress.     Once teachers have an accurate understanding of student needs, a number of intervention programs are offered to struggling  ELLs from all subgroups. One available option will be the Title III ENL After School program. This program’s intent is to target  student’s particular academic needs and address academic weaknesses. All at risk ELLs will be invited and every effort will be  made to assure attendance. This program serves ELLs from all subgroups.     All intervention programs are conducted in English. Targeted/struggling ELLs will be invited to the expected  ELA and math  after school programs. In addition, struggling ELLs who have been referred to the PPT committee can also receive at risk SETSS.     Once a student is receiving targeted intervention services, he or she is monitored very closely. These are the primary targeted  intervention programs with names attached, but consistent targeted intervention is happening daily in the classrooms through  differentiated RTI instruction. Classroom teachers consistently make modifications and adapt lessons based on the different  needs of the students. Teachers are trained to use differentiation as much as possible and provide RTI directly to the ELLs in  their classes.     For example, an entering/emerging level ELL who took the ELA for the first time and received a level 1 would be in a targeted  group within their classroom tailored specifically to students with similar academic needs. He or she will also be invited to  attend the Title III ENL after-school program and be in a group made up of other ELLs who are taking the ELA but are still  learning basic academic vocabulary and are struggling with literacy skills.       Common planning occurs to differentiate and scaffold instruction. The ENL teacher also models lessons and provides training  so the content area classroom is a rich environment for the ELLs to learn and acquire language. Teachers assist students in  becoming familiar with the terminology used on the NYS examinations. In each of the academic areas (mathematics, science  and social studies), students are introduced to vocabulary through visuals and translations when available. We provide  translated versions of the standardized tests for our Chinese and Spanish speaking ELL students who are more literate in their  native languages so that they may demonstrate their content knowledge on the State Math, Science, and Social Studies tests   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      rather than have their results influenced by a lack of English proficiency.         9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Based on the NYSESLAT Modality Analysis, the trend showed that the area with the most need is the writing modality. To  further enhance the educational experiences of our ELLs, we will introduce the Imagine Learning English home version  program to all students in need so that they can use the program at home to improve both their reading and writing skills. This  program has grammar lessons and vocabulary exercises the students can practice at home.    In school, we will offer writing workshops to those in need in order to help improve their skills and move them to the next  level.  For example, we will focus more on developing strong writing foundational skills and emphasize academic vocabulary.  Partnerships will be strengthened with the classroom teachers so work is coordinated and skills are transferred throughout the  content areas. ELLs will utilize writing journals in conjunction with their independent reading so their writing will directly  correspond to their current reading. A variety of skills and topics will be written about in their journals so they won't be a  vehicle to summarize what they are reading. They will discuss characters, conflict, main ideas, setting etc.. in their journals.  They will be asked thought provoking questions and be expected to utilize academic vocabulary within their writing journals.  Ideally, students will then be both reading and writing at home each day. Journals will be assessed on a weekly basis in  addition to their reading logs.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  The school provides ELLs with equal access to various after-school programs, such as theater workshop, band, orchestra, visual  arts, writing workshop, NIA, CHAMPS, chorus, and Title III after-school programs. ELLs are encouraged to participate and  provisions are made so parent/guardian letters and materials are in the native language and translation is provided so the  students and parents/guardians will feel comfortable and be more likely to participate. The ENL teachers become involved by  encouraging and monitoring participation. Parents/guardians are contacted via telephone during parent engagement time and  the multi-lingual translation team is involved with making phone calls. Student participation helps develop confidence,  friendships and contributes to the development of academic and social English fluency.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Throughout the school, we use the Open Court and Pearson Common Core Literature literacy programs (which include  strategies for ELLs), and Go Math with its hands-on activities and math word walls.  The NYC Science and Social Studies core  curriculum text-based programs also offer teaching recommendations for ELLs.  Students use Imagine Learning English which is  an interactive computer program with native language support which focus on grade-level spelling, phonics, grammar,  listening and reading comprehension, in addition to conversational skills. ELLs are given the DOE word to word bilingual  glossaries in their native languages to use in their classrooms and a second copy to use at home. Students have access to word  to word bilingual dictionaries to use in their classrooms and to use on the state exams. The library has native language books  available and the ENL teachers have native language books in their classrooms.    In addition, the ENL teachers will have tablets and a laptop to be used with their ENL population. Through current translation  apps, students will be able to research, translate, and read passages in their native language to ensure understanding.  Students are always encouraged to maintain their native language skills while they are acquiring English skills.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Our school makes an initial determination of the home language support need of each newly enrolled ELL based  on information from the Home Language Identification Survey, the informal interview with parents and students conducted by  an ENL teacher during registration, and the NYSITELL results. Our ENL teachers work closely with the classroom teachers to  make adjustments throughout the year.  We work to ensure that our newly enrolled ELLs receive home language support in  the classroom and that they're able to participate alongside their peers despite the language barrier.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59        Teachers provide buddies/partners who speak the same native languages for newly enrolled ELLs.  Teachers in the building  who speak various native languages also serve as translators for newly enrolled ELLs. The school library provides bilingual and  native language books in the ELLs' native languages.  The Imagine Learning English computer program provides native language  support for newcomers. In addition, ELLs are provided with word to word bilingual dictionaries and State Ed Department  provided bilingual content area glossaries. In addition, each ENL teacher has a number of tablets with language learning  and translation apps to be used in the classroom.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    The main focus of our ENL program is to ensure that students attain English proficiency and are able to function successfully  and independently in the classroom. Entering and emerging students learn basic communication skills (so that they may  interact with their peers and staff more easily) and fundamentals of English-language acquisition, whereas the transitional and  expanding students focus more on comprehensive individual English-language acquisition needs — specifically the reading and  writing strands of the Common Core Standards.  Teachers across the school help ELLs by using ENL strategies and materials  that are directly tailored to students' ages, grade level and language acquisition needs.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    N/A     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Our school assists newly enrolled ELLs and their parents through school open houses and ENL parent orientations at the  beginning and ongoing throughout the school year. Teachers are available during our open houses to answer any questions  that parents might have regarding our school. The ENL parent orientation is hosted by our ENL teachers.  ELLs and their  parents have the opportunity to ask any questions that they might have regarding the three ENL programs available in  NYC.  The parent coordinator and translators are present at the ENL parent orientation as well.      Throughout the year, the parent coordinator provides parents of ELLs with information regarding various workshops that are  available in NYC.  Our school counselor hosts a high school application information session, with translators, for middle school  students and their parents. There are also parent engagement workshops and family workshops organized by our ENL teachers  and the parent coordinator throughout the year.  There are translators available during all parent engagement activities and  parent meetings to ensure that newly enrolled ELLs and their parents receive all the information and assistance that they need  in order to transition smoothly into the NYC public school system.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Spanish is offered to 7th and 8th grade students.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  PS/IS 229 offers ELL Professional Development to all ELL personnel at the school. C.I.T.E. is the professional development  provider. Each session introduces a new topic such as ENL methods, curriculum, English acquisition theories, successful ENL  classroom and co-teaching methods. Some prior ELL PD sessions were titled "Engaging ELLs and Immigrant Students Through  Rigorous and Relevant Instruction" and "Scaffolding and Collaboration: Increase Academic Achievement for ELLs and  Immigrant Students".      New teachers are also sent to special professional development days sponsored by the network or Department of Education  for ENL training.  Other topics include the process of second language acquisition, content area strategies, and how cultural  differences impact teaching and learning.  ENL teachers are also a resource for all teachers on the staff as they constantly  model appropriate ENL methods and work closely with the classroom teachers to ensure they are addressing the needs of the  students.    As part of a District 20 initiative, we are beginning an ELL Inquiry Team, focusing upon one grade, as determined by an analysis  of NYSESLAT, NYS ELA & NYS Math exams from Spring 2018.  Teachers of ELLs, including official class teachers, will be a part of  this group.    Teachers of ELLs are encouraged to attend outside professional development workshops provided by Brooklyn South Field  Support Center as well as NYC DOE Office of English Languages Learners training sessions relating to language  development,  integration of State learning standards into the ENL programs, co-teaching models, etc. They also attend  workshops that showcase new research related to second language acquisition. Some PD workshops attended featured RTI in  the classroom, new ELL strategies, video clips of best practices, utilizing self reflection, and scaffolding strategies. Teachers of  ELLs and particularly the ENL teachers then turn-key the information they learned to the classroom/content area teachers so  all staff is on the same page and all staff is familiar with current ELL strategies, differentiating for the ELLs in the classroom,  aligning curriculum to the State standards, making the curriculum accessible to the ELLs based on their language needs.       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  PS/IS 229 recognizes the importance of ELL specific ongoing professional development. The ENL staff attends numerous PD  workshops given by the DOE and district regarding ELLs. Records are kept from the ELL workshops and information is  disseminated with all the ELL providers in the school. In addition, 10 hours of explicit ELL PD is conducted in the school to the  ENL Staff by C.I.T.E (Center for Integrated Teacher Education). To meet identified student needs, we will include training on  writing across the curriculum areas with a particular focus on ELLs and immigrant students. All teachers of ELLs were provided  with 10 hours of explicit ELL training via workshops and/or classroom visits.    As part of a District 20 initiative, we are beginning an ELL Inquiry Team, focusing upon one grade, as determined by an analysis  of NYSESLAT, NYS ELA & NYS Math exams from Spring 2017.  Teachers of ELLs, including official class teachers, will be a part of  this group.In all our other Inquiry Teams, teachers will focus upon finding new research-based strategies to meet the needs of  students, including particular ELLs, as identified in each team's action plan.                 2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61        Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   In addition to parent-teacher conferences and mandated parent orientation meetings, ENL teachers will have ongoing  individual meetings with the parents/guardians of ELLs on Tuesdays after school during parent engagement time. These annual  meetings are comprehensive and are used to discuss the goals of the ENL program, language development progress, language  proficiency assessment results and language development needs. Attendance will be recorded. Qualified interpreters will be  provided by the school if needed. The school has a multi-lingual school translation team that is available for individual  meetings and phone calls. The school members on the translation team represent the main languages in the school. If the  members of the team cannot provide the translation, then the school will contact the DOE translation unit.     This time is used to get to know the parents/guardians and learn information to help inform instruction. Information is  gained about the prior education of the students and the current educational needs based on parent/guardian observations at  home. Parents/guardians are supported so the school, teachers and parents/guardians can work together in partnership to  best address the academic and social/emotional needs of the child.    Exam results are shared with parents/guardians. Trends in exam data are discussed and analyzed. Current and past classroom  performance and progress are discussed. A discussion is held concerning ways to help assist the child and family so an  environment is created and/or maintained at home that promotes the conditions for language acquisition. Educational goals  are discussed that depend on current and past academic performance. EDAT data is shared if a child is deemed at risk and  discussions are held to come up with targeted educational solutions to help address the individual classroom academic  and language acquisition needs.               2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Parent involvement for all families including families of ELLs is highly encouraged through membership on the PTA, its  executive board and sub-committees, by election to the School Leadership Team, and by participation in family events for  parent/guardian and child.     Workshops are planned for all parents but in particular, the parents/guardians of ELLs to encourage parental involvement and  to develop a strong relationship with the school. Translators are provided as needed at workshops. Measures are taken so the  parent's of ELLS feel comfortable and accepted into the school community. Some potential future ELL workshops address:  opportunities to learn English together at home as a family, keeping up with classroom assignments for struggling students,  specific strategies to learn English and ways to communicate with the child's teacher and school community if English isn't  spoken well.    In addition, parents are strongly encouraged to join their children on school trips. Activities are held to get the parent's  involved and to raise money for the school. Some activities are the school Carnival, PTA Auction Dinner, Harvest Walk-a- Thon, Spring Concert, and the Art Show. In addition, the ELL families are invited to all school wide workshops. Some workshops  planned for this year are: Curriculum Night, Middle School and High School Application Process.     The Parent Coordinator is involved with all workshops. She ensures the content, materials, publicity, and oral presentations  are translated when possible and in the home language of the parent's attending. She also works closely with the ENL teachers  to find out translation needs and makes constant use of the school translation team.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62      Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Robert Zappulla, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   P.S./I.S. 229K                                                                              School DBN: 20K229  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      P.S. /I.S.229K is a diverse PreK-8 school with many parents/guardians who speak a language other than English at  home. This diversity contributes to a rich educational atmosphere, but also presents many challenges. Effective  communication with parents is one of the many challenges. According to the September 2018 ATS Home  Language Report, English is the home language of ____ of the families at the school. We recognize the importance  of parent involvement in their child’s education and continue to strive to eliminate communication barriers  between parents and the school.    These are some formal and informal measures that are currently in place to identify both written and oral  communication/translation needs:    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66         Blue Cards:   Every child in the school has a Student Emergency Contact card (aka "blue card") on file filled out by their  parents/guardians. The blue card has a specific section where the parents must specify their preferred written  and oral language of communication. The parents receive these cards initially at their child’s registration and  during the first week of school when blue cards are updated. The cards are distributed in English and translated  cards are distributed in the child’s home language. If a student’s home language is not represented on one of  these translated blue cards, then all efforts are made to find a translator to assist.       The school's parent coordinator, using ATS information, tabulates the exact written and oral interpretation needs  of each student/family school-wide. This information is then shared with appropriate staff so the correct  DOE/school translated forms will be sent to the appropriate parents throughout the school year and effective  communication can occur with families during parent/teacher contact situations.      The RCPL (Parent's Preferred Languages Report) ATS report is run so the school will know the exact numbers and  percentages of the school population who have requested either oral or written communication and in what  language they prefer. The Home Language Report ATS report is run so the school will have an accurate count of  the home languages represented in the school and the report is compared to previous years to determine trends  in the data.      The Multilingual In-House Translation Team:    The school also has a multilingual in-house translation team comprised of school staff. The team has members  that are fluent in the majority of the languages spoken by the school population (Mandarin, Cantonese, Arabic,  Spanish, Albanian and Russian). Also, a number of multilingual parent volunteers are willing to assist with advance  notice. Through the team's interactions, additional language translation needs of the parents are determined.    Home Language Information Survey (HLIS):    Upon entry into the NYC DOE, every new student's family is given (in English and in the appropriate home  language) the HLIS as part of the registration welcome kit. Like the "blue cards," there is a section on the HLIS  asking the parent/guardian to state the preferred written and oral language of communication. If a student  transfers into the school from an existing NYC school, the HLIS is sent from the prior school and is examined upon  arrival. The HLIS and the blue cards are the formal indicators for both the school and individual teachers to meet  the particular translation needs of parents/guardians.    As in any school environment, there are times when staff members end up speaking or meeting with other family  members in addition to the parents/guardians. The blue card or HLIS might indicate the parent/guardian’s  preferred language of communication, but a grandparent for example, might require an interpreter. Teachers,  administrators, and office staff often have to informally speak with (sometimes with the help of an interpreter)  the students and caregivers to find out if there are any additional translation needs that are not present via ATS  reports or on the blue cards/ HLIS. In addition, at the beginning of every school year, classroom teachers ask their  students if there are any additional translation needs to support the home-school connection.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67      Using these formal and informal methods, staff members throughout our school community seek to have an  accurate account of the preferred language and method of communication of our students and their families.         2.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      In the event of an emergency, our school will utilize our online applications: (1) Skedula/PupilPath emails and  messenger service translates automatically according to the ATS home language communication preferences  identified by our families; and (2) our school webpage (www.PS229.org) allows the viewer to select their preferred  language. We also have staff members able to assist families who speak Albanian, Arabic, Cantonese, Greek, Hebrew,  Hindi-Gujarati, Hungarian, Italian, Mandarin, Russian, Serbian, and Spanish.            Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      Chancellor's Regulation A-663 will be included in the Staff Handbook which is given to the teachers and discussed  upon arrival on the first day of school. The importance of parental involvement/access and the need to minimize  communication barriers will be emphasized. Teachers and office staff will have access to a folder with all DOE  translated forms and a master list of forms that were translated in house to be used throughout the school year. Staff  will be given the list of the multi-lingual in-house school translation team members and encouraged to contact team  members when immediate oral or written translations are needed. In addition, teachers will have access to the ATS  generated information showing the home languages and oral/written preferred language of communication of the  children in their classes.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73         Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      The welcome posters will be displayed in all covered languages at the main entrance. The Parents' Bill of Rights and  the Parents' Guide to Language Access will be displayed and accessible in the main office. The Language ID Guide is  located at the security desk and also in the main office. Attempts will always be made to provide translators at parent  engagement events and meetings.      Due to the variety of language assistance services and translation options available, parent/guardians will continue to  feel welcome and the importance of their engagement and partnership with the school/staff will continue to be  encouraged.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       It is important not only to identify the preferred language of communication, but also to determine the unique needs  of the various populations within our school community. Each year, there are ongoing discussions held among staff,  including the administration, teachers, paraprofessionals, parent coordinator, PTA, School Leadership Team, office  staff, parents/guardians and students to identify any additional communication challenges and  translation/interpretation needs of non-English speaking parents/guardians. The school attempts to be proactive and  addresses any new concerns that arise. Two new bilingual (Mandarin and Cantonese) school aides were hired and  were very useful in minimizing communication barriers.      Communication needs are discussed at parent orientations so each teacher and the parents/guardians are on the  same page and all are aware of the best ways to communicate effectively. P.S./I.S. 229K strives to be open and  inviting, promoting an atmosphere where all may feel welcome and comfortable in sharing their communication  needs.    P.S./I.S. 229K encourages feedback. The ENL teachers are in close contact with staff, including the teachers and the  administration, attempting to bridge any communication gaps between caregivers and the school. A survey in  September will be distributed asking parents about their language needs and determining interest in potential ENL  classes for adults. The Parent Coordinator and the PTA provide feedback regarding families' needs to the  administration and to the School Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT addresses the school's communication services, as  well as reviews related data in the annual School Survey.   Direct parent feedback will impact potential changes for the upcoming school year. In 2017, Title III parental  engagement money was used for evening ENL workshops designed to help facilitate English acquisition in the home.  Next year, the results of a parent/guardian survey will help pinpoint current language needs and interest in adult ENL  classes.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74             2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          75
