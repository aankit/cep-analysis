This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   PS 96 is a diverse school community that is committed to creating and fostering a safe, educational environment that  is conducive for all learners.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   Public School 96, The Richard Rodgers School, is located in the Northeast section of the Bronx. Our school services an  ethnically diverse population of students from Kindergarten through Grades 5. According to the 16-17 School Quality  Snapshot enrollment is 955 general education and special education students. Our student demographics are 4%  Asian, 24% Black, 62% Hispanic and 9% White.       We strive for our students to come to school every day. The average student attendance at P.S. 96 is 92%. We  recognize our students’ good attendance every year by awarding certificates and pins at a special assembly  celebration. Our students’ good attendance has a positive impact on their learning and builds their self-esteem.    We have partnerships with the Leadership Program, Stella Adler and NIDC as part of the 21 st CCLC Grant. These  community based organizations provide our community (students and staff ) with in school as well as after schools  programs. The programs provide our students with academic intervention, violence prevention, dance, chorus,  drumming, sports and theater enrichment. They provide our staff with professional development workshops.    We have one to three Integrated Collaborative Teaching classes on each grade and four self-contained Special  Education classes in order to better serve our students with disabilities. The use of ICT classes has exposed our special  education students to additional academic stimulation and socialization and we have seen many students benefit  both academically and socially from this setting.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   English Language Learners make up 9% of our population and we have 21% students with special needs.          4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Looking at the Framework for Great Schools, one of our many successes has been to maintain a positive and  supportive learning environment. Through our daily reciting of our school’s pledge and our various school wide  celebrations-Books Come Alive, Reading Your Hearts Out, Get Caught Reading, 96th Day of School Celebration, Dr.  Seuss Day, Star Student of the Month, 100% Attendance Awards along with individual class celebrations in writing,  our school has come together as a family to celebrate our positive learning environment. We continue to strive for  successful classrooms and effective teachers by using the Danielson Framework for Teaching. Danielson is used to  evaluate and analyze observation data and provides teachers with feedback to enhance their professional growth and  pedagogical skills.      We continue to collaborate in teacher teams, analyze student work/assessments and develop lessons so that all  students are successful. In order to build learning communities amongst teachers, we have joined an Instructional  Focus Cohort through our District and take part in visiting other schools and learning from each other.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10         In continuing to build even stronger family-community ties, we plan to continue to build more school wide family  night events. On Family Nights, parents and students are invited to come back to school and have fun. This last year,  we had a "Parent Night" and planned approximately 16 different activities for parents to enjoy. Participation has  improved and parents enjoyed the opportunity to bring their child back to school for “fun learning events” as well as  having a parent alone night.   For the 2018-2019 school year, our key areas of focus will be to continue to improve student outcomes through  coherent instruction and build stronger family-community ties. By analyzing student work and assessments,  enhancing our curriculum and collaborating across the grades, we will strive to create confident and independent  learners. In addition, we will continue to focus on the early elementary grades in order to prepare them for the  academic challenges they will encounter in the upper grades.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 11X096   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   0K,01,02,03,04,05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   952   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     One of the Six Elements of The Framework for Great Schools focuses on rigorous instruction. Rigorous instruction in  schools need to be customized, inclusive, motivating and aligned to the Common Core. Standards need to be high for  all students and they must be actively engaged in intellectually stimulating activities. Based on the School Quality  Guide Report 2017-18, our school exceeded the City's average in Common Core Shifts in Literacy (99%), Math (99%).  In the Quality Review (2017-18), we received an overall rating of Proficient in Instructional Core components and Well  Developed in School Culture components.      We will continue to improve our ELA curriculum by embedding writing (Benchmark's Writing) along with the  Expeditionary Learning and Ready Gen programs, mandating independent reading into the daily flow of the day for all  students. Based on the 2016-17 NYS Math assessment, only 31 % of all of our students in grades 3-5 were on grade  level, which indicated to us that we need to revisit our math block. During the 2018-2019 school year, we will  continue to use Houghton Moughflin, a supplementary resource for teachers in Kgn-Gr. 5, in order to assure that  students are meeting mastery in math. As part of the District 11 initiative, we will be departmentalize our fifth grade  and participate in summer professional development on Algebra for All. Our goal is for teachers to improve their  content knowledge and set up classrooms where instructions is of an explorations style and students become more  creative in their problem solving. We will continue to use two technology programs, one in Math, Dreambox and one  in Math/Literacy, i-Ready, which places students on their level and then supports them in order to advance to the  next level. Fundations was added to Kgn-Gr. 2 classes in order to better support the lack of phonemic awareness and  phonics in those grades.    Strengths:   Teachers get to know their students by looking at data in order to drive instruction and meet the needs of their  students   Collaboration amongst teachers on the grade   Curriculum and lessons are coherent with structure and are aligned to the CCLS   Use Foundations and Be a Better Reader in Kgn-Gr. 2 support students in phonemic awareness   Use of Benchmark's Writing program exposes students to a variety of writing genres   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13      Continue to strengthen the math block including building on the work of the IFC and District 11 initiative   Promoting classroom discussion amongst students in order for students to articulate understanding    Teachers provide students with actionable feedback in order to help student learning    The use of i-Ready and Dreambox data has shown that many students are using the program in school/home and has  helped students with their comprehension/math skills          Needs:   Continue to embed independent reading in all grades   Provide quality professional development in guided reading time   Consistent progress monitoring of IReady and Dreambox and analyze data gathered for next steps   Share Dreambox and IReady programs with parents so they can be used at home   Customized professional development in order to improve content knowledge in the area of math/literacy   Begin to introduce emotional/behavior support system for students in need   Continue to enhance instruction in areas 3D, 1E and focus on 3C.   Our priority is to enhance our existing literacy and math blocks to better prepare our students to become more  proficient readers, writers and mathematicians.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   By June 2019, 75% of students on each grade will move a minimum of two Fountas and Pinnell levels.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and  strategies your school will implement to achieve the  identified goal for this Framework for Great Schools element,  including:   Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

It provides  teachers/administrators and parents with data informing them  of sts. strengths and areas of concerns, plus what specific  instruction is needed to improve.   Dreambox is an adaptive on line Kgn-5 math program proven  to raise student achievement. Students are tested and placed  in standard based lessons in order to achieve mastery in  concepts and skills.   More small group instruction (guided reading) time will be  implemented throughout the week, allowing more time for  independent reading.   An AIS person will be supporting grades Kgn through 5,  focusing on students who are experiencing difficulty in reading  and those who have been identified as hold overs.      In order to support families to gain a better understanding of  what is rigorous instruction, the school will hold 1-2 meetings  focusing on CCLS and Fountas and Pinnell Grade Level  Expectations chart   Grades Kgn- 5   Sept. 2018- June 2019   Administrative  team, teachers and                                        Grades Kgn- 5   Sept. 2018- June 2019   Grades Kgn.- 5 students   Sept. 2018 - June 2019   Curriculum Assoc.  consultant for  professional  development         Administrative  team, teachers,  math AIS team,  consultant   Teachers Kgn-5   Kgn-Grade 5               All parents   Sept 2018-June  2019, with 6  weeks intervals   Assistant Principal,  Parent Coordinator                           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15               Continuous use of Fundations will be used in grades Kgn-2 in  order to build phonemic awareness in students. Selective sts  will use Be A Reader, a phonemic reader allowing them more  practice to assist them since they have not mastered targets  by using Fundations.       SWD will use the SPIRE program, which has specific targets  that need to be met before progressing, initial consonants,  vowel sounds-long and short, fluency testing, etc. This  program has build in assessments which will be administered  by SETSS teachers.      ELLs will receive additional small group instructional time  other than their mandated required time, focusing on  vocabulary building, comprehension and writing skills as seen  on the NYSESLAT assessment.             3b – Parent and Family Engagement      Weekly  assessments  are done using  both  Fundations and  Be A Reader   Universal Literacy  Coach and  classroom teachers      Classroom teachers  and review by Univ.

Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible  for implementation and oversight.  At the first PA meeting (Sept. 2018), parents will receive information on the assessment methods used in school  which track students progress. Information about promotional decisions, report cards, etc are printed in the Parent- Student handbook distributed to each family in early September and throughout the year as parents register their  children. The school's Parent Coordinator is well versed in this information and is available for parents throughout the  school year. Monthly Principal letter updates parents on academic changes, new programs, etc. each month. During  the first week of every month, beginning in October through June, each grade will sent home to parents a newsletter  sharing recommendations/suggestions, books to read, where to find additional help, topics to be studied, support  resources for parents for literacy and math. Teachers also share samples of rigorious word problems, challenging  reading books and even at home project tips connected to what they are studying in class. During 2-3 PA meetings  November, February, April, parents have the opportunity to view work that is on grade so they may compare the  work what their child is doing. Parents also have an opportunity to learn the rubrics that their children use in class to  assess their work-Math Ninja, Glows and Grows, Red, Green and Yellow lights.

Teachers will be tracking the progress of students using Fountas and Pinnell levels from Fall to Spring. An interim  evaluation F&P, will be monitored in December and April to analyze if student reading goals are being met. In grades  Kgn.-5, our goal is for each student to increase a minimum of two reading level by the beginning of February 2019.  For math, the school will be using the interim assessments/performance tasks connected to Go Math and Algebra for  All (Gr. 5) which will include analyzing mid-chapter and end of chapter assessments. We will also be reviewing (on- going) students whose names are brought up to Response To Intervention (RTI) for possible referrals.     Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. (e.g. Performance Series, January  Regents, etc.)  Fountas and Pinnell benchmarks to be done in December and April. The midpoint mark will be that each child goes up  2 reading level each time the assessments are given. In Go Math performance tasks, teachers will analyze each end of  chapter assessments, along with the mid chapter tests to track how students are moving. Those students whose  average is below 65% will be referred to RTI for remediation.     Part 5c.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  In order to maintain a highly qualified staff at PS 96X, we strive to hire only the best-candidates who exhibit a passion  for their craft and a joy for all children. Teachers are always screened to make certain that they have a NYS license  and are assigned to their licensed area. Resumes are reviewed carefully by administration and teachers team. Initial  interviews are conducted by the administration team and candidates are asked to plan a demonstration lesson. Once  hired the team conducts formal and informal observations using the Danielson Framework for Teaching. Actionable  feedback is usually given within three days of an observation. An intervention plan is created if deemed necessary.  Support personnel are also made available to provide modeling, co-teaching, planning assistance or push in coaching.  New teachers are invited to participate in a "New Teacher Orientation". During this orientation new teachers are  given an overview of curriculum and given information to support them in our school. Professional development  opportunities are provided for teachers to build their pedagogical skills and instruction. Mentors are assigned to all  new teachers along with a buddy teacher. An Assistant Principal is in charge of monitoring the mentoring process.        2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   A range of strategies are utilized on a daily basis: coaching, modeling, co-teaching or an individualized plan with all  teachers focusing on the Danielson Framework for Teaching. All of these topics are addressed through professional  development for teachers as well as paraprofessionals. Other professional development is given on behavior  management, writing IEPs, Common Core Learning Standards and how to write a unit plan. Inter-visits are scheduled  on a need basis. We encourage teachers to share best practices informally as well as formally.        Part 3: TA Schools Only   3a.

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).  Future Kindergarteners and their parents are invited to an orientation in mid May or early June. Students and parents  have an opportunity to visit several kindergarten classes. Parents are given a packet of information with starting dates  and general school information. Parents and children have an opportunity to see the school uniform and are given  coupons for discounts. Students receive an educational gift and parents are shown how to help their child at home.  On the first two days of school, parents are allowed to enter the school and cafeteria area and meet their child’s  teacher and accompany any student who is having a difficult time transitioning.        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     A MOSL committee has been formed to make recommendations to the administration on the local and state  measures that would be used to evaluate teacher effectiveness. All staff members are then presented with the MOSL  committee’s recommendations. The principal then takes into consideration the recommendations of the committee  and makes final decision. Final decisions are shared with all staff members.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41        Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS96], in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      Public School 96X will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

Community  Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and  family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in  Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health &  Wellness.    Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s)   How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student  academic outcomes?   The CS strategy expands opportunities for students and parents in the home school. It helps the school build a more  supportive environment, strengthens family ties and reinforces trust. The after school programs assist students with  math and reading and enrichment opportunities while the before school activities provide assistance to families who  need early morning support school services. We hope that in December 2018 when our students are administered  Fountas and Pinnell test and mid year in house Math assessment, 50% of students enrolled in after school program  will grow one Fountas and Pinnell Level and achieve a minimum of a level 2 on the math mid year.     Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to  be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.    By June 2019, 50% of the students enrolled in the after school program in math and reading, will have progressed 2  levels on Fountas and Pinnell and achieved a level 2 in the end of year in house assessment.         Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Community School Annual Goal(s):  How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family  Engagement, and Health & Wellness--support your academic goals for students?  Our academic goals states that each child will grow a minimum of two Fountas and Pinnell reading and decrease the  number of level 1 students in grades 3-5 on the NYS Math assessment.

Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use.  Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work.   1. In July 2017, a Community School Director was hired from a pool of candidates. Throughout the summer, the newly  hired director worked closely with school based Assistant Principal Liaison and Parent Coordinator in order to become  familiar with the needs of the community, school, parents and students. Based on the needs assessment, data was  analyzed and program ideas began to take shape, as per allocation guidelines.       2. Based on student needs, data analysis and availability of services, the team along with The Leadership Program, Inc.  began to develop a menu of possible services. Once the school year began, students were chosen based on their  needs and invited to various programs. Teachers applied to work in various after school positions.   Daytime programs were chosen based on school needs. Staffing for these programs was made through The  Leadership Program. In collaboration with The Leadership Program, the following programs were decided upon:  Bilingual Birdies, Lunchtime Tutoring, Open A.M. Gym, Drumming and Dance, Stella Adler-Violence Prevention,  ELA/MATH Afterschool Intervention, Theatre, Dance, Sports Afterschool Club and twelve Parent Workshop on various  topics. Based on the needs assessment, the school needs to create an afterschool early emergent ESL academy. The  students from the academy will be emerged in language and academic vocabulary.       3. The Community School Director attends the monthly PTA membership meetings, where he updates parents on the  progress of The Leadership Inc. program and informs them about upcoming events. At these meeting the School  Director has an opportunity to obtain feedback from parents and then shares these concerns / Ideas with the school  team. In addition, monthly coffee chats are held between the guidance counselors, parent coordinator, community  school director and parents. During these coffee chats, parents have another opportunity to have a "voice" in sharing  their ideas and concerns.      4. Ongoing meetings are held between the school director, assistant principal liaison, CBO directors, parent  coordinator and grant manager in order to discuss and analyze programs strengths and weaknesses and make  appropriate adjustments if needed.

There are ninety-three  English Language Learners, which represents 9.9 percent of the school population. While 23 of  the 2017 NYSESLAT test takers scored commanding and 43 advanced at least one or more  proficiency levels,  21 students either remained the same or regressed.  These students will  benefit from supplemental instruction to accelerate language development, build background  knowledge and vocabulary, and improve literacy skills. Approximately 40 ENLs will participate  in the after school Title III program. There will be four groups of students in grades 3-5 (one  group of grade 3, one group of grade 4, one Entering group which consists of 4th/5th graders and  one group of grade 5 students). The program will begin on Wednesday, January 9, 2019 and  continue through Thursday, April 25, 2019. There will be 28 sessions.  Classes will meet each  Wednesday and Thursday from 2:25 p.m. to 4:25 p.m. Instruction will be in English with native- language support as needed. Three teachers holding permanent ENL licenses, Christine Torres,  Melissa Carroll and Albert Lopez will provide instruction. Mary Vaughan will provide content  area instruction.  Academic initiatives for ENLs will be provided in the form of activities and  instructional materials to extend and enrich literacy skills acquired through the daily literacy  block. Students will be provided materials which reinforce practice in the listening, speaking,  reading and writing modalities. This will include Language Power, Building Language  Proficiency, a differentiated resource which provides instruction in the four language domains.  Building Fluency through Reader's Theater, will give students the opportunity to read scripts and  perform, while connecting to content areas of science, social studies and art. Students will also  use Finish Line For NY ELL's, which is a standards-based ENL instructional series to assist  ENLs in practicing for the NYSESLAT.

This will occur during Tuesday afternoons' parental involvement time, and will  be extended and supplemented through Title III funds for a total of ten one-hour sessions from  2:25-4:25 (October 2, October 9, October 16, October 23, October 30, November 13, November  20, November 27, December 4 and December 11) with certified ENL teachers Christine Torres  and Melissa Carroll. The core objective of this program is to include parents and their children in  literacy activities in order to develop strong literacy in both native language and English in a  variety of topics, i.e. conventions of print, phonemic awareness and comprehension and the  reading/writing connection. Parents practice the various activities and are provided with  additional activities to practice and complete at home. Children are also given books to take  home (English and Spanish) at each workshop in order to develop their own home library  (materials and books provided at no cost to Title III program)    Additionally, parents of students participating in the after-school Title III program will be  offered two 90-minute workshops from 3:20-4:50 (April 2, April 9) by teachers  providing instruction. Parents will receive educational resources in helping their children at  home. These workshops will aid and support parents by providing them with the necessary tools,  strategies and approaches they can implement at home with their children.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  The Fountas & Pinnell (F&P) Benchmark Assessment System (BAS) is used to assess the early literacy skills of our ENL students  twice per year; in the fall and in the spring. This assessment matches students' instructional and independent reading abilities.  An oral language component asks students to repeat words and sentences. Letter and sound recognition is assessed as well as  sight word knowledge and early literacy behaviors, for example, knowledge of front and back of book and recognizing the  order of reading. Along with the F & P assessment, the Spanish Language Assessment Battery (LAB) results which demonstrate  native language literacy skills are analyzed and considered. Our school also uses the New York City Measure of Student  Learning (MOSL).   NYSESLAT testing data is also used and the EDAT assessment tool is used to analyze results.  Curriculum  embedded performance tasks are used to develop students' understandings of the content they are currently  studying  this helps the teachers assess how well students are mastering the current concepts and skills.  Formal and informal   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      assessment is used by teachers during the learning process in order to modify teaching and learning activities to improve  student outcomes.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The data from these assessments are used to plan instruction based on students' strengths and weaknesses. Data is also  analyzed to gauge how well students are acquiring phonemic awareness, foundational and language skills, developing  vocabulary, processing text and building comprehension. Small leveled groups (approximately 6:1 teacher to student ratio) are  formulated based on student levels.  The data also drives our school's literacy instructional plan. It provides evidence of learning and achieving. It alerts us as to  which students should be considered for intervention. These students will get Academic Intervention Services (AIS) from Ms.  Gardner in Kindergarten, Ms. Siciliano in first grade, Ms. Recine in second grade and Ms. Nikaj and Carroll for third, fourth and  fifth grade.  Furthermore, small leveled groups (approximately 6:1 teacher to student ratio) are formulated based on the data.  In addition to ENL instruction, struggling ENL students are provided small group reading intervention on specific literacy  strategies.       3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  There are various ways we evaluate the success of our ENL programs. A school team including administrators, coaches and  teachers meet regularly during inquiry time and grade meetings to examine a variety of assessments and data. English as New  Language Learners' proficiency is evaluated on predictive and periodic assessments, including the ENL Periodic Assessment in  October and March,  baseline assessments, which gauge students' starting point at the beginning of the year, course or unit,  State ELA, Math and Science exams, and at the end of the year to show growth or improvement.  Measure of Student Learning  (MOSL) and the New York State Report Card informs us whether ENLs met Annual Yearly Progress (AYP). Each year Annual  Measurable Achievement Objectives (AMAO) based on assessment (NYSESLAT) results from the previous school year are  assessed. Student progess is also assessed through classwork/homework and informal assessments which provide an overall  picture of student skills, abilities and on-going progress.   The EDAT Assessment tool also allows us to see if there is progress  over time and by modality.        4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    The data from these assessments are used to plan instruction based on students' strengths and weaknesses. Data is also  analyzed to gauge how well students are acquiring phonemic awareness, foundational and language skills, developing  vocabulary, processing text and building comprehension. Small, leveled groups (approximately 6:1 teacher to student ratio)  are formulated based on student levels.  These groups are flexible and change according to on-going teacher assessment.  The data also drives our school's literacy instructional plan. It provides evidence of learning and achieving. It alerts us as to  which students should be considered for intervention. These students will get Academic Intervention Services (AIS) from Ms.  Gardner in Kindergarten, Ms. Siciliano in first grade, Ms. Recine in second grade and Ms. Nikaj and Carroll for third, fourth and  fifth grade.  Furthermore, small leveled groups (approximately 6:1 teacher to student ratio) are formulated based on the data.  In addition to ENL instruction, struggling ENL students are provided small group reading intervention on specific literacy  strategies.    Title III funds are used to provide ENL students with after school support.  The RLAT is used to help with grouping students  according to needed support in a specific modality.  Students attend 3-4 months of after-school yearly.       5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Administrators, support staff and teachers assess data to determine if and when it is necessary to adjust instruction. English as  a New Language Learners' academic achievement is compared to the overall school population to evaluate how they are faring  in comparison to their peers. If sufficient data establishes students are lagging or not making sufficient progress, the core  instruction is reviewed in order to ascertain whether it is ineffective or inappropriate for the student and adjustments are  made. Additionally, students are provided with increased interventions and activities targeted to their individual needs. Other  considerations may be intensifying the instruction, providing a smaller student to teacher ratio and/or supporting teachers   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         with new research based ideas to deliver instruction. We also reach out to parents in order to establish a home-school  partnership to benefit the student in his or her academic development and achievement.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   NYSESLAT 2017 results demonstrate there are 29 students that advanced one proficiency level, 11 that advanced two  proficiency levels, 3 that advanced three proficiency levels and 17 that remained the same proficiency level.  Five students  actually regressed one proficiency level.  Using the EDAT tool we can also see the modalities of strength and need of the  students who took the NYSESLAT in 2017.  Data patterns on both NYSITELL and NYSESLAT illustrate students need additional  instructional support in order to be able to articulate properly with native-like fluency in order to take part in a variety of rich,  structured conversations in a whole class or small group setting. The data also demonstrates some students need to build  listening stamina and to acquire listening proficiency in order to comprehend spoken English, respond to others, explain,  analyze and synthesize a variety of ideas. When analyzing the data along with the NYSESLAT Targets of Measurement (TOMs)  data reveals weaknesses in interpreting information from grade level literary and informational texts.  Analyzing reading and  writing modalities confirm some students need to build a stronger foundation in literacy skills, i.e. reading comprehension and  responding to text based questions. Further instruction and practice is needed to gain writing mastery skills to ensure students  are able to develop and organize their ideas and to correctly use conventions of standard English grammar. The data drives  instruction for teachers to provide learning activities to foster further development of these skills.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   NYSESLAT results are shared with ENL teachers and support staff during weekly common prep time.  On-going discussions  during weekly common prep time are held to use the data to drive the instruction for these students.  The EDAT is used to  provide a summary of our school’s status and students’ achievement and progress. The EDAT allows us to target instructional  programs to accelerate achievement among both ELLs and non-ELLs.  This information is used in the differentiation of  instruction and grouping.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   a. Our goal at P.S. 96 is to continue to provide quality instruction to ENL students in order for them to reach  English proficiency and achieve the same academic success as their peers. To accomplish this goal ENLs are provided  language support in the four modalities as well as strategies that teach and reinforce skills through the content  areas.  ENL integrated services are provided by C. Torres and V. Pergjini as a push-in model by collaborating with the  classroom teacher and co-teaching the ELA/Math content.  Stand alone is provided by C.Torres and V. Pergjini as a  pull out process using the RLAT to assess the need in the four modalities. Additionally, through Academic Intervention  Services, small group literacy support and content area instruction, individualized language instruction is provided.  Other means which will continue to be implemented to support content area instruction are during after-school  programs in reading, math and science, funded and supported through Title I, Title III and 21st Century funds.     b. Kindergarten through grade 5 ENLs, including special education students receive ENL instruction by certified ENL  teachers. ENL instruction is provided by classroom teachers, Ms. Carroll (Second) and Ms. Patane (Fourth).  Mr. Lopez  provides part time instruction to the ENL students as he holds an ESL certificate and not a Common Branch or content  area license. Ms. Torres will provide integrated ENL instruction to Mr. Lopez's third grade ENL students and Ms.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61         Padilla's fifth grade ENL students. Mrs. Torres also provides four periods of stand alone ENL services to Ms.  Padilla's fifth graders.  Kindergarten through grade 5 special education students in either ICT or self-contained classes  receive services from C. Torres/V. Pergjini for Integrated ENL. ENLs in these classes also receive additional English  Language Arts and the writing process from AIS reading teachers: Ms. Nikaj (grade 5), Ms. Carroll (grade 4 and grade  3), Ms. Recine (grade 2), Ms. Siciliano (grade 1) and Ms. Gardner (kindergarten). Mr. Cecil, Ms. Caetano and Ms.  Mehlig provide small group AIS math instruction and small group enrichment. Special Education/ENLs  are grouped by  grade and proficiency levels as assessed through NYSITELL and/or NYSESLAT.  Entering and Emerging students receive  two units (360 minutes) of ENL instruction. Transitioning students receive .5 unit of study in ENL/ELA and .5 unit of  study in stand-alone ENL or integrated ENL in a content area. Expanding students receive 1 unit of study in ENL/ELA or  other content area. Commanding students receive up to two years of support services. The instructional components  of the ENL program include English Language Arts and content area instruction in English through ENL  methodology.       b.  TBE program.  If applicable.           c.  DL program.  If applicable.            2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Ms. Garcia ensures all ENLs receive ENL instruction per CR Part 154.  Entering and Emerging ENL students are programmed in  STARS and receive two units (360 minutes) of ENL, 180 minutes of integrated ENL instruction and 180 minutes of stand-alone  ENL instruction. Transitioning ENLs are programmed in STARS and receive 180 minutes of ENL instruction, 90 minutes of  integrated ENL instruction and 90 minutes of stand-alone ENL or 90 minutes of integrated ENL instruction.  The expanding ENL  students are programmed in STARS and receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL instruction through the push in model.  Commanding students are programmed in STARS and receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL instruction in ELA or content area  or other services that are approved by the NYS Commissioner, that monitor and support the student's language development  and academic progress.  The staff ensures mandated number of instructional units are provided according to proficiency levels  in each program model, Ms.Torres provides stand alone and integrated services.  ENL integrated services are provided by C.  Torres/V.Pergjini as a push-in model by collaborating with the classroom teacher and co-teaching the ELA content.  Stand  alone is provided by C.Torres/V. Pergjini as a pull out process using the RLAT to assess the need in the four modalities.  Ms.  Carroll (Second), Ms. Patane (Fourth) and Mr. Lopez (Third) service ENL students within a self-contained setting.  The EDAT is  used to provide a summary of our school’s status and students’ achievement and progress. The EDAT allows us to target  instructional programs to accelerate achievement among both ELLs and non-ELLs.  This information is used in the  differentiation of instruction and grouping.  The EDUR update report is looked at monthly to ensure no students have been  overlooked or are missing from STARS.       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   In order for teachers of ENLs to meet the language development needs and demands of the Common Core Learning Standards,  they incorporate a variety of methods to make content comprehensible. In the integrated and stand-alone program models,  this may be accomplished through the use of visual representations of vocabulary and concepts. Teachers can access a variety  of visuals through Smartboards or I-Pads. Semantic story maps and graphic organizers are used in order for students to dissect  and organize information. Teachers link new information to students' prior knowledge as well as teach new vocabulary words  that occur in the text. Students often work in cooperative groups to have the opportunity to discuss academic vocabulary and  key concepts. The main concepts and vocabulary for a unit are posted and reviewed. Teachers differentiate instruction or the  assessment criteria as needed for the students. ENLs are also provided with bilingual dictionaries and content area glossaries  to review key terms or unfamiliar vocabulary related to the content.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   The Spanish Lab is utilized to assess newly identified Spanish speaking ELL's.  The New York State Education Department allows  for English as a New Language Learners/Transitional ENLs to utilize translated versions of content area exams, bilingual  dictionaries and/or glossaries. Additionally, students have access to these accommodations throughout the school year.  Students have access to native language materials in their classroom libraries as well as the school library. They are  encouraged to discuss content and/or write responses in their native language. Teachers who are knowledgeable of the  students' native language use the language to scaffold and support what is being presented.        5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status           a. Students with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE) receive additional support in content area instruction (through native  language materials, translated editions of content area exams, glossaries and dictionaries). Teachers provide oral translations  for support as needed. Students are pulled in a small group (8:1) for literacy and content instruction. Students with Interrupted  Formal Education are invited to the Title III after school program. Meeting with students' parents and key staff members are  held throughout the school year in order to support the home-school connection, and parental feedback is considered when  planning instruction.            b. Newcomers receive instruction through ENL methodology and strategies. In grades kindergarten, one, two, three and  four students are placed in ENL self-contained classes. These students receive ENL services based on English proficiency per  NYSITELL or NYSESLAT . Newcomers in grades k-5 receive additional literacy support through a pull out stand alone ENL  model.  Students receive instruction in communication skills through the four modalities for language development.              c. Four to six year ENLs continue to receive mandated services based on proficiency levels per NYSESLAT. Academic  Intervention Services are provided through push-in/pull-out reading and math teachers. Grade 3-5 ENLs are invited to the Title  I and/or the Title III after-school programs.             d. Long-term ENLs  are provided Academic Intervention Services in small groups, both in ELA and content area instruction.  They participate in the MYON and I-Ready technology programs in order to support ELA strategies at their individual reading  level. Long term ENLs are invited to the Century 21 and/or Title III after-school programs where they are provided ELA and  math instruction two days per week.           e. Commanding ENLs continue to receive .5 units of study per week of Integrated ENL in ELA or content area. We continue  to provide transition supports for two years in which a former ENL has been identified as Commanding per NYSESLAT.  New in  the 2018-2019 school year we will be implementing the Alternative Pathways to support Former ELL's language development  and academic progress.  They also participate in the MyON and I-Ready technology programs to support them at their  individual reading level. Students are invited to the Century 21 and/or Title III after-school ELA and math programs.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   During the 2018-2019 school year Houghton Mifflin's Go Math program will be used for kindergarten through grade 5  students. Math support teachers (Mr. Cecil, Ms. Caetano and Ms. Mehlig) pull out students (groups of six) for intervention.  Differentiation is incorporated into lessons in order to meet the needs of English Language Learners and Students With  Disabilities (SWDs). Students have opportunities to work in small partner groups to discuss and share their learning, allowing  for additional language development. Scaffolding instructional techniques such as visual and vocabulary supports, modeling  and to make learning comprehensible are provided for ENLs and SWDs. Students also receive native language support through  the use of translated editions of the Go Math Program.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63      In kindergarten through grade 2 Ready Gen is used during the whole class literacy block and Expeditionary Learning is used in  grades 3-5. Both programs facilitate the "close reading" process. Texts include a balance of literary and informational texts.  Students are required to interact with text to support answers with textual evidence. Students' daily writing activities are  connected to the text being read. Students read and write independently and in small groups to complete activities and  different forms of writing responses. Ready Gen and Expeditionary Learning support and scaffold learning for ENLs through  content specific vocabulary, suggestions and ideas teachers can follow in each lesson.  Fundations is used to lay the  groundwork for life-long literacy in grades K-2.

Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Materials to support content area instruction and activities are available to ENL students on their grade and/or proficiency  levels. The targeted intervention program in literacy is the Fountas & Pinnell Leveled Intervention System. Grade two students  use the Blue System, while grades 3-5 students use the Red System. Additional materials for ELA instruction and preparation  include: Ready New York CCLS (grades 2-5) and Understanding Complex Reading (grades 4-5). After school literacy materials  consist of People's Common Core, New York Ready Practice and Comprehensive Assessment of Reading Strategies (CARS).  Struggling at-risk readers receive Wilson instruction in small pull-out groups. The Wilson Program, a multi-sensory program is  utilized for at-risk ENLs in grades K-5.     The ReadyGen ELA program will be used in Kindergarten  through grade 2. The program provides ENLs with additional  vocabulary support of Spanish cognates, modeling and scaffolding suggestions helpful to ENLs. The writing component of the  program also provides teachers with suggestions in order to support ENLs. Kindergarten ENLs receive additional phonics  support through the Wilson Fundations program.

On Our Way to English is used for  kindergarten ENLs. This is an English language development program that includes instruction to develop academic language  and vocabulary, content based instruction, differentiated instruction for language and literacy and in oral language.     In grades 3-5 Expeditionary Learning is used to address CCSS ELA outcomes during a one-hour English Language Arts block.  Expeditionary Learning includes eight weeks of realistic fiction and non-fiction instruction modules broken up into three  shorter units. The focus of these modules is on building students' literacy skills as they develop knowledge about the world.  Students are assessed on independent work and group work on reading, writing, speaking and listening tasks. In order for  teachers to support instruction for ENLs, specific scaffold modeling and vocabulary scaffold suggestions are included.     New York ELL's Finish Line, which meets language needs and practice through the four modalities of Listening, Speaking,  Reading and Writing is also used in instruction for K-5 ENLs.     Kindergarten through grade five are provided daily instruction through Go Math. This program includes a Response To  Intervention (RTI)  and Reteach section in addition to the everyday instruction for intervention use. Three math teachers (Mr.  Caetano, Mr. Cecil, Ms. Mehlig) pull out small groups of students for additional intervention.      At-risk counseling is provided for students who are exhibiting social and/or emotional difficulties in school. Services are  provided on a one-on-one basis or in a small group setting. The goal is to prevent social and/or emotional problems from  impeding on academic progress.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Algebra for All will be implemented for the first time in the 2018-2019 school year.  The Departmentalization of 5th Grade  instruction is one of the initial strategies of Algebra for All. Research demonstrates that departmentalization enables us to  deepen the expertise of teachers while improving outcomes for students. This initiative focuses particularly on the content  that is critical to student success in their grade and essential for later work in Algebra I, and will also expand their repertoire of  strong instructional practices.     The ReadyGen ELA program was implemented in kindergarten during the 2014-2015 school year. ReadyGen is aligned to the  Common Core Learning Standards, ensuring all students interact with complex grade level texts. It facilitates students' learning  of academic vocabulary with a focus on Tier II and Tier III words that build knowledge of content domains and help ENLs to  internalize word-learning strategies vital to ENLs. It also includes close reading and foundational skills to further deepen  content knowledge and comprehension. ReadyGen also provides additional vocabulary support of Spanish cognates, modeled  scaffolding for ENLs, useful in supporting the needs of ENLs language development. The writing component of the program  provides writing suggestions to support ENLs.     In grades 3-5 Expeditionary Learning is used to address CCLS ELA outcomes during a one-hour English Language Arts block.  Expeditionary Learning includes eight weeks of realistic fiction and non-fiction instruction modules broken up into three  shorter units. The focus of these modules is on building students' literacy skills as they develop knowledge about the world.  Students are assessed on independent work and group work on reading, writing, speaking and listening tasks. In order for  teachers to support instruction for ENLs, specific  scaffold modeling and vocabulary support suggestions are included.     Technology programs implemented at PS 96 are I-Ready, Dreambox and MyON.  MyOn provides students with an enormous  amount of literary fiction and non-fiction texts at their individual levels, including text in Spanish. The programs use a smart  algorithm that determines the most appropriate learning activities geared specifically to meet the needs of each student.  I- Ready - A Diagnostic & Instructional program that was built for the Common Core. It provides the data-driven insights that  classroom teachers and school and district administrators need to determine exactly where to focus their instructional time to  ensure all students are on track to meet these more rigorous expectations and to succeed on the accompanying assessments.  Dreambox which is a Math Program that adapts to the individual learner by using continuous formative assessment in and  between lessons, analyzes over 48,000 data points per student, per hour to provide the right next lesson at the right  time.  Personalizes instruction from intervention through enrichment Strategically increases the learning velocity of struggling  students, advanced students, and on-level students.

Integrates assessment with instruction.  The ongoing capture of math gaps in student understanding  and filling them ensures that learners understand concepts before moving on to new lessons. Aligns with the Common Core  standards to make learning and teaching easier.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We have not had a bilingual program here for over 5 years, each of these years there has only been a handful of parents  choosing bilingual on the Parent Selection form.      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ENLs are afforded equal access to all school programs both during the core school day and in after school supplementary  programs. Students have access to small group instruction through Academic Intervention Services in ELA and content area  instruction. In addition to a Title III after school program, ENL students will participate in the Century 21 reading and math  after school program (2 days/75 minutes) per week which will begin mid-October 2018 and continue through mid April 2019.  Overall, students will have the opportunity to receive supplementary language, literacy development instruction, and test  taking preparation.       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  In English Language Arts a balanced literacy approach is applied. Leveled books are utilized for small groups, cooperative  groups and shared reading. This instruction supports the areas of listening, speaking, reading and writing. In kindergarten the  Sing Spell, Read and Write Program is used. The Writing Workshop model includes daily journal entry writing, pre-writing,  writing, editing and shared published pieces in a variety of genres. Teachers provide mini lessons to support writing skills and  strategies. Math instruction occurs through the Houghton Mifflin Go Math Program with additional support for Spanish  speakers through a translated edition. Science NYC/NYS scope and sequence is followed. Students are introduced to the  scientific method and prepared to complete a science project each spring. Social Studies instruction occurs through Scott  Foresman materials. New York Finish Line for ELL's is utilized for additional practice in the four modalities and preparing ENLs  for the NYSESLAT.     English as a New Language Learners have access to technology, either through scheduled technology classes with one of the  two technology teachers, and/or through the use of notebooks, I-pads and desktops in their classroom. Children have an  account that can be accessed in school and at home for additional benefits. MyON is another digital literacy program ENLs  have access to.  The program creates individual dashboards for students based on their specific interests and reading abilities.  Teachers and administrators are able to track students' reading activity and growth. This type of differentiated program is  particularly beneficial to ENLs as they are differentiated, allowing students to read and respond to comprehension questions at  their individual level of instruction.  Dreambox which is a Math Program that adapts to the individual learner by using  continuous formative assessment in and between lessons, analyzes over 48,000 data points per student, per hour to provide  the right next lesson at the right time.  Personalizes instruction from intervention through enrichment Strategically increases  the learning velocity of struggling students, advanced students, and on-level students. Provides access and equity for ELLs by  using rich visuals, sound design, and interactivity supports deep math comprehension.           13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Native language support is provided throughout the ENL programs where they are provided with a variety of language support.  Most teachers providing instruction are able to communicate and offer language and vocabulary support (in Spanish).  Additionally, students have class libraries and the school library to access native language materials and resources. ENLs also  have access to bilingual dictionaries and glossaries. They have simultaneous use of English and alternative language editions of  tests. Oral translators are provided for lower incidence languages when a test translation is not available in students' native  language.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66      Every effort is made to provide services and support which correspond to ENLs' ages and grade levels. Students' educational  backgrounds, age and proficiency levels are considered when forming groups. Groups are flexible, with change occurring  to  reflect student needs throughout the year. Transitional ENLs are supported throughout the school day as well as after  school for ELA and math. PS 96 is rich in both age and grade level materials and resources. While a number of ENLs may be  performing below grade level, there is a myriad of materials available to provide rigorous, academically challenging instruction  and learning opportunities to all ELLs. Teachers and students have access to a variety of fiction and non-fiction leveled text in  content areas in order to meet the needs of all students.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    We do not share a building.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Newly enrolled/pre-kindergarten ENL students and their parents are invited to an informational orientation each spring.  Students and parents are taken on a school tour, informed of programs available to students, provided with packets of  information in their respective languages and have an opportunity to pose questions of concern. Each September all parents in  kindergarten through grade 5 are invited to meet their child's teacher. They are informed of class procedures, rules, homework  and and other instructional areas of concern. Newly arrived students and their parents are immediately given the parent  orientation upon registration which includes a personal meeting and tour of the school.  These Parents are also invited to  family workshops in content areas and Partners in Print workshops for ENL kindergarten students and their parents. Parents of  ENLs are encouraged to participate in activities and events sponsored by the Parent Coordinator and the Parent Teacher  Association of P.S. 96 throughout the school year.         17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Although no language electives are presently offered, students have access to a variety of literary materials in various  languages, in their classrooms as well as the school library, which parents also have access to. Families are encouraged to read  a variety of genre from both their native language as well as in English. Parents who attend the Partners in Print workshops  receive free books during each session in Spanish and English in order to build their own home library for their children.       18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?            Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  ENL Coordinator Christine Torres and ENL Teacher Vesna Pergjini attend District 11 monthly Liaison meetings given by the  Bronx Field Support Center.  These meetings given by Michelle Bugay and Juan Otero include such topics as:  Targeted and  Strategic Instruction that Ensure Success for ENL's on the NYSESLAT, Identifying Tool for Assessing Language Acquisition,  Scaffolding Options for Teachers of English Language Learners just to name a few.  This professional development is then turn- keyed to the ENL staff during common prep times and inquiry meeting times.  Every available opportunity for ENL staff to  attend professional development outside of the building is also given.  Some professional development sessions attended this   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67      year include:  Practice Tools to Engage ENL's in Rigorous Instruction, Scaffolds For ENL's: Ensuring Access to Curriculum,  Targeted & Strategic Instruction for ENL's and What is different about an IEP for an ELL?   Professional development for non- pedagogic staff consists of 3 yearly Professional development sessions, topics included language and translation, ENL Basics  came and NYSESLAT Preparation.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Professional Development is conducted in a variety of ways for all staff at P.S. 96, including administrators, teachers,  paraprofessionals and related service providers.  Staff is sent out to professional development offered by the Department of  Education or other agencies, two common preps per week for every grade are utilized for teacher teams and professional  development time every Monday from (2:20 pm-4:00 pm) is used.  Records will be kept as follows: Agendas, sign-in sheets and  logs of meetings will be kept in the ENL Coordinators Compliance binder.    Professional Development provided will include: Datacation which will be implemented throughout the grades in order for  parents to become more knowledgeable of their child’s progress. By using this program, all assessment results will be more  transparent to parents.  In the core subjects, inquiry collaboration teams will meet to focus on student learning.  We will also  provide teachers with the support they need in addressing Danielson Component 3d through grade meetings, sharing of best  practices and professional development opportunities.     Additionally, the parent coordinator and secretaries attend staff conferences and district professional development in order to  specifically address language interpretation needs and compliance issues as it relates parents and students needs.       In order to meet the professional requirements as per CR Part 154.2 which consists of 15% of total hours  for all teachers, PS 96 will conduct 4 Professional Development sessions. These sessions will contain  agendas and staff will be required to sign in on an organization sheet. The professional development for the entire staff  consisted of:  Providing teachers with sound, essential approaches will afford students optimal conditions for second language acquisition.  Throughout the 2018-2019 school year, ENL teachers as well as classroom and content area teachers will attend professional  development workshops in the area of ENL methodology, accelerating vocabulary, supporting writing for ELL's, academic  language acquisition, Response to Intervention (RTI) across the content areas, and aligning the Common Core Standards with  the New York State ENL Standards. Additionally, teachers will attend various workshops offered by the Bronx Field Support  Center and the Office of English Language Learners. Teachers participating in the various professional development activities  turn-key elements of the sessions with other ENL and special education personnel.         Beginning in Fall 2018 through Spring 2019, grade 5 students including ENL students, their parents and staff of both P.S. 96 and  the prospective middle schools, will begin to become engaged in the transition process of moving students up to middle  school. The designated person, Ms. DeGuire, Guidance Counselor, meets with parents, teachers and students in order to  inform and provide all parties with valuable communication and information. Each students' individual academic, linguistic and  emotional profile is communicated to the intended middle school. Parents and students are invited to visit prospective  schools, and provided with opportunities to inquire of the academic and language programs available in order to make an  optimum decision for their child’s future. All of these initiatives are addressed in order to ease the transition process.                For meeting the specific needs of English learners, teachers will be provided Professional Development  during professional development and/or grade meetings, which are held twice a week.  The  professional development will be focused on the following topics:   1. Language progressions - How students learn language, both in terms of general language acquisition  and in terms of the acquisition of discipline-specific academic language;   2. Language demands - What kinds of linguistic expectations are embedded within specific texts and tasks  with which students are being asked to engage;    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68         3. Language scaffolds - How specific representations and instructional strategies can be used to help  students gain access to the concepts as well as to the language they need to learn; and   4. Language supports - How classrooms and schools can be organized to support students in continually  building a deep understanding of language and content.         Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Every Tuesday (2:20-3:15)  is a designated time towards parental involvement. This time will be utilized in meeting with  parents of ENLs to discuss goals of the program for their child, the language development progress, language proficiency  assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas. Besides this time, teachers meet with parents  before school, after school, during prep time and through telephone conversations.  Records will be kept as follows: Agendas,  sign-in sheets and logs of meetings will be kept in the ENL Coordinators Compliance binder.     Parents' preferred language is used during these meetings. Spanish and Albanian personnel assist with translations as needed.  The Translation and Interpretation Unit is utilized for lower incident languages.  Translators are also hired to translate the  Math and science exams in Arabic and French.     Parents' are also invited to use the "remind" app which allows the parent coordinator to send out messages and reminders in  English and in Spanish.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  Kindergarten ENLs and their parents participate in Partners in Print, a literacy program. The core objective of this program is to  include parents, teachers and children in literacy activities in order to facilitate the development of strong literacy in both  languages. Additionally, three one hour family workshops for grade one through five students will be offered in reading, math,  social studies, and science. These workshops will assist and support parents by giving them the necessary tools and strategies  to support their childrens' academic success. Additionally, 21st Century workshops have been designed for parents to learn to  support their childrens' literacy and math development. Within each workshop, parents learn effective reading and math  strategies as they and their children experience hands on learning situations. Parents are also provided with activities to  practice with at home with their children.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PS 96                                                                              School DBN: 11X096  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Translation and interpretation needs are assessed through various means. At registration parents complete the  Home Language Identification Survey. Parents are asked to state both oral and written preferences. In addition,  parents are asked to state preference of written and language communication at registration on the registration  application, on the Home Language Identification Survey's Parent Section, and on their child's emergency card.  Parents' preferred written and oral preference of communication is entered on ATS. The information is accessible  on ATS through the RAPL report which provides parents' preferred languages. We also access the RCPL report  which provides both written and oral communication preferences for ENLs and Non-ENLs. Additional  determination of parent written and oral needs are derived from Parent-Teacher Association meetings, Parent  Workshops and Parent-Teacher Conferences.

Flyers and documents can be read to families that are unable to read EnglishWe also inform parents that additional  information is available to them in the Parent Bill of Rights and Responsibilities, a copy of which is available in the  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          76      Parent Coordinator's office in room 166. Parents are informed during the parent orientation to use the NYCDOE  website for more information on translation and interpretation services. Translation services signs are posted in the  lobby of the main entrance and by the security desk upon entry into the school. LAC e-mail information is also  provided on the poster in the main entrance and security desk.   As noted from the translation unit: translation is the process of converting written text into another language (i.e.  flyers and letters are translated). Interpretation is the process of converting the oral part into another language (i.e.  in-person meetings and over-the-phone conversations are interpreted).           Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       We gather parent feedback from parents on the quality and availability of services in various ways. This occurs during  formal and informal communication between the school's administration, teachers, guidance counselors, parent  coordinator and other school personnel. We also gather and analyze parent responses from the parent survey  "Communication" section assessing whether they are satisfied with our school's expectations for their child's learning,  satisfaction with school's responses on questions or concerns they have about their child, and whether parents  believe they are properly informed of their child's achievements and successes.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          77
