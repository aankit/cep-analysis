This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      Jackie Robinson is dedicated to equitably developing the intellect, creativity, and emotional intelligence of all students  in a rigorous, inclusive and nurturing setting. We ensure readiness for college, career and life, were students are  empowered to think critically and independently, and are able to discuss, defend and substantiate their reasoning. In   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      every classroom, teachers use ongoing assessments to guarantee every students is engaged with authentic learning  experiences and work products.      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    At Jackie Robinson School (JRS) we promote a caring, respectful, multicultural environment. We share our cultural  backgrounds to nurture growth, responsibility, and productivity by celebrating our diversity within a positive school- wide atmosphere. We culminate our learning through a celebration of our cultures with our annual Promoting  Respect Integrity Diversity in Education (PRIDE) festival.    JRS has several partnerships. Some of our partnerships include: We continue to have our partnership with Trail  Blazers as part of their Under One Sky (UOS) After-School program which has expanded this year from a two day a  week program to a five day a week program. We will continue our partnership with the Caribbean Cultural Center  African Diaspora Institute After-School Program to bring dance, drumming and cinematography. We are able to offer  a full service dental clinic to all of our scholars because of our partnership with Lutheran Medical Center. We continue  our partnership with The Office of School Wellness and the Reebok Foundation to bring Cooperative, Healthy,  Activated, Motivated and Positive students (CHAMPS) to provide students with fun non-competitive activities.    Over the years JRS has seen an increase in the number of English as a new language (ENL) students and students with  disabilities (SWDs). At present 27% of our population are ENL and 28% of our scholars are SWDs.    For our SWD scholars we believe in the least restrictive environment and promote inclusion wherever possible. We  know that when children with and without disabilities participate and learn together in the same class positive  academic and social outcomes occur for all the children involved. With this in mind we strive to provide our SWDs  with the most inclusive learning experiences in core subjects as well as extra curricula activities. We continue to offer  ICT Pre-K class.    We continue to offer Departmentalized classes on grades 3-5. Since the start of our departmentalization during the  2016-2017 school year our scholars academic performance has increased in both ELA and Math.    We have expanded our STEM program this year by adding ten 3D printers, Nano the Humanoid and the STEM A+  Science cart to create our new STEM Lab. We know that STEM makes subjects fun and engaging.    Through our STEM Lab we are:   · Creating Inventors   · Bringing Art Back    · Engaging Reluctant Learners   · Creating Responsible Digital Citizens   · Hands-On Learning    · Building School Camaraderie    · Solving Real-World Problems    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      · Engineering design students can print prototypes   · History class can print out historical artifacts for examination    · Graphic Design students can print out 3D versions of their artwork   · Geography students can print out topography, demographic, or population maps      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   At present 27% of our scholars are ENL and 28% of our scholars are SWDs. Our ENL population would benefit most  from receiving instruction by license certified ENL teachers in both Collaborative Team Teaching (push-in) and pull- out/small group setting to obtain proficiency in language acquisition. This population has a need for more cultural  experience and exposure to be displayed amongst school community to promote and retain cultural pride, multi- cultural awareness and respect that supports positive social development amongst them and peers.    The needs of our SWDs are vast as some require more than others. Some of our SWD require more one-to-one and/or  small group instruction to build self-esteem, ability to retain information, and development of better social skills.  Some require both ENL and SWD services to address academic needs. We have students who display challenging  behavioral issues that are met by counseling service, one-to-one paraprofessional service, and behavioral  implementation plan.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   According to the School Quality Guide/ES we made the most progress in Collaborative Teachers. For the 2017-2018  school year we scored 96% which is an increase of 5% from the 2016-2017 school year when we scored 91%    For the 2018-2019 school year we will focus on Rigorous Instruction. For the 2017-2018 school year we scored 82%  which is a decrease from the 2016-2017 school year in which we scored 86%. Although we match the city average in  this element of the framework overall we still have work to do in the sub-components. In Literacy we are 2% below  the city, in academic press we are 6% below the city and for quality of student discussion we are 74% which is higher  than the city but lower than JRS expectations of 85% and above.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 17K375   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   387   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   YES   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

We also have a UFT Teacher Resource Center within the building. Lastly, we  have a central funded Universal Literacy Coach who provides support to teachers on grades K-2.    Professional development is continuously and openly offered to teachers from our UFT Teacher resource center,  central offices and JRS instructional core team through Professional Learning Community Plan.    Teachers are expected and welcomed to bring their own professional development interest to administration so they  can be supported in the further development of pedagogical skills. Activities to support teacher are Teacher Rounds,  Lunch and Learns and Book Clubs were teachers learn and share best practices.    Teachers are observed by administration to ensure quality instruction is on-going and provided with timely actionable  feedback. Meetings are conducted vertically and on grade bands to ensure continuous knowledge of learning is  shared. Newly hired teachers are provided mentors for the first years but if necessarily maintained beyond the first  year. Mentors are experienced highly qualified teachers that meet at scheduled times to provide guidance and  support.   It is a top priority of PS 375 to recruit, retain, and further support the development of highly qualified teachers to  provide quality instruction to its students. Prospective teachers’ resumes are screened before invitations to interview  are offered. Prospective teachers are interviewed by a school team consisting of Administration, UFT, Office Staff,  DC37 and parents. Even though the final offer is made by administration, input from school members are very critical  to ensure potential teachers are highly qualified.         2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   All staff members are provided high quality professional development opportunities on effective teaching practices.

Members are expected to turn-key newly obtained information to colleagues in a timely manner so the school  community is fully aware of updates. Model and Lead Teachers provide individual support to teachers through peer  inter-visitation, unit planning and lesson planning support.    Parent Coordinator regularly attends professional development directed towards providing greater understanding of  the Next Generation Standards and its impact on student learning to then turn-key this knowledge to parents in order  for them to better assist their child.   Teachers provide workshops for parents to better assist their child in being successful in their education, and socio- emotional development.   Paraprofessionals are included in the professional learning community professional development plan similar to  teachers to improve student achievement and quality instruction aligned to the standards.

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).  Beginning in May, preschool teachers begin implementing transition plans from Pre-Kindergarten to Kindergarten.  Students begin visiting Kindergarten classrooms for one period a day to observe the daily routines of kindergarten.  Parents are invited to Pre-K to Kindergarten Transition workshops to develop and deepen their understanding of  Kindergarten expectations. Kindergarten teachers meet with incoming kindergarten parents to share curriculum,  activities and events that students will be a part of in the upcoming year. Workshops for parents are provided by the  parent coordinator to engage parents and provide opportunities for parents to better understand and participate in  their child’s education. Pre-K teachers organize students’ records for kindergarten class in June.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34     4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.      The Instructional Core Team which is comprised of the Model, Lead, IEP and ENL Teachers along with the Universal  Literacy Coach, and administrators meet bi-weekly to discuss curriculum assessments and citywide assessments  (Benchmark Assessments, Performance Tasks, Critical Areas and F& P), professional development opportunities, new  school initiative such as student led conferences.   Teachers participate in semester aligned data days with administration to discuss patterns and trends in assessments  results and how they are using their data to drive instruction. Teachers are provided with assessment calendars that  outline key dates for all assessments used building wide and they include the grade wide assessments. Teacher Teams  meet weekly to discuss assessments and curriculum and develop a plan of action to tailor instruction to meet the  needs of all learners including ENL, SWD and Above Level learners.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35       Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. 17K375, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       Jackie Robinson School will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● Maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● Providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

Our ENL population, approximately 100 students,  is comprised of students who speak a variety of languages including: Spanish, Haitian Creole, Fulani, French,  Bengali, Twi and Arabic.  An analysis of the data, including students' performance in the  NYSESLAT (reflected in the EDAT Tool), MOSL ELA assessment (%growth), and F&P  running records indicate that in Kindergarten through Fifth Grade,  ENL students are not meeting grade level reading and writing standards. Therefor there is an immediate need  to strengthen and build a strong foundation in the reading and writing modalities.  Research has shown that increased oppertunities for meaningful conversation (requiring speaking  and listening skills) directly improves students reading and writing.    Therefore,  after school (ENL) students will receive direct literacy instruction following the Teachers College curriculum,  including Teachers College lessons and strategies targeted for English Language Learners (ELLs). As  mentioned since in  past years our ENL population has had difficulty meeting grade level reading and writing standards, after- school teachers will focus on literacy (reading and writing) along  with oral communication strategies (speaking and listening) to support their reading and writing skills.  The literacy and oral communication blended focus will be possible through the Teacher's College mini- lesson model. This model allows for students to receive direct instruction as well as participate in  peer cooperative learning. That means at each afterschool session students will receive  direct instruction with a teaching point that targets essential reading and writing skills as-well-as partner,  group, and class discusions.   The mini-lesson model will support students academically as it is also  the structure of their primary instruction during the day. Continuing the routines  while reinforcing  the strategies students are learning during the day,  while targeting specific literacy and communication skills that have been identified through a pre- assessment will best support our after school ENL population.  All ENL students are able to participate in the afterschool program as  they would all benefit from receiving literacy instruction with strategies that have been researched and validat ed as effective tools for English language learners. As ENL students often do not have the oppertunity to  practice their oral communication at home, the additional practice will also improve their literacy skills by  improving their speaking structure, incresing their vocabulary, together with their ability to say  and hear the sounds in the words will directly impact their reading and writing performance.   Thrive Academy  The creation and implementation of the Title III program, identified as Thrive Academy, will have a  direct benefit on our ENL student populations English language proficiency  and academic achievement.  Thrive Academy will be using a mini-lesson model to provide additional  academic content-area instruction afterschool in ELA, which will include literacy (reading and writing) as- well-as oral communication skills (listening and speaking) using ENL methodologies and instructional  strategies together with the Teachers College Curriculim and ENL supports. After  school teachers will have the Teachers College teachers guide set for grades K, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.  Reinforcing what students have learned during the day together with additional ENL strategies   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   during the afterschool program will make literacy content  comprehensible while giving students the oppertunity to develop their speaking and listening skills which are  not only part ofELA standards but will directly  help our students meet grade reading and writing common core state standards as-well-as supporting them to  improve their English language proficiency.  Instruction for Thrive Academy will be in English,  and follow the Teachers College Curriculum, all ENL students at PS 375 are elegible to attend. Students  will be divided into groups by grade band(K-1, 2-3, 4-5), groups subject to change based on  student registration per grade. The program will consist of two certified ENL teachers and one common  branch teacher. The program will be offered for 26 sessions starting November 29, 2018 to March 8,  2019 from 2.30 p.m. until 4.30 p.m.        Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.     rationale  teachers to receive training          schedule and duration      name of provider   topics to be covered   Begin description here:             About 20% of the school-aged population in our country come from immigrant families where a  language other than English is spoken (ENL population).  This has significant implications  for our school, which is no less diverse, such that every teacher at PS 375 is  responsible for providing instruction to ENL students.  It means that teachers will encounter a  diverse range of learners with varying needs.   If we are to see gains in our student acquisition of  English,  steady growth of their English proficiency and Annual Yearly Progress in academic  content areas, then  every teacher should have a sufficient breadth and depth of knowledge and  range of skills that will meet the unique needs of the range of these diverse English Language  Learners.  While there are ENL and bilingual teachers on staff who have expertise in supporting  ELLS, many teachers do not. With the plethora of information from new research and studies,  even our trained ENL and Bilingual teachers require professional development in order to  keep up with advances in ENL instruction and compliance.   Our ELLS are a subgroup of  students who require special attention because of their growing numbers and low performance  relative to their peers.   To help to satisfy this need teachers will be encouraged to participate in  professional development sessions to enhance their repertoire of skills in a variety of curricular  and instructional strategies including but not limited to: Culturally repsonsive teaching,  Teachers College reading and writing project.

NOTE: These are in addition to mandated activities, such as  parent orientation during ELL identification process.     rationale       schedule and duration      name of provider    how parents will be notified of these activities   topics to be covered   Begin description here:             Research has found that the level of parental involvement in a childs education is a  direct impact on that childs academic success. The improvement is found to be due to  many factors including improved behavior, attendance, and communication and interaction  between school and home. Parental input is very important in a school community, as  parents know their children best it is their fundamental right to  have input into their childs education.  When involved parents feel they are valued and believe  their opinions are being seriously considered, they: develop a positive attitude towards the  school, make an effort to be informed of important events,  and take more responsibility for their childs academic success, and are more likley to  volunteer their time and attend meetings.  In addition to the mandated activities such as parent orientations, parent conferences and IEP  meetings, we will foster healthy relationships with parents  by inviting them to join us in social  gatherings and informational events.  For example, the Celebration Dinner that is held at  the close of Thrive Academy This has been a  very successful, well received event where parents feel valued. We will also host an ENL Family  Night where we will show a movie and the have parents and their children do some  activities/games aligned to the movie content.  We will encourage parents to become volunteer  partners or community resources where they can.  Parents of ELLS who sit on the School  Leadership Team are invited to a forum where they are free to share their opinions or  concerns they wish to have addressed.  Written information will be sent by way of students, via  School Messenger or sent by mail. All communication going out to parents will be translated in  their preferred languages and written in a clear, concise way.  Where there is an oral exchange of  information, interpretation services will be provided by our multilingual staff or provided by the  DOE Translation and Interpretation services.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Early childhood uses a variety of literacy assessment tools. These include mandated formative assessments such as Fountas  and Pinnell as well as the performance task, end of unit tests and teacher-made assessments. According to the B.O.Y. Fountas  and Pinnell data, approximately one-third of the of the ELLS in Grades K-2 are approaching grade level standard or are  performing below grade level.  The data gives us insights into the effectiveness of the current interventions and makes clear  for us where the students are as well as to suggest ts where we need to go next.   From the data we can develop measurable,  relevant goals and objectives that address the needs of the students. With data we monitor progress, adjust methodologies,  plan instruction and form initial groups for small group instruction, as well as identify and determine what interventions  struggling readers need.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Individual needs are addressed in differentiated activites and daily RTI sessions.  At times we re-teach in small groups when  necessary. We pay close attention to the progress of individual students and adjust our approaches throughout the year. We  collaborate with other teachers and sometimes partner with the family in an attempt to meet needs of the student.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Evaluation of the success of program is based on students' progress, performance on The English Language  Learners Baseline  Assessment for Grades 3-5.  All grades will be assessed by the NYSESLAT, Fontas and Pinnell, teachers' checklists and  observations of students' progress in class work, portfolios, subject assessments and state tests.  Based on the data, the two  ENL teachers meet to discuss how the ELL students who are currently receiving English language development services are  progressing academically relative to program goals or expectations.  Teacher-teams meet during common planning sessions to  discuss and analyze student work and Ells are also discussed and their academic performance compared to other students  generally.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Individual needs are addressed in differentiated activities in class and in daily RtI  sessions.  At times we re-teach in small  groups when necessary. We pay close attention to individual students' progress and adjust our approaches throughout the  year.  We collaborate with other teachers and sometimes partner with the family in an attempt to enlist their support in  meeting the student's needs.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   When students from the ELL population are not performing at expected levels and are at risk for poor learning outcomes, we  consider the possibility that students are not receiving adequate instruction. We examine our teaching practice, the school  climate, and the types of programs created for students as well as student performance data from various tests. Once the data  is analyzed by Grade teacher teams.  We determine what each student’s unique needs are. Students are then placed in  groups  and goals are matched to the students instructional needs.   Progress is monitored based on specific benchmarks to inform  instruction. The data is also used to make important education decisions regarding evaluation for learning disability and  determining eligibility for special services.        6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].    A breakdown of the NYSESLAT scores of students from the EDAT, RLAT from ATS confirm researchers findings about second  language acquisition and learning. Listening and speaking skills are the first to be acquired. Three-fourths of our ELL population  scored at the expanding proficiency level in the listening and speaking modalities but scored deficient in the reading and  writing modalities. Reading and writing take much longer to develop and this is clearly reflected in the results. The NYSESLAT  results reflect the same pattern.  Most of the students scored at the expanding and commanding levels but reading and writing  were below the required level. For the NYSITELL however, while the pattern show there was a tendency for students to score  higher in the listening and speaking than in the reading and writing, 10 of the 40 newcomers or 25 % scored at or above  Expanding Proficiency level.        7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   We meet in grade teams during Common Planning meetings sessions as well as meeting with co-teachers  of Integrated  classrooms. Occasionally we meet to discuss wide data which include data about special population like English Language  Learners.         Part IV: ELL Programming    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.           ENL teachers collaborate with content teachers to make way for alignment and continuity.  Common planning in  collaboration with the classroom teachers during the grade-level common planning periods allows the ENL teachers  to work in synchronization with the scope and sequence of curriculum maps. In the integrated classroom, the ENL  teacher address the four language strands of language development - listening, speaking, reading, and writing and  provides the students with assistance in the content area subjects.  Appropriate ENL instructional strategies such as  scaffolding, building vocabulary, using webs and graphic organizers and charts, are utilized to facilitate learning. Use  of dictionaries and glossaries, and the "buddy system" are employed in this program.  We give assistance with  culturally unique words, sentence frames and evaluate their language and culture when needed.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A    c.  DL program.  If applicable.       Our Dual Language is currently confined to  Kindergarten and Grade 1 where students are learning literacy skills  through the content area and Spanish.  Dual Language students are taught by Mr. M. Figuero in Kindergarten and  by  Ms. A. Ufret in Grade 1 .  Dual Language students are immersed in the target language using the side-by-side model  and English is done in the other half.      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              According to the CR Part 154, students in bilingual and freestanding ENL programs must receive a certain number of  units of study weekly.  We ensure that all students meet the mandated ENL service requirements.  In Grades K – 5 Entering  Proficiency students and Emerging Proficiency students each receive 2 units of study weekly (360 min). Transitioning students  and Expanding Proficiency students are given 1 unit of study weekly (180 min).  Commanding Proficiency  students receive .5  unit (90 min) of study per week in Integrated ELA or Content Area or other approved services.  Commanding students will also  receive an additional two years of service.  This information is uploaded in STARS and any errors are highlighted and  corrected.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      At Jackie Robinson School, content area is an integral part of English Language delivery.  In our ENL program, we adopt an  interdisciplinary approach to language development through differentiated instruction within the content areas. Our approach  targets content-subject area specific vocabulary and content to our linguistically diverse learners. Additionally, dictionaries and  multilingual glossaries, multicultural books, as well as grade level books in the students' home languages, are a part of  classroom libraries. The ENL teacher utilizes instructional technology such as iPads, laptops, and websites, like  www.starfall.com and ww.colorincolorado.org. Also employed are the use of high quality classroom libraries that reflect  student diversity. We are fortunate to have several multilingual teachers and teaching assistants on faculty. We consistently  rely on their valuable expertise in exposing students to language and culture. As stated earlier, during pull-out periods, the ENL  teachers support students with the language necessary to understand the  concepts taught. Instructional strategies such as  scaffolding are used to develop students’ language and comprehension of content development. Teachers use various types of  scaffolding methods, such as modeling, bridging, contextualization, schema building, text re-presentation and meta-cognition,  to help students build English language skills. Classrooms are equipped with smart board technology to assist in instruction.  Listening centers and computer work stations are also employed to support content area as well as language acquisition.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55               During ENL instruction we  provide grade and age-level appropriate instruction designed to develop skills in listening,  speaking, reading, writing and communicating in English in the required content area subjects in English supported by English  as a second language methodologies, employed in a systematic and structured way, designed to develop the cognitive skills of  LEP ELLS. We integrate English as a New Language instruction with subject matter instruction. The technique focuses not only  on learning a second language, but using that language as a medium to learn mathematics, science, social studies, or other  academic subjects. The instructional activities in ENL classroom utilize students' real-life experiences, cultural experiences,  prior knowledge and offer situations in which students can interact with the teacher and fellow students. For lessons that  teach new concepts we use graphics, manipulatives, graphic organizers and other hands-on, concrete materials that clarify and  reinforce meanings communicated through language. We also do role play and use movement to engage students and instill  concepts.         The Dual language education program integrates native English speaking students with native Spanish speaking students  for academic instruction, which is presented in both languages. Social and academic learning occurs in an environment that  values the language and culture of all students and sets high standards to ultimately achieve academic success in Spanish and  English. Students learn the language through content based instruction. Two teachers each share the Dual Language class, one  delivering instruction in English 50 % of the day and the other in Spanish for the other 50 % of the day.  To facilitate the  acquisition of the target language students are given multiple opportunities to talk and to write during  their instruction.  Anchor charts in the target language and in English assist with comprehension and the modeling of  instruction allows students to negotiate meaning and make connections between content and prior Knowledge.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      All students are evaluated according to language provided in Home Language Survey. If there is not a staff on hand to  evaluate the student in native language, a request is made an appropriate support personnel  so a native language evaluator is  obtained and provided to conduct evaluation.  A student's native language will most likely have a strong influence on the way  that student learns English. Helping them to understand how their native language is similar to or different from English will  help. For example, teaching native Spanish speaking ELLS cognate awareness accelerates their English language vocabulary  development and helps them to understand words in English. The value of using a child's native language in instruction to  increase comprehensibility has been espoused in the theories of Cummins and Krashen. Utilizing the assistance of their more  fluent peers can be integral in helping beginners to acquire the target language.          Bilingual books, dictionaries and glossaries are provided to support content subjects. One of the ways that help ELLS to  recognize the value of their native language is the dissemination of notices and letters in their native language. Furthermore,  parents are encouraged to help their children continue to develop their native language at home, so that it is not lost in the  process of learning English. One formal way in which Speaking speaking ELLS are evaluated is through the Spanish Lab which is  given to all new entrants who became eligible via the NYSITELL. In addition, students who are unable to understand the Math,  and Science State tests in English may take versions translated into languages like Haitian Creole or Spanish. When tests are  not available in a student's native language, the test may be translated orally to the student either by a member of our  multilingual Spanish speaking staff or by an outside vendor..         5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Currently we have three students with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE). We exposed SIFE students to a rigorous ENL  program. This program focuses on developing Listening and Speaking competencies, while developing literacy and numeracy  skills.  A strong emphasis is placed on phonemic awareness and phonics, explicit vocabulary instruction and practice, content- area reading for fluency and comprehension, writing and ongoing assessment. In addition, we will integrate their areas of  interest, cultural and historical materials to develop the critical knowledge they need. Instruction in the basic skills they need  will be done, including how to study and participate in discussions. Access to support services will be provided by teacher  mentors, guidance counsellor and peers. Intensive literacy and language instruction will be given supported by inclusion in RTI   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      and after-school programs.  b.     The objective of instruction for newcomers is to develop students’ English language skills, help newcomers acculturate to  U.S. schools, and make them aware of educational expectations and opportunities. Newcomers are exposed to an intensive  English language development program emphasizing the development of Basic Intercommunication Skills (BICS) for eight  periods of ENL weekly. Although instruction uses the four language strands, namely listening, speaking, reading, and writing,  the delivery of instruction for this particular subgroup focuses more on developing their listening and speaking abilities.   c.     As per the NYSESLAT modality report which delineates a deficiency in reading and writing skills, ELLS receiving ENL  services for 4-6 years will be exposed to a rigorous English language development program that emphasizes the Cognitive  Academic Language Proficiency (CALP) in reading and writing.  Data is also used to drive and individualize instruction. Teachers  use this information to group students accordingly and develop challenging assignments based on students' needs and  abilities.  d.     The primary focus with Long-term ELLS is to provide support with the writing and reading skills.  Our long Termed Ells who  have demonstrated a lack of progress will participate in our targeted instruction during RTI and other small group instruction.  Effective instruction for them will involve integrated learning of concepts and language through meaningful  experiences.  Teachers and peers will scaffold instruction in both the spoken and written language so that students are able to  construe meaning.  e.      Former ELLS are mandated to receive up to two years of service following the year they exit from ELL status.  They  continue to receive transitional support by being grouped and pulled out with students who are at the Commanding  proficiency level on the NYSESLAT. This transitional support will help ease their transition into mainstream  classes.  Instructional activities in this case will focus on enhancing their writing skills by engaging them in creative writing  projects and publishing finished products. Additionally, former ELLS would benefit from extended time testing  accommodations just as current ELLS do.            All ELL subgroups will be entitled to testing accommodations such as time extension, separate location, bilingual  dictionaries, glossaries, oral translations and simultaneous use of English and alternative language editions when appropriate.        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?           ELL-SWDS are given the opportunity and the necessary support to meet rigorous academic standards by providing them  with strategic types of scaffolding, such as graphic organizers, visual aids, peer help, or home language help, and by removing  these supports as students’ skills develop.  Relevant background knowledge about a topic to be discussed in class can be  tapped into by activating their existing knowledge of a topic. ELLS are provided with ample opportunities to have extended  interaction (such as doing ‘jigsaw’-type activities) with peers of varying English proficiency levels, who can provide them with a  range of models for using English words or structures appropriately.  The teacher caters to different learning styles, so that  students can demonstrate knowledge through multiple means. Applying Universal Design to curricula and text materials  minimize barriers and maximize learning through flexibility.  Students use texts such as Supporting the Standards, Finish Line  for ELLS as well as computer programs like Starfall and Reading Plus.  SWDS who are mandated to receive bilingual instruction  but there is no service provider or placement available. After the School based Team meets, they assign an alternate language  teaching assistant whose language is the same as the student's.  This is done to support the classroom teacher and address the  educational needs of the student.           7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?           Flexible scheduling at PS 375 helps break away from the traditional 40-50-minute class periods. It increases the  instructional time spent on each subject. The model of flexible scheduling used for ELLS at Jackie Robinson School is that of a  pull-out program. Within the pull-out program the ENL instructor provides a more intensified academic instruction which also  assists the students with the acceleration of language development. ENL students succeed in activity-centered classes because  of two main factors: 1) students have regular opportunities for extended discourse; and 2) students take risks as they use the  target language in situations of personal choice to provide a rich, engaging educational experience. Longer instructional blocks  can also often positively impact school climate. Because there may be fewer class changes, there are fewer disciplinary  referrals. When the block schedule includes fewer classes each day, it often reduces stress for both student time to participate   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      in co-curricular activities that apply content-area learning such as  service learning opportunities, and student-led conferences.  Extended time in content areas provides for more in-depth study of topics and more hands-on activities. The teacher is able to  provide more varied instruction during class. Thus, it is easier to deal with students with disabilities and differing learning  styles but also there is now more time available to devote to non-disabled students.          ELL-SWDs who are placed in ICT classes are determined by student data needs considerations.  An individual student with  a disability must be made on an individual basis. For those students placed in an ITC class, integrated co-teaching is an  alternative to placement in a special education class. It has the added benefit of having both a special education and a general  education teacher deliver the curriculum to students in a less restrictive environment.  We consider the following factors when  placing ELL-SWDs in ITC classes:   1.     the classes in which integrated co-teaching is offered and the match to the student’s needs;  2.     the extent of special education services the individual student needs to access, participate and progress                 in the  general education curriculum;  3.     the similarity of needs of the other students with disabilities in the class;  4.     the potential effect of the class size on the students' learning needs;  5.     any potential benefits and harmful effects such services might have for the student or on the quality of                services  that he or she needs.        8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Entering and Emerging (34 students) students require 360 minutes of ENL instruction while Transitioning and Expanding  students (59 students) require 180 minutes of ENL services  weekly.   Commanding students ( 8 students) will be given 90  minutes  of  Integrated ENL.  Our ELL Coordinator Ms. A. Ufret  provides pull-out services as well as Integrated instruction in  Grades K-2, and Ms. A Lavalas  is the provider for Grades 3-5.  Interventions in ELA are done through RtI and Reading Plus. growth at the student's class, building and district levels.  Native  language teachers and and teaching assistants are involved to assist when difficulties arise because of language  barriers.  Interventions in ELA are done through RTI.  RTI is a program based on strong language and literacy instruction. It is  designed to meet the needs of struggling readers. Our RTI Literacy Clinic runs in three cycles:  1) Beginning of the Year - September to November  2) Middle of the Year, December – February                                                                                                                             End Of Year -  March to May  The RTI Team works with administration to monitor progress of Tier 2 and Tier 3 students every 2-3 weeks using DIBELS and  Tier 1 students 3 times  per year, using Fountas & Pinnel Reading Assessment, If students are not making adequate progress,  the team meets to address issues and discuss next steps. We do not have formal intervention programs for use with students  in Math, Science or Social Studies but there are some common informal interventions we have adopted across these content  area subjects with the goal of accelerating learning so that students will reach grade level. The interventions are:  • Demonstrate that vocabulary can have multiple meanings. Help students understand the different meanings of words as well  as how to use them correctly in context.  • Encourage students to offer bilingual support to each other. Students will understand material better if they explain it to  another student, and the new student will benefit from hearing the explanation in his/her first language.  • Provide visual cues, graphic representations, gestures, realia, and pictures.  Offer students the chance to work with objects  and images in order to master academic vocabulary.   • Identify key phrases or new vocabulary to pre-teach.  • Modify the linguistic complexity of language and rephrase problems. Students will understand the problem better if it is  stated in shorter sentences and in language they understand.  • Guide students to cross out the unnecessary vocabulary in word problems.  Build knowledge from real world examples and  reinforce concepts with examples that students can picture and talk students through the situation.   • Use manipulatives purposefully.   •  Spatial organizers help students understand and remember information by teaching them to sort concepts, facts, and ideas  using charts, diagrams, graphs, or other graphic organizers.

Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      At the beginning of the 2015-2016 school year, Dual Language programs in Pre-Kindergarten and Kindergarten were opened. It  is the vision of school leadership that with each succeeding year that program will continue expanding grade by grade until PS  375 can offer a DL program on each grade level from Grades K-5.  Best practice and research dictate that both English and the  child’s home language should be actively supported to facilitate language and literacy development during the crucial early  years. Early childhood students need to be fluent in English, but not at the expense of losing their first languages.   In a Dual  Language classroom, all English language learners receive systematic support for home and English language acquisition in  their natural school environment. In addition, there has been an increasing number of Spanish speaking students entering  early childhood classrooms so a Dual Language program can help administrators to provide supports that make it possible for  classroom teachers to meet the needs of parents who request this service for their children and for others who may may want  their children to learn another language.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A          11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  English Language Learners are not only given equal access to all school programs, but because they are targeted as a subgroup  in need of more instructional intervention, they receive intensive small group instruction. ELLs are allowed to participate in  after school programs to further address their needs.   Assigned sessions of THRIVE Academy After School, held from 2.30  p.m.to 4.30 p.m Wednesdays and Thursdays, are instructional periods that enable students to enhance, enrich, and extend  literacy. During Saturday Academy, ELLs further develop content knowledge centered around specific themes/topics.  Students  get involved in projects that require them to share ideas and work in various learning settings. They read to promote schema  around specific topics, and use independent leveled reading materials, such as trade books and novels to meet their needs.  As  students acquire more literacy strategies, the text materials become increasingly difficult.  They are also included in other  programs that are conducted in the school.  Among these are Girls’ Inc. where girls in grades 3-5 meet weekly with  professionally trained Girls Inc. facilitators for 45 minutes.  The programs are designed to empower girls with the skills, tools  and the self-confidence they need to become leaders in their communities.   CookShop, the core nutrition education program  of the Food Bank For New York City, gives low-income children  the knowledge and tools to adopt and enjoy a healthy diet and  active lifestyle on a limited budget.  In CookShop students learn about nutrition and physical activity, as well as acquiring  cooking skills.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.   Classrooms have smartboard technology, iPads, and computers. The ESL classroom has a library which contains multicultural  books and small selections of books in students' native language. The selection of the library books and the services provided  at Jackie Robinson are based on the students' needs, and are age and grade-level appropriate. Fountas and Pinnell reading  level system is used to determine the appropriate independent reading level of each student. Books are arranged in baskets  according to their reading levels.  Based on the data in the NYSESLAT modality report, students who are deficient in Listening  and Speaking are engaged in listening centers using, books on tapes and computer-based activities. On the other hand,  students deficient in Reading and Writing are immersed in activities that enhance content-based vocabulary building, fluency,  and reading comprehension. Supplementary resources include hands-on manipulatives, and pictures.  The creation and implementation of a Title III Program serves to provide an additional supplementary resource to ensure that  ELLs are reaching proficiency level in English at a predictable pace. In our project Title III Program, THRIVE Academy, we  attempt to develop and strengthen literacy skills in both reading and writing for ELLS in grades K-5. We use shared reading,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      read alouds, close reading, guided reading and independent reading to improve fluency and reading comprehension. To  facilitate the writing process, the following strategies will be implemented: vocabulary building, modeling, graphic organizers,  journal writing.  The program operates three days weekly ( Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday) and runs from 3:00-5:00 p.m.  when in session.  We use Harcourt Science resources and science kits for science investigations and for Social Studies, we use Houghton  Mifflin Harcourt Social Studies resources. Instruction from these texts is scaffolded to support learners and facilitate the  construction of meaning and content. Not only does the teacher appeal to native language where appropriate but by using  their more proficient peers, students are able to meaningfully engage in content area learning.  THRIVE Academy  THRIVE Academy will include approximately 60-80 ELL students. Two highly qualified ENL teachers and two General Education  teachers will instruct the students. The student roster will not exceed the 20 students per teacher ratio. An administrator will  be available in the building supervising other after-school activities and will assist THRIVE Academy at no cost to the program.  Technology will be integrated to enhance the four language strands (Listening, Speaking, Reading, and Writing) through the  use of iPads and audio books, etc. Other comprehensive assessment tools in reading and writing such as myOn will be utilized  to provide teachers with a valuable over-all view of a student’s progress.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   We use the students' home language to help in building oral language development in their first language and to develop and  enhance their cognitive skills as they are acquiring the target language English.  Jackie Robinson P.S. 375 prides itself for  its  multilingual staff members.  The ENL teacher ensures that not only translation of the State Math and Science is made  available to students for whom a translated version of the test is not available, but also uses the students’ first language to  support content area comprehension.  In cases where the homeroom teacher is not proficient in the student’s first language,  newcomers are paired with other advanced ELLs who are fluent in both languages.  Furthermore, classroom libraries are  infused with books and audio books in different languages.  A native language support teaching assistant works with the  Entering ELLs in grades K, 2 and 5 to assist with content area instruction, concentrating in Math and Science.  In addition,  native language exams are primarily used with our ELLs who have been in the United States for 2 years or less. The option is  given after the second year to continue the use of translated tests. We find that after 2 years in school, the student’s  knowledge of their home language has diminished and they are more proficient in English. We also provide bilingual glossaries  in Social Studies, Math and Science for our ELL students to use within the content area class as well as during assessments.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Intensive guidance and support services are provided to assist students who are experiencing affective-domain issues that are  impacting on their ability to achieve academically.  Although the intensity of the services vary, all Grade 3-5 students  performing at Levels 1 and 2 and Early Childhood students deemed to be at risk, will receive appropriately targeted services.  Additionally, to facilitate understanding of content area subjects,  glossaries, bilingual dictionaries, and multilingual libraries  are purchased and made available to Newcomers and students taking the NYS Standardized tests in their native languages.   For ELL-SWDs, we adapt content, methodology, and delivery of instruction to address their unique needs and to ensure access  to the general curriculum so that they can meet the core standards targeted for their ages and grades.  Conferring with the  special education teacher is important so the IEP goals are met.  Powerful supports like adapted materials—such as books on  tape, large print, or highlighted notes, and use of technology are available to children with disabilities.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?     Classrooms have smartboard technology, iPads, and computers. The ESL classroom has a library which contains multicultural  books and small selections of books in students' native language. The selection of the library books and the services provided  at Jackie Robinson are based on the students' needs, and are age and grade-level appropriate.

Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Newly enrolled ELLS are given teacher information, classroom location, basic information about the school's attendance policy,  bussing information, lunch information and general information about American culture.  This is usually disemminated at a  parent workshop held in the month of July.   The Principal Mrs. Ellman and the parent coodinator  Ms. Graham are  involved.  The Ells Coordinator Ms. Oxley reinforces this information at orientation and on Parent Night and further questions  are addressed.  Parents are encouraged to read with their children in their native language to help them develop reasoning  skills through their native language. Participating parents are encouraged to join the library will be assisted in securing a library  card.  They are advised that students who read in their native language perform better in school, are more likely to be  competent readers, and transfer the ability to read well in the native language to English.  Parents are reminded that they are their children’s first teachers and they have an obligation to encourage their children to  read to increase their children’s chances of succeeding in school.  They are also further encouraged to attend  meetings for  ELLS , join the Parent Teachers Association and read all information that comes home as well as to volunteer at school events  and in the classroom.  Parents and students are taken on a tour of the school to give some familiarity with the building.        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    N/A       18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   A. For our Dual Language program we have adopted the side by side model with English Proficient and  ELLS integration for 100% of the day.   B. Core content is taught in English supported by Spanish.   C. All students learn to read in both languages simultaneously. Skills taught in each language are  coordinated to maximize cross- linguistic transfer and support learning in content areas.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61         D. Both languages will be taught simultaneously so connections between languages could be made but  the overall goal is for students is to master English language.      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?   Mondays are designated contractually as Professional Development day for teachers. Our professional development program  is rooted in the belief that all teachers are teachers of Language Arts and that English as a New Language is a natural and  humanistic extension of English Language Arts. With this in mind, we will design a professional development program that will  prepare all teachers to better serve the linguistically diverse population at Jackie Robinson Public School 375. This will be  accomplished by the following:   All teachers who serve ELLs will be encouraged to attend Local Support Organizations ELL professional development. These  sessions will focus on professional practice and methodologies that use ENL strategies to strengthen content area instruction  across the curricula.   The two ELL Teachers will turnkey information and provide on-going professional development in  strategies techniques for  working with ELLs during in-school common planning periods.     November 2015        Strandards that Impact English Language Learners  December 2015        Culturally Responsive Instruction for ELLs  January 2016           Teaching ELLs to NavigateToos of Vocabulary Instruction.     Other sessions will include discussions in a study group setting where non-ENL teachers will be better informed about how  ELLs learn and how to adapt instruction to maintain rigor and provide support.  All of our ENL teachers meet with classroom  teachers where possible during common preps for articulation and planning. During these meetings, techniques and strategies  are shared with teachers to assist them in supporting their ELLS during content area instruction within the  classroom.  Additionally, both classroom and ENL teachers will participate in professional development aimed at supporting  our English Language Learners.      To help make certain that English Language Learners attain English proficiency and achieve academically, all staff members  who hold an ENL or bilingual license will be encouraged to attend an ongoing series of Professional Development towards  completing 7.5 hours in ENL methodology as per Jose P. Jose Mandate.  These training sessions will be will be conducted by on- staff ENL teachers and built into the regular staff development schedule, during professional development days, and at grade- wide meetings including weekly Common Planning sessions and Lunch and Learn sessions,  professional development days,  and grade meetings, faculty conferences, learning walks and wrap ups following learning walks. These on-site professional  development sessions will be dedicated to ENL methodologies, awareness and sensitivity and other pedagogical techniques  that use ENL strategies to strengthen content area instruction across the curricula. For all staff members and stakeholders like  paraprofessionals, guidance counselors, special education teachers, psychologists, occupational/physical therapists, speech  therapists will be offered professional development  by the Instructional Core Team.  The professional development will be  based on teaches' surveys and needs of ELLs observed during instruction.    The Parent Cordinator will be invited to workshops put on by NYC Department of Education, Division of English Language  Learners and Student Support. Special education teachers will receive three (3) additional Professional Developments sessions.  Secretaries will be given training in imputting ENL related information and will be encouraged to attend a Secretary training  when it is put on by the Division of English Language Learners and Student Support.       Professional development is offered school wide to all teachers to succeed with the diverse population in our  school.  Teachers will complete a survey that asks for them to indicate their areas of needs ranging from behavior  management, infusion of technology, effective strategies working with SWD and ELLs, designing coherent instruction, effective  questioning and discussion techniques, engaging students in learning, Universal Design for Learning, Depth of Knowledge,  connecting real world experiences to enhance students learning, and curriculum development.

Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.   The Guidance Counselor Mr. Matthew attends the yearly Admission Process Training which informs and updates the middle  application process. The guidance department provides a workshop for parents of graduating students, inclusive of ELLs  parents, concerning completion of the middle school selection process, transitioning of records to new school, and available  resources to assist parents in helping their children to experience a less stressful transition.  Middle school directories in  different languages are given out. There are translators present to cater to the translation needs of parents.  In-school  classroom visits are made to prep students by helping them to form realistic expectations of what middle school will be like,  providing positive messages that middle school is safe and fun, and they are informed about the choices, opportunities and  responsibilities that await them in middle school thereby helping to ensure a successful introduction to the middle school  experience.   To help ensure that English Language Learners and immigrant students attain English proficiency and achieve academically, all  staff members who hold a license other than ENL or bilingual license will be encouraged to attend an ongoing series of  Professional Development towards completing 7.5 hours in ENL methodology as per Jose P. Jose Mandate. These training  sessions will be built into the regular staff development schedule and will be conducted by on-staff ENL teachers. Other  training opportunities by the DOE will also be made available. All teachers attending the training will become culturally aware  and linguistically sensitive to the unique needs of their ELL students and will approach teaching and learning using pedagogical  techniques and methodologies proven effective with ELLs such as Total Physical Response, the Language Experience Approach,  rebus, rhymes, patterning. Records of teacher attendance at out-of-town trainings will be maintained by the school secretary.  The ENL  coordinator will also keep records of training (Notes and attendance).       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   PS 375 has an open door policy for its parents.  Any parent can come and make a request to meet with any teacher or service  provider about the concerns that they have.   Meetings are called to in response to calls from parents or teachers,  for parent  contact time, IEP meetings, or for individual or group purposes.  The more parents have the opportunity to participate, shape  activities and programs that help their families, the more vested they will be in seeing those efforts succeed. In arranging a  meeting, letters are sent home  inviting parents to the meeting.  The purpose of the conference and the time is included.  An  agenda may be added too.  At the meeting the goals for the conference are explained.  Sometimes we discuss the child 's  language development, progress in each academic area, standardized test scores, goals for the child, and strategies to meet  goals.  Samples of child’s student work is sometimes  produced to support the discussion. Parents are allowed to ask questions  and or discuss their issues. We provide interpreters from among the cadre of our multilingual staff members or in cases where  there is no one who speaks a required language, we turn to the DOE Translation and Interpretation service.       2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Fostering diversity and cultural respect is an important focus at the school. We celebrate cultural heritage within the school  year with special assemblies arranged by our Arts department.  Parents assist in providing costumes, food, and other cultural  representations. During Respect for All Week, our School Based Support Team visit each class and talk about diversity and  respecting the cultural differences within society.  Parents are welcomed to participate in speaking to the class about their  culture. In 2014-2015, 3 out 5 Learning Leaders were of Spanish heritage. We hope to have more parents involved in the  program in the coming school year. We host dads who bring their children to school on on the day set aside for that event.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63         Currently the school partners with Medgar Evers College to provide GED and English Learning classes for parents of ELLS. The  Parent Coordinator distributes the information, encourages the parents to take part and collects the forms of  applicants.  Parents also take part in our Career Day activities either by attending or telling about their careers. The Parent  Coordinator distributes invitations and meets and greets parents.     Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.

Data of parents language preference is collected from the HLIS form, the students emergency contact forms, the  RHLA and RALP reports in ATS, and surveys conducted by the school so the school to ensure information is up to  date. School personnel such as the parent coordinator, teacher, or ELL Coordinator may also identify a LEP parent  in face-to-face conversations. Some parents may also self-identify as LEP. Parents language preference forms will  be updated periodically so that there is no breach in the communication lines with parents.           2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community.

If there is an emergency in the school, contact information relating to the school's student population can be  retrieved from the blue cards, class lists, the ROCL and from teachers updated records. Emergency messages can be  sent out via text messages in the students home language, email where available, telephone calls, voice with  instructions and the School Messenger electronic notification system will offer language options(If the emergency is  school-wide).             Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      To ensure that everyone in our school community is aware of their obligations with respect to language access and  how to assist LEP parents, teachers and teaching assistants will be trained by the Language Access Coordinator Ms. J.  Oxley in a professional development session. Simulations will ensure that content is understood. Parent coordinators  and other key school-based-staff will be trained by the Translation and Interpretation Unit.           Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)

We have also begun to conduct simultaneous meetings in other languages. PS 375  staff will also access the Translation and Interpretation Unit services whenever we are unable to provide our own  translators at any event. We are cognizant of the need to have a speaker of the primary language of the parent at  every IEP meeting and other important meetings, and we do provide this service. Every parent who has indicated a  primary language other than English has and will continue to receive a copy of the Bill of Parents Rights and  Responsibilities in their primary languages. The school's Safety Plan and LAP provides for this Translation and  Interpretation Service. Our Parent Coordinator makes an effort to contact every parents on an ongoing basis notifying  them in their preferred languages of ongoing activities, services, meetings, and workshops. Our main lobby has  signage in multiple languages - A multilingual welcome poster and a Language Identification poster for identifying  parent’s primary language are visibly posted at the entrance in the main lobby of our school.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       At P.S.375 parent feedback is important as it provides us with vital information on how we can assist them and their  children better. Our Parent Coordinator is the main point of parental contact. Parents complete a parent intake form  when they have any concerns or request. The scheduled parent -teacher conferences also are avenues that the school  obtain parent feedback. Monthly PTA meetings benefit the schools as parents' comments and concerns are noted  from the meetings. Feedback is sometimes obtained at SLT meetings or at informal settings such as our annual Thrive  Academy dinner. We have an open door policy here at PS 375 and expect our parents to fully utilize it. Out of surveys  conducted with parents we have been able to provide professional development to meet the needs of parents. We  have been also able to involve parents in a program with Medgar Evers College where they are able to learn English.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74
