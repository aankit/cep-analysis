The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7     In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           8       NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           10      Section 4: SCEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   At Lucero Elementary School, our vision is to develop individuals that are active participants in the social, economic,  and political systems of our world and who apply what they have learned to care for the world in which they live and  find solutions to the challenges of the twenty-first century.   Our mission is to cultivate 21st century, college-bound learners who embark on gaining a rich understanding about  the issues impacting the local and global communities of which they are a part and who become equipped with the  academic, inter-personal, and technological skills necessary for growing into participatory citizens who generate  solutions for a better world. At Lucero Elementary School, students will become the Einsteins of social ideas and  solutions. When one of our students shines brightly, so does the world.   OUR LUCERO “PEACE” VALUES are the foundation that drives every aspect of our activities:   ● Perseverance: We tirelessly pursue our goals, especially when the work gets tough.   ● Enthusiasm for Learning: We make our learning joyful and worthwhile by being mentally and physically industrious  every day.   ● Activism for Social Justice: We are aware citizens who care about our local and global communities and take action  to make the world shine brightly.   ● Collaboration: We work productively, attentively, and respectfully to achieve the best results for the whole team.   ● Empathy: We care about others by placing ourselves in their shoes to better understand their feelings, thoughts,  and experiences.                            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Research-based planned instructional practices promote rigorous, sustainable, and engaging quality classroom  interactions to ensure that we achieve our over-arching school mission. To set the tone for how our school will  continue to approach instruction and learning, professional development focusing on our school’s mission, vision,  core values, essential intellectual skills, and character traits to be developed is provided in the first week of our  summer planning institute. Teachers learn to understand how each of the aforementioned components inter-relate  with one another on a daily basis to ensure that we achieve the mission of our school. Teachers are provided with and  trained on how to implement the Common Core aligned curriculum units of study across all subject areas.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           11      Following is a table of the current demographic breakdown of students at Lucero Elementary School (last snapshot  taken October 2017):   School Level   elementary 378 100%            213 56.35%  165 43.65%        0.26%  0.26%  0%   348 92.06%  1  1  0  26  6.88%  0.53%  2  0  0%  0%  0       173 45.77%   84  22.22%   Gender  Male  Female  Ethnicity  Hispanic  American Indian or Alaskan Native  Asian  Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander  Black  White  Multi-racial  Not Reported  English Language Learners (ELL)  ELL  Special Education  (Total students with IEPs excluding PreK)  Percent of students with IEPs at this school who:  receive Related Services only  spend less than 20% of the week receiving Special Education classroom services  spend between 21 and 59% of the week receiving Special Education classroom services 2  spend >60% of their week in Integrated Co-Teaching (ICT) classes  received Self-Contained services >60% of the week  records in progress    Data as of July 23, 2018, provided by ATS and refreshed mid-month.                9.52%   8  28  33.33%   2.38%   27  32.14%  19  22.62%  0   0%   3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   The majority of our students are Hispanic, English Language Learners. Due to this demographic and the overwhelming  demand of the community for bilingual services, Lucero offers Dual Language programming that gives the opportunity  for our students to preserve and celebrate their own culture, while learning the new second language and culture.      Teachers in the Dual Language program will follow the same instructional plan as the general education section of the  school. They use sheltered instruction approaches to serve ELLs in the program and differentiate for all learners as  gleaned from assessment data.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           12         In the Grade K Dual Language classrooms, instruction is offered through the 80/20 model. In Grade K instruction is  provided in the following manner: Literacy and Mathematics instruction in Spanish (80%) and Science and Social  Studies in English (20%) so that we can “front-load” the Spanish language to ensure greater success in the program as  they move along year to year.      In Grade 1-5 Dual Language classrooms, instruction is offered through the 50/50 model. The classes in Grade 1, 2, 3,  and 5 are side by side models. The classes in grades K and 4 are self-contained model (due to the K 80/20 model and  physical space and no counterpart classroom in Grade 4). Grade K-5 teachers provide all content areas in both English  and Spanish. Every day, the classes will learn in both English and Spanish so that they receive 100% of their literacy  time in both languages throughout the year. They will switch language of instruction and receive continued  instruction in all subject areas in the opposite language. Thus, students will receive 50/50 in both English and Native  Language Arts. In Grade 1, 3 and 5, one Dual Language classroom on each grade will also have a Dual Language ICT  class to support students with IEPs.      Students are assessed in both languages across all subject areas. Teaching points are identified by teacher teams for  each lesson delivered across the subject areas. Teachers create assessment spreadsheets to go along with each lesson  to compare what students should be able to do by the end of the lesson with what they actually are able to do after a  lesson. For example, for a lesson that focuses on how to reference poetry in order to locate answers to questions that  evidence thinking, teachers might identify the following assessment checkpoints:   · Student is able to refer use stanza and line when referencing the text.   · Student is able to evidence their thinking with accuracy.      Thus, teachers across the grade are able to monitor for the same skills and use this data to refine instructional  practices and the curriculum unit plans. ELA and NLA standards are used to identify teaching points (objectives) and to  develop assessment checkpoints.         Teachers use the Fountas and Pinnell and iReady reading assessments to assess reading fluency and comprehension in  both English and Spanish. Each kit provides teachers with tools to identify the independent and guided reading level  of each student. Data gleaned through the assessment helps teachers to identify a focus for instruction. This  assessment is used 3 times per year as a diagnostic, formative, and summative assessment of reading.      Performance tasks at the beginning and end of each unit, and completion of literacy and math units help teachers to  determine growth in specific units and targeted standards. Rubrics help to identify learning targets, so that growth  may be ascertained.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           13         In addition, students are informed of the data collected and are taught how to self-assess and set goals. They assess  themselves on rubrics and reflect upon the attainment of goals.         Teachers meet in teams once per week to review the data gleaned through daily formative assessments (e.g. writing,  publishing pieces, observations, assessment checkpoints) and periodic assessments. Teachers use protocols to ensure  a structured approach towards reviewing data. They use information gleaned through the review to make revisions to  units of study, lessons, or to differentiate parts of lessons to meet the needs of specific students.      All units of study are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS). Units of study evidence planning to  address the needs of ELLs and the English dominant students in the Dual Language program. Rubrics use the CCLS as a  tool for development, as it allows teachers to accurately align instruction to the standards. In addition, the Tri-State  Rubric for Quality Instruction in Literacy and Math units of study (supported by Engage NY) help teachers to identify  tangible characteristics that ensure rigor in lesson planning. The Tri-State rubric addresses 4 dimensions in lesson and  unit planning including: 1) Alignment to the Rigor of the CCLS, 2) Key Areas of Focus in the CCLS, 3) Instructional  Supports, and 4) Assessment. The rubric offers teachers a common language in regards to defining rigor in a concrete  manner.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The elements of the Framework for Great Schools that we made the most progress in and demonstrated success over  the previous school year (2017-18) include the following:   Rigorous Instruction: We have made the most progress in providing students with rigorous instruction on our 2016- 17 Quality Review, compared to the 2014-15 Quality Review.       Findings  Across classrooms teaching practices are aligned to the curricula and beliefs reflected in classrooms. Teaching  strategies provide multiple entry points into learning.      Impact  The instructional shifts and use of Danielson’s Framework for Teaching inform teaching practices so that all students  are engaged in challenging tasks.       Supporting Evidence  -Staff believes that students learn best when learning is authentic and provides opportunities for creative and critical  thinking. The Instructional focus is inquiry learning in math, workshop model, providing authentic reading and writing       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           14      experiences, close reading strategies, guided reading, and implementing the Math Congress. In most classroom visits,  teachers were adhering to the structure of the workshops, conducting mini-lesson, modeling, guided, independent  practices and the share component was observed. For example, in fourth grade class, students were reading closely  and using text structure to determine how the author structured the informational text. Students were engaged in a  mini-lesson on the rug and discussed aspects of the text as a group and then with a partner. In another grade five  math class, the investigation by students centered on an inquiry word problem connected to baking a strawberry  shortcake. Students worked in groups and used close reading to highlight key details in the problem.      -As a Dual Language Bilingual School that serves over fifty-four percent English Language Learners, teachers and  school leader shared the need to ensure tiered task are created to provide entry points for students. The  Differentiation Menu is created for units and drives the plans for activities that vary content, process, and product. In  a third-grade dual language classroom students were grouped by language levels and charged with locating details,  sentence complexity, punctuation and grammar related to a common text. A checklist was used to support students  in identifying how an author organizes text. Teachers use sentence starters, graphic organizers, level texts, varying  levels of Webb’s Depth of Knowledge (DOK) for questions, customized learning center activities, and language  supports provide entry points into learning. In math, the emphasis on visual representations and creating models  assists in building conceptual understanding. In a grade two math lesson students were solving real-life problems  using additional and subtraction. Students were working in groups with access to various strategies they could employ  to get entry into the problem.      -The implementation of Math Congress has allowed students to share their thinking and exposing other strategies to  students on how they could solve problems. In a fifth-grade lesson, students were working in five groups, talking  about options and approaches to solving the problem. The teacher calls the group back to the rug and selects a  student and displays the work for the class to see. The teacher probes the student about the approach used to begin  solving the problem, could objects or picture help, does the answer make sense and other questions to understand  the students’ thinking. Math games provide differentiated options for partnerships to explore and practice new  concepts. Across classrooms, students turned and talked relying on questions posed by the teacher. In a self- contained class the questions posed by the teacher did not advance dialogue among students. In most classrooms,  the discussion was managed by the teacher and occurred mostly with teacher support. Students worked in groups but  rarely sought support from peers. Questions posed by the teachers did not trigger discussion among students.  Lessons seen linked to real world applications with the options for sharing at end of lesson.      Supportive Environment : The school maintains a culture of mutual trust and positive attitudes that supports the  academic and personal growth of students and adults. (Evidenced by our rating of “Well-Developed” on Indicator 1.4  on the 2016-17 Quality Review)      Collaborative Teachers: The teachers engage in structured professional collaborations on teams using an inquiry  approach that promotes shared leadership and focuses on improved student learning.

Distributive leadership structures  allow teachers to be active in the school.      Impact  Protocols and action plans guide teachers’ work to further the goals of the schools and strengthened pedagogy  through the implementation of the Common Core Learning Standards including the instructional shifts. Teacher  leadership opportunities results in shared governance focused on improved student learning across the school.  Supporting Evidence  -Teachers meet weekly to look at student work and assessments in literacy, additional sessions are scheduled to go  deeper into ensuring pacing and lessons meet their diverse learners’ needs based on data. In math, teachers plan  inquiry-based lessons using Exemplars and Context for Learning resources with the goal of increasing student  engagement and planning for differentiation. Instructional coaches support teams in using data and provide individual  support to teachers. Teams maintain meeting documents inclusive of a focus, minutes, and next steps for follow up  and tracking assignments of team tasks. Teachers determine next steps for groups of students ranging from  performance far below to exceeding standards. For example, following the analysis of the opinion writing assessment,  teachers sorted data by levels indicating percentages and number of students assigned by levels. All teacher teams  continually select a few of the class work products to look closer at, noting specific evidence of students  understanding and documents their plans using Inquiry Cycle Action Plan.      -Staff shared that they appreciate the collaborative culture that exists and that staff has the opportunity to grow in  this environment. Grade leaders meet together weekly and focus their work on school wide initiatives, sharing,  communicating ideas and information back to their home teams. Teachers play active role in the school such as  coordinating the Community Circle activity weekly, leading the Wellness initiatives, Student Council, art, newsletters,  and other activities. Teachers lead and participate in instructional rounds in teams that have been arranged based on  problems of practice submitted by peers. Paraprofessionals are trained in a reading intervention technique provide  one to one tutoring for targeted students. Participation in hiring and development of selection criteria are aligned to  the PEACE values. The principal shared that “There is great value placed in this community on collaboration and  ownership.”      -During the teacher team observations, grade one teachers examined pre-and post-assessments to look for growth  and identify additional areas to work on. Teachers were using laptops to access student specific data and discussed  changes for the next unit based on the data and student work. The team suggested adding two other models with the  conclusion and having students talk about options for the ending. Teachers also shared successful strategies used with  colleagues and tools used that were helpful for English Language Learners. Teams follow a cycle for their work,  teachers shared the focus for grade one was close reading. Teams work together to identify learning outcomes which  are designed using student friendly format. The use of “I can” statements such as “I can use close reading ritual to  organize my thinking” or I can read for the gist of the text by note-taking loose words or short phrases.” Strategies are  shared to support students meeting the learning targets and possible options to differentiate lessons are documented  on the Differentiation Menu for the unit.    Effective School Leadership: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.

The teachers’ weekly newsletters are aligned to specific aspects of Danielson Framework for Teaching  that the community is focusing upon. For example, the purposeful use of charts as instructional footprints to support  content understanding are linked demonstrating knowledge of content and pedagogy. Expectations for classroom  management is highlighted under administrative section of the newsletters and all items are aligned to the Danielson  Framework for Teaching. The weekly news provides upcoming events, highlight of good practices and expectations  including effective use of charts, inquiry in mathematics, assessments, lesson planning and school culture. The  instructional focus is to support teachers implementing the workshop model and this area was revisited throughout  the year. Teachers attend a week of professional development in the summer to help them to begin the year with  clear methods to teach using the workshop model, support with group strategies, questioning and use of  mathematical practices. Teachers commented that the school leader partners with them to meet expectations by co- teaching lessons, modeling and engaging in open dialogue through teams, and observation feedback.      -Expectations for college and beyond are reinforced in the core values of Perseverance, Enthusiasm for learning,  Activism for social justice, Collaboration, and Empathy (PEACE). The PEACE values and mission is to cultivate college  bound learners equipped with academic, inter-personal and technological skills to participate in the global society.  The Community Circle brings all members of the school together to meet weekly and focus deeply on one of the core  values. Teachers communicate progress and recognition of growth toward core values to families through phone calls  and written comments shared in the Parent Communication Folders every Friday.         Strong Family-Community Ties: School leaders and staff consistently communicate high expectations with an  emphasis on the instructional focus and Danielson Framework for Teaching. The administrator and teachers  effectively communicate and partner with families communicating expectations and progress connected to college  readiness. (Evidenced by our rating of “Well-Developed” on Indicator 3.4 on the 2016-17 Quality Review)      -Partnership with parents results in ongoing communication regarding progress using a messaging system that allows  parents to interface with school personnel. Parents shared that teachers provide feedback to families and are always  available to support them. Teacher shared that welcoming families in for meetings, email, use of Tuesday time, and  phone calls are some ways they communicate. First grade teachers are piloting a new initiative whereby fifteen- minute time slots are scheduled to check in with families regarding the progress towards learning and using high  frequency words and movement towards attainment of reading goals. During the parent meeting, parents stated that  families are partners and twice a month they engage in learning walks. During these walks, parents visit classrooms,  see instructional strategies, and learn about the instructional shifts and Common Core Learning Standards. Parents  shared that regular communication occurs with staff, and on Fridays the Community Circle keeps them informed  about the expectations for learning and college and career readiness. During the Principal Choice, parents were  participating in an immigration session which was a result of recent questions and concerns among families that was  organized by school staff.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           17      Trust: The school community maintains a culture of mutual trust and positive attitudes that supports the academic  and personal growth of students and adults (Evidenced by our rating of “Well-Developed” on Indicator 1.4 the 2016- 17 Quality Review).         Although all six areas of the Framework for Great Schools will be addressed, our priority areas of focus, deriving from  the Framework for Great Schools (and through the 2016-17 Quality Review feedback), for year 2017-18 include the  following:   Rigorous Instruction: (though our school received a rating of Proficient, this was identified as the area of focus to  meet the highest tier--well0-developed--on the Quality Review rubric.

The principal and staff successfully partner with families to provide supports and a value system that  ensure progress for all students towards meeting those high expectations.   Area of Focus: Quality Indicator 1.2 Pedagogy    Rating: Proficient   Findings  Across classrooms teaching practices are aligned to the curricula and beliefs reflected in classrooms. Teaching strategies  provide multiple entry points into learning.      Impact  The instructional shifts and use of Danielson’s Framework for Teaching inform teaching practices so that all students are  engaged in challenging tasks. However, discussion and questioning among students did not reflect high-order thinking  skills and there was limited use of strategic scaffolding of curricula to ensure access by all learners.   Data from our DRA and Writing and Math Performance Tasks yields the following information:      PROFICIENCY LEVELS DATA (Newest data will be updated by June 30, 2017)            QUALITY REVIEW DATA   As evidenced by 2016-2017 Quality Review, our school’s strengths are developing units of study based on the Common  Core Learning Standards and are coherent across the grades using student work and data of individual and groups of  students including ELLs and SWD. The curriculum that is designed reflects instructional shifts.      In ELA:   ● Reading Units are balanced 50% informational and 50% fictional   ● All informational and opinion tasks are derived from sources    ● Sources that support student writing, and reading texts are selected for appropriate complexity. Text supports and  differentiated materials are planned where necessary.           2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           23      In Math:    ● Students are expected to have speed and accuracy with simple calculations   ● Students deeply understand concepts and move within a topic in several ways with success before moving on   ● Students are expected to use math and choose the appropriate concept for application independently.   ● Students are practicing and understanding concurrently.       Students need further work demonstrating independence. Teachers will reduce teacher-talk time and increase student- talk time through the use of reciprocal reading time, debate dates, math congress, and presentations.       In addition, the students need to have speed and accuracy when solving simple calculations in order to delve deeper  when problem solving. Using strategies to solve one and two-step word problems by showing and explaining their  mathematical thinking.

Supporting Evidence  -Staff believes that students learn best when learning is authentic and provides opportunities for creative and critical  thinking. The Instructional focus is inquiry learning in math, workshop model, providing authentic reading and writing  experiences, close reading strategies, guided reading, and implementing the Math Congress. In most classroom visits,  teachers were adhering to the structure of the workshops, conducting mini-lesson, modeling, guided, independent  practices and the share component was observed. For example, in fourth grade class, students were reading closely and  using text structure to determine how the author structured the informational text. Students were engaged in a mini- lesson on the rug and discussed aspects of the text as a group and then with a partner. In another grade five math class,  the investigation by students centered on an inquiry word problem connected to baking a strawberry shortcake.  Students worked in groups and used close reading to highlight key details in the problem.      -As a Dual Language Bilingual School that serves over fifty-four percent English Language Learners, teachers and school  leader shared the need to ensure tiered task are created to provide entry points for students. The Differentiation Menu  is created for units and drives the plans for activities that vary content, process, and product. In a third-grade dual  language classroom students were grouped by language levels and charged with locating details, sentence complexity,  punctuation and grammar related to a common text. A checklist was used to support students in identifying how an  author organizes text. Teachers use sentence starters, graphic organizers, level texts, varying levels of Webb’s Depth of  Knowledge (DOK) for questions, customized learning center activities, and language supports provide entry points into  learning. In math, the emphasis on visual representations and creating models assists in building conceptual  understanding. In a grade two math lesson students were solving real-life problems using additional and subtraction.  Students were working in groups with access to various strategies they could employ to get entry into the problem.      -The implementation of Math Congress has allowed students to share their thinking and exposing other strategies to  students on how they could solve problems. In a fifth-grade lesson, students were working in five groups, talking about  options and approaches to solving the problem. The teacher calls the group back to the rug and selects a student and  displays the work for the class to see. The teacher probes the student about the approach used to begin solving the  problem, could objects or picture help, does the answer make sense and other questions to understand the students’  thinking. Math games provide differentiated options for partnerships to explore and practice new concepts. Across  classrooms, students turned and talked relying on questions posed by the teacher. In a self-contained class the  questions posed by the teacher did not advance dialogue among students. In most classrooms, the discussion was  managed by the teacher and occurred mostly with teacher support. Students worked in groups but rarely sought  support from peers. Questions posed by the teachers did not trigger discussion among students. Lessons seen linked to  real world applications with the options for sharing at end of lesson.

(Evidenced by our rating of  “Proficient” on Indicator 4.2 on the 2016-17 Quality Review)      Findings  Teachers are involved with collaborative inquiry using protocols and action plans. Distributive leadership structures  allow teachers to be active in the school.      Impact  Protocols and action plans guide teachers’ work to further the goals of the schools and strengthened pedagogy through  the implementation of the Common Core Learning Standards including the instructional shifts. Teacher leadership  opportunities results in shared governance focused on improved student learning across the school.  Supporting Evidence  -Teachers meet weekly to look at student work and assessments in literacy, additional sessions are scheduled to go  deeper into ensuring pacing and lessons meet their diverse learners’ needs based on data. In math, teachers plan  inquiry-based lessons using Exemplars and Context for Learning resources with the goal of increasing student  engagement and planning for differentiation. Instructional coaches support teams in using data and provide individual  support to teachers. Teams maintain meeting documents inclusive of a focus, minutes, and next steps for follow up and  tracking assignments of team tasks. Teachers determine next steps for groups of students ranging from performance far  below to exceeding standards. For example, following the analysis of the opinion writing assessment, teachers sorted  data by levels indicating percentages and number of students assigned by levels. All teacher teams continually select a  few of the class work products to look closer at, noting specific evidence of students understanding and documents their  plans using Inquiry Cycle Action Plan.      -Staff shared that they appreciate the collaborative culture that exists and that staff has the opportunity to grow in this  environment. Grade leaders meet together weekly and focus their work on schoolwide initiatives, sharing,  communicating ideas and information back to their home teams. Teachers play active role in the school such as  coordinating the Community Circle activity weekly, leading the Wellness initiatives, Student Council, art, newsletters,  and other activities. Teachers lead and participate in instructional rounds in teams that have been arranged based on  problems of practice submitted by peers. Paraprofessionals are trained in a reading intervention technique provide one  to one tutoring for targeted students. Participation in hiring and development of selection criteria are aligned to the  PEACE values. The principal shared that “There is great value placed in this community on collaboration and ownership.”      -During the teacher team observations, grade one teachers examined pre-and post-assessments to look for growth and  identify additional areas to work on. Teachers were using laptops to access student specific data and discussed changes  for the next unit based on the data and student work. The team suggested adding two other models with the conclusion  and having students talk about options for the ending. Teachers also shared successful strategies used with colleagues  and tools used that were helpful for English Language Learners. Teams follow a cycle for their work, teachers shared the  focus for grade one was close reading. Teams work together to identify learning outcomes which are designed using  student friendly format. The use of “I can” statements such as “I can use close reading ritual to organize my thinking” or  I can read for the gist of the text by note-taking loose words or short phrases.” Strategies are shared to support students       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           31      meeting the learning targets and possible options to differentiate lessons are documented on the Differentiation Menu  for the unit.    Effective School Leadership: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  (Evidenced by our rating of “Well-Developed” on Indicator 3.4 on the 2016-17 Quality Review)      High expectations are communicated through staff handbook, newsletters, email, and ongoing cycles of professional  development. The teachers’ weekly newsletters are aligned to specific aspects of Danielson Framework for Teaching  that the community is focusing upon. For example, the purposeful use of charts as instructional footprints to support  content understanding are linked demonstrating knowledge of content and pedagogy. Expectations for classroom  management is highlighted under administrative section of the newsletters and all items are aligned to the Danielson  Framework for Teaching. The weekly news provides upcoming events, highlight of good practices and expectations  including effective use of charts, inquiry in mathematics, assessments, lesson planning and school culture. The  instructional focus is to support teachers implementing the workshop model and this area was revisited throughout the  year. Teachers attend a week of professional development in the summer to help them to begin the year with clear  methods to teach using the workshop model, support with group strategies, questioning and use of mathematical  practices. Teachers commented that the school leader partners with them to meet expectations by co-teaching lessons,  modeling and engaging in open dialogue through teams, and observation feedback.      -Expectations for college and beyond are reinforced in the core values of Perseverance, Enthusiasm for learning,  Activism for social justice, Collaboration, and Empathy (PEACE). The PEACE values and mission is to cultivate college  bound learners equipped with academic, inter-personal and technological skills to participate in the global society. The  Community Circle brings all members of the school together to meet weekly and focus deeply on one of the core values.  Teachers communicate progress and recognition of growth toward core values to families through phone calls and  written comments shared in the Parent Communication Folders every Friday.         Strong Family-Community Ties: School leaders and staff consistently communicate high expectations with an emphasis  on the instructional focus and Danielson Framework for Teaching. The administrator and teachers effectively  communicate and partner with families communicating expectations and progress connected to college readiness.  (Evidenced by our rating of “Well-Developed” on Indicator 3.4 on the 2016-17 Quality Review)      -Partnership with parents results in ongoing communication regarding progress using a messaging system that allows  parents to interface with school personnel. Parents shared that teachers provide feedback to families and are always  available to support them. Teacher shared that welcoming families in for meetings, email, use of Tuesday time, and  phone calls are some ways they communicate. First grade teachers are piloting a new initiative whereby fifteen-minute  time slots are scheduled to check in with families regarding the progress towards learning and using high frequency  words and movement towards attainment of reading goals. During the parent meeting, parents stated that families are  partners and twice a month they engage in learning walks. During these walks, parents visit classrooms, see  instructional strategies, and learn about the instructional shifts and Common Core Learning Standards. Parents shared  that regular communication occurs with staff, and on Fridays the Community Circle keeps them informed about the       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           32      expectations for learning and college and career readiness.

Trust: The school community maintains a culture of mutual trust and positive attitudes that supports the academic and  personal growth of students and adults (Evidenced by our rating of “Well-Developed” on Indicator 1.4 the 2016-17  Quality Review).         Although all six areas of the Framework for Great Schools will be addressed, our priority areas of focus, deriving from  the Framework for Great Schools (and through the 2016-17 Quality Review feedback), for year 2017-18 include the  following:   Rigorous Instruction: (though our school received a rating of Proficient, this was identified as the area of focus to  meet the highest tier--well0-developed--on the Quality Review rubric.       Findings  Across classrooms teaching practices are aligned to the curricula and beliefs reflected in classrooms. Teaching strategies  provide multiple entry points into learning.      Impact  The instructional shifts and use of Danielson’s Framework for Teaching inform teaching practices so that all students are  engaged in challenging tasks. However, discussion and questioning among students did not reflect high-order thinking  skills and there was limited use of strategic scaffolding of curricula to ensure access by all learners.      Supporting Evidence  -Staff believes that students learn best when learning is authentic and provides opportunities for creative and critical  thinking. The Instructional focus is inquiry learning in math, workshop model, providing authentic reading and writing  experiences, close reading strategies, guided reading, and implementing the Math Congress. In most classroom visits,  teachers were adhering to the structure of the workshops, conducting mini-lesson, modeling, guided, independent  practices and the share component was observed. For example, in fourth grade class, students were reading closely and  using text structure to determine how the author structured the informational text.

(Evidenced by our rating of  “Proficient” on Indicator 4.2 on the 2016-17 Quality Review)      Findings  Teachers are involved with collaborative inquiry using protocols and action plans. Distributive leadership structures  allow teachers to be active in the school.      Impact  Protocols and action plans guide teachers’ work to further the goals of the schools and strengthened pedagogy through  the implementation of the Common Core Learning Standards including the instructional shifts. Teacher leadership  opportunities results in shared governance focused on improved student learning across the school.  Supporting Evidence  -Teachers meet weekly to look at student work and assessments in literacy, additional sessions are scheduled to go  deeper into ensuring pacing and lessons meet their diverse learners’ needs based on data. In math, teachers plan  inquiry-based lessons using Exemplars and Context for Learning resources with the goal of increasing student  engagement and planning for differentiation. Instructional coaches support teams in using data and provide individual  support to teachers. Teams maintain meeting documents inclusive of a focus, minutes, and next steps for follow up and  tracking assignments of team tasks. Teachers determine next steps for groups of students ranging from performance far  below to exceeding standards. For example, following the analysis of the opinion writing assessment, teachers sorted  data by levels indicating percentages and number of students assigned by levels. All teacher teams continually select a  few of the class work products to look closer at, noting specific evidence of students understanding and documents their  plans using Inquiry Cycle Action Plan.      -Staff shared that they appreciate the collaborative culture that exists and that staff has the opportunity to grow in this  environment. Grade leaders meet together weekly and focus their work on schoolwide initiatives, sharing,  communicating ideas and information back to their home teams. Teachers play active role in the school such as  coordinating the Community Circle activity weekly, leading the Wellness initiatives, Student Council, art, newsletters,  and other activities. Teachers lead and participate in instructional rounds in teams that have been arranged based on  problems of practice submitted by peers. Paraprofessionals are trained in a reading intervention technique provide one  to one tutoring for targeted students. Participation in hiring and development of selection criteria are aligned to the  PEACE values. The principal shared that “There is great value placed in this community on collaboration and ownership.”      -During the teacher team observations, grade one teachers examined pre-and post-assessments to look for growth and  identify additional areas to work on. Teachers were using laptops to access student specific data and discussed changes  for the next unit based on the data and student work. The team suggested adding two other models with the conclusion  and having students talk about options for the ending. Teachers also shared successful strategies used with colleagues  and tools used that were helpful for English Language Learners. Teams follow a cycle for their work, teachers shared the  focus for grade one was close reading. Teams work together to identify learning outcomes which are designed using  student friendly format. The use of “I can” statements such as “I can use close reading ritual to organize my thinking” or  I can read for the gist of the text by note-taking loose words or short phrases.” Strategies are shared to support students       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           39      meeting the learning targets and possible options to differentiate lessons are documented on the Differentiation Menu  for the unit.    Effective School Leadership: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  (Evidenced by our rating of “Well-Developed” on Indicator 3.4 on the 2016-17 Quality Review)      High expectations are communicated through staff handbook, newsletters, email, and ongoing cycles of professional  development. The teachers’ weekly newsletters are aligned to specific aspects of Danielson Framework for Teaching  that the community is focusing upon. For example, the purposeful use of charts as instructional footprints to support  content understanding are linked demonstrating knowledge of content and pedagogy. Expectations for classroom  management is highlighted under administrative section of the newsletters and all items are aligned to the Danielson  Framework for Teaching. The weekly news provides upcoming events, highlight of good practices and expectations  including effective use of charts, inquiry in mathematics, assessments, lesson planning and school culture. The  instructional focus is to support teachers implementing the workshop model and this area was revisited throughout the  year. Teachers attend a week of professional development in the summer to help them to begin the year with clear  methods to teach using the workshop model, support with group strategies, questioning and use of mathematical  practices. Teachers commented that the school leader partners with them to meet expectations by co-teaching lessons,  modeling and engaging in open dialogue through teams, and observation feedback.      -Expectations for college and beyond are reinforced in the core values of Perseverance, Enthusiasm for learning,  Activism for social justice, Collaboration, and Empathy (PEACE). The PEACE values and mission is to cultivate college  bound learners equipped with academic, inter-personal and technological skills to participate in the global society. The  Community Circle brings all members of the school together to meet weekly and focus deeply on one of the core values.  Teachers communicate progress and recognition of growth toward core values to families through phone calls and  written comments shared in the Parent Communication Folders every Friday.         Strong Family-Community Ties: School leaders and staff consistently communicate high expectations with an emphasis  on the instructional focus and Danielson Framework for Teaching. The administrator and teachers effectively  communicate and partner with families communicating expectations and progress connected to college readiness.  (Evidenced by our rating of “Well-Developed” on Indicator 3.4 on the 2016-17 Quality Review)      -Partnership with parents results in ongoing communication regarding progress using a messaging system that allows  parents to interface with school personnel. Parents shared that teachers provide feedback to families and are always  available to support them. Teacher shared that welcoming families in for meetings, email, use of Tuesday time, and  phone calls are some ways they communicate. First grade teachers are piloting a new initiative whereby fifteen-minute  time slots are scheduled to check in with families regarding the progress towards learning and using high frequency  words and movement towards attainment of reading goals. During the parent meeting, parents stated that families are  partners and twice a month they engage in learning walks. During these walks, parents visit classrooms, see  instructional strategies, and learn about the instructional shifts and Common Core Learning Standards. Parents shared  that regular communication occurs with staff, and on Fridays the Community Circle keeps them informed about the       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           40      expectations for learning and college and career readiness. During the Principal Choice, parents were participating in an  immigration session which was a result of recent questions and concerns among families that was organized by school  staff.   Trust: The school community maintains a culture of mutual trust and positive attitudes that supports the academic and  personal growth of students and adults (Evidenced by our rating of “Well-Developed” on Indicator 1.4 the 2016-17  Quality Review).         Although all six areas of the Framework for Great Schools will be addressed, our priority areas of focus, deriving from  the Framework for Great Schools (and through the 2016-17 Quality Review feedback), for year 2017-18 include the  following:   Rigorous Instruction: (though our school received a rating of Proficient, this was identified as the area of focus to  meet the highest tier--well0-developed--on the Quality Review rubric.       Findings  Across classrooms teaching practices are aligned to the curricula and beliefs reflected in classrooms. Teaching strategies  provide multiple entry points into learning.      Impact  The instructional shifts and use of Danielson’s Framework for Teaching inform teaching practices so that all students are  engaged in challenging tasks. However, discussion and questioning among students did not reflect high-order thinking  skills and there was limited use of strategic scaffolding of curricula to ensure access by all learners.      Supporting Evidence  -Staff believes that students learn best when learning is authentic and provides opportunities for creative and critical  thinking. The Instructional focus is inquiry learning in math, workshop model, providing authentic reading and writing  experiences, close reading strategies, guided reading, and implementing the Math Congress. In most classroom visits,  teachers were adhering to the structure of the workshops, conducting mini-lesson, modeling, guided, independent  practices and the share component was observed. For example, in fourth grade class, students were reading closely and  using text structure to determine how the author structured the informational text. Students were engaged in a mini- lesson on the rug and discussed aspects of the text as a group and then with a partner. In another grade five math class,  the investigation by students centered on an inquiry word problem connected to baking a strawberry shortcake.  Students worked in groups and used close reading to highlight key details in the problem.      -As a Transitional Bilingual School that serves over fifty-four percent English Language Learners, teachers and school  leader shared the need to ensure tiered task are created to provide entry points for students. The Differentiation Menu  is created for units and drives the plans for activities that vary content, process, and product. In a third-grade dual  language classroom students were grouped by language levels and charged with locating details, sentence complexity,       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           41      punctuation and grammar related to a common text. A checklist was used to support students in identifying how an  author organizes text. Teachers use sentence starters, graphic organizers, level texts, varying levels of Webb’s Depth of  Knowledge (DOK) for questions, customized learning center activities, and language supports provide entry points into  learning. In math, the emphasis on visual representations and creating models assists in building conceptual  understanding. In a grade two math lesson students were solving real-life problems using additional and subtraction.  Students were working in groups with access to various strategies they could employ to get entry into the problem.      -The implementation of Math Congress has allowed students to share their thinking and exposing other strategies to  students on how they could solve problems. In a fifth-grade lesson, students were working in five groups, talking about  options and approaches to solving the problem. The teacher calls the group back to the rug and selects a student and  displays the work for the class to see. The teacher probes the student about the approach used to begin solving the  problem, could objects or picture help, does the answer make sense and other questions to understand the students’  thinking. Math games provide differentiated options for partnerships to explore and practice new concepts. Across  classrooms, students turned and talked relying on questions posed by the teacher. In a self-contained class the  questions posed by the teacher did not advance dialogue among students. In most classrooms, the discussion was  managed by the teacher and occurred mostly with teacher support. Students worked in groups but rarely sought  support from peers. Questions posed by the teachers did not trigger discussion among students. Lessons seen linked to  real world applications with the options for sharing at end of lesson.        Part 2 – Annual Goal    Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers.

See Section 5, Part 2 Needs Assessment for a comprehensive overview of our school-wide data.    The elements of the Framework for Great Schools that we made the most progress in and demonstrated success over  the previous school year (2017-18) include the following:   Rigorous Instruction: We have made the most progress in providing students with rigorous instruction on our 2016-17  Quality Review, compared to the 2014-15 Quality Review.       Findings  Across classrooms teaching practices are aligned to the curricula and beliefs reflected in classrooms. Teaching strategies  provide multiple entry points into learning.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           49         Impact  The instructional shifts and use of Danielson’s Framework for Teaching inform teaching practices so that all students are  engaged in challenging tasks.       Supporting Evidence  -Staff believes that students learn best when learning is authentic and provides opportunities for creative and critical  thinking. The Instructional focus is inquiry learning in math, workshop model, providing authentic reading and writing  experiences, close reading strategies, guided reading, and implementing the Math Congress. In most classroom visits,  teachers were adhering to the structure of the workshops, conducting mini-lesson, modeling, guided, independent  practices and the share component was observed. For example, in fourth grade class, students were reading closely and  using text structure to determine how the author structured the informational text. Students were engaged in a mini- lesson on the rug and discussed aspects of the text as a group and then with a partner. In another grade five math class,  the investigation by students centered on an inquiry word problem connected to baking a strawberry shortcake.  Students worked in groups and used close reading to highlight key details in the problem.      -As a Dual Language Bilingual School that serves over fifty-four percent English Language Learners, teachers and school  leader shared the need to ensure tiered task are created to provide entry points for students. The Differentiation Menu  is created for units and drives the plans for activities that vary content, process, and product. In a third-grade dual  language classroom students were grouped by language levels and charged with locating details, sentence complexity,  punctuation and grammar related to a common text. A checklist was used to support students in identifying how an  author organizes text. Teachers use sentence starters, graphic organizers, level texts, varying levels of Webb’s Depth of  Knowledge (DOK) for questions, customized learning center activities, and language supports provide entry points into  learning. In math, the emphasis on visual representations and creating models assists in building conceptual  understanding. In a grade two math lesson students were solving real-life problems using additional and subtraction.  Students were working in groups with access to various strategies they could employ to get entry into the problem.      -The implementation of Math Congress has allowed students to share their thinking and exposing other strategies to  students on how they could solve problems. In a fifth-grade lesson, students were working in five groups, talking about  options and approaches to solving the problem. The teacher calls the group back to the rug and selects a student and  displays the work for the class to see. The teacher probes the student about the approach used to begin solving the  problem, could objects or picture help, does the answer make sense and other questions to understand the students’  thinking. Math games provide differentiated options for partnerships to explore and practice new concepts. Across  classrooms, students turned and talked relying on questions posed by the teacher. In a self-contained class the  questions posed by the teacher did not advance dialogue among students. In most classrooms, the discussion was  managed by the teacher and occurred mostly with teacher support. Students worked in groups but rarely sought  support from peers. Questions posed by the teachers did not trigger discussion among students. Lessons seen linked to  real world applications with the options for sharing at end of lesson.   Supportive Environment : The school maintains a culture of mutual trust and positive attitudes that supports the  academic and personal growth of students and adults.

(Evidenced by our rating of  “Proficient” on Indicator 4.2 on the 2016-17 Quality Review)      Findings  Teachers are involved with collaborative inquiry using protocols and action plans. Distributive leadership structures  allow teachers to be active in the school.      Impact  Protocols and action plans guide teachers’ work to further the goals of the schools and strengthened pedagogy through  the implementation of the Common Core Learning Standards including the instructional shifts. Teacher leadership  opportunities results in shared governance focused on improved student learning across the school.  Supporting Evidence  -Teachers meet weekly to look at student work and assessments in literacy, additional sessions are scheduled to go  deeper into ensuring pacing and lessons meet their diverse learners’ needs based on data. In math, teachers plan  inquiry-based lessons using Exemplars and Context for Learning resources with the goal of increasing student  engagement and planning for differentiation. Instructional coaches support teams in using data and provide individual  support to teachers. Teams maintain meeting documents inclusive of a focus, minutes, and next steps for follow up and  tracking assignments of team tasks. Teachers determine next steps for groups of students ranging from performance far  below to exceeding standards. For example, following the analysis of the opinion writing assessment, teachers sorted  data by levels indicating percentages and number of students assigned by levels. All teacher teams continually select a  few of the class work products to look closer at, noting specific evidence of students understanding and documents their  plans using Inquiry Cycle Action Plan.      -Staff shared that they appreciate the collaborative culture that exists and that staff has the opportunity to grow in this  environment. Grade leaders meet together weekly and focus their work on schoolwide initiatives, sharing,  communicating ideas and information back to their home teams. Teachers play active role in the school such as  coordinating the Community Circle activity weekly, leading the Wellness initiatives, Student Council, art, newsletters,  and other activities. Teachers lead and participate in instructional rounds in teams that have been arranged based on  problems of practice submitted by peers. Paraprofessionals are trained in a reading intervention technique provide one  to one tutoring for targeted students. Participation in hiring and development of selection criteria are aligned to the  PEACE values. The principal shared that “There is great value placed in this community on collaboration and ownership.”      -During the teacher team observations, grade one teachers examined pre-and post-assessments to look for growth and  identify additional areas to work on. Teachers were using laptops to access student specific data and discussed changes  for the next unit based on the data and student work. The team suggested adding two other models with the conclusion  and having students talk about options for the ending. Teachers also shared successful strategies used with colleagues  and tools used that were helpful for English Language Learners. Teams follow a cycle for their work, teachers shared the  focus for grade one was close reading. Teams work together to identify learning outcomes which are designed using  student friendly format. The use of “I can” statements such as “I can use close reading ritual to organize my thinking” or  I can read for the gist of the text by note-taking loose words or short phrases.” Strategies are shared to support students       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           51      meeting the learning targets and possible options to differentiate lessons are documented on the Differentiation Menu  for the unit.       Effective School Leadership: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  (Evidenced by our rating of “Well-Developed” on Indicator 3.4 on the 2016-17 Quality Review)      High expectations are communicated through staff handbook, newsletters, email, and ongoing cycles of professional  development. The teachers’ weekly newsletters are aligned to specific aspects of Danielson Framework for Teaching  that the community is focusing upon. For example, the purposeful use of charts as instructional footprints to support  content understanding are linked demonstrating knowledge of content and pedagogy. Expectations for classroom  management is highlighted under administrative section of the newsletters and all items are aligned to the Danielson  Framework for Teaching. The weekly news provides upcoming events, highlight of good practices and expectations  including effective use of charts, inquiry in mathematics, assessments, lesson planning and school culture. The  instructional focus is to support teachers implementing the workshop model and this area was revisited throughout the  year. Teachers attend a week of professional development in the summer to help them to begin the year with clear  methods to teach using the workshop model, support with group strategies, questioning and use of mathematical  practices. Teachers commented that the school leader partners with them to meet expectations by co-teaching lessons,  modeling and engaging in open dialogue through teams, and observation feedback.      -Expectations for college and beyond are reinforced in the core values of Perseverance, Enthusiasm for learning,  Activism for social justice, Collaboration, and Empathy (PEACE). The PEACE values and mission is to cultivate college  bound learners equipped with academic, inter-personal and technological skills to participate in the global society. The  Community Circle brings all members of the school together to meet weekly and focus deeply on one of the core values.  Teachers communicate progress and recognition of growth toward core values to families through phone calls and  written comments shared in the Parent Communication Folders every Friday.         Strong Family-Community Ties: School leaders and staff consistently communicate high expectations with an emphasis  on the instructional focus and Danielson Framework for Teaching. The administrator and teachers effectively  communicate and partner with families communicating expectations and progress connected to college readiness.  (Evidenced by our rating of “Well-Developed” on Indicator 3.4 on the 2016-17 Quality Review)      -Partnership with parents results in ongoing communication regarding progress using a messaging system that allows  parents to interface with school personnel. Parents shared that teachers provide feedback to families and are always  available to support them. Teacher shared that welcoming families in for meetings, email, use of Tuesday time, and  phone calls are some ways they communicate. First grade teachers are piloting a new initiative whereby fifteen-minute  time slots are scheduled to check in with families regarding the progress towards learning and using high frequency  words and movement towards attainment of reading goals. During the parent meeting, parents stated that families are  partners and twice a month they engage in learning walks. During these walks, parents visit classrooms, see       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           52      instructional strategies, and learn about the instructional shifts and Common Core Learning Standards. Parents shared  that regular communication occurs with staff, and on Fridays the Community Circle keeps them informed about the  expectations for learning and college and career readiness. During the Principal Choice, parents were participating in an  immigration session which was a result of recent questions and concerns among families that was organized by school  staff.   Trust: The school community maintains a culture of mutual trust and positive attitudes that supports the academic and  personal growth of students and adults (Evidenced by our rating of “Well-Developed” on Indicator 1.4 the 2016-17  Quality Review).         Although all six areas of the Framework for Great Schools will be addressed, our priority areas of focus, deriving from  the Framework for Great Schools (and through the 2016-17 Quality Review feedback), for year 2017-18 include the  following:   Rigorous Instruction: (though our school received a rating of Proficient, this was identified as the area of focus to  meet the highest tier--well0-developed--on the Quality Review rubric.

The elements of the Framework for Great Schools that we made the most progress in and demonstrated success over  the previous school year (2017-18) include the following:   Rigorous Instruction: We have made the most progress in providing students with rigorous instruction on our 2016-17  Quality Review, compared to the 2014-15 Quality Review.       Findings  Across classrooms teaching practices are aligned to the curricula and beliefs reflected in classrooms. Teaching strategies  provide multiple entry points into learning.          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           58      Impact  The instructional shifts and use of Danielson’s Framework for Teaching inform teaching practices so that all students are  engaged in challenging tasks.       Supporting Evidence  -Staff believes that students learn best when learning is authentic and provides opportunities for creative and critical  thinking. The Instructional focus is inquiry learning in math, workshop model, providing authentic reading and writing  experiences, close reading strategies, guided reading, and implementing the Math Congress. In most classroom visits,  teachers were adhering to the structure of the workshops, conducting mini-lesson, modeling, guided, independent  practices and the share component was observed. For example, in fourth grade class, students were reading closely and  using text structure to determine how the author structured the informational text. Students were engaged in a mini- lesson on the rug and discussed aspects of the text as a group and then with a partner. In another grade five math class,  the investigation by students centered on an inquiry word problem connected to baking a strawberry shortcake.  Students worked in groups and used close reading to highlight key details in the problem.      -As a Dual Language Bilingual School that serves over fifty-four percent English Language Learners, teachers and school  leader shared the need to ensure tiered task are created to provide entry points for students. The Differentiation Menu  is created for units and drives the plans for activities that vary content, process, and product. In a third-grade dual  language classroom students were grouped by language levels and charged with locating details, sentence complexity,  punctuation and grammar related to a common text. A checklist was used to support students in identifying how an  author organizes text. Teachers use sentence starters, graphic organizers, level texts, varying levels of Webb’s Depth of  Knowledge (DOK) for questions, customized learning center activities, and language supports provide entry points into  learning. In math, the emphasis on visual representations and creating models assists in building conceptual  understanding. In a grade two math lesson students were solving real-life problems using additional and subtraction.  Students were working in groups with access to various strategies they could employ to get entry into the problem.      -The implementation of Math Congress has allowed students to share their thinking and exposing other strategies to  students on how they could solve problems. In a fifth-grade lesson, students were working in five groups, talking about  options and approaches to solving the problem. The teacher calls the group back to the rug and selects a student and  displays the work for the class to see. The teacher probes the student about the approach used to begin solving the  problem, could objects or picture help, does the answer make sense and other questions to understand the students’  thinking. Math games provide differentiated options for partnerships to explore and practice new concepts. Across  classrooms, students turned and talked relying on questions posed by the teacher. In a self-contained class the  questions posed by the teacher did not advance dialogue among students. In most classrooms, the discussion was  managed by the teacher and occurred mostly with teacher support. Students worked in groups but rarely sought  support from peers. Questions posed by the teachers did not trigger discussion among students. Lessons seen linked to  real world applications with the options for sharing at end of lesson.   Supportive Environment : The school maintains a culture of mutual trust and positive attitudes that supports the  academic and personal growth of students and adults.

(Evidenced by our rating of  “Proficient” on Indicator 4.2 on the 2016-17 Quality Review)      Findings  Teachers are involved with collaborative inquiry using protocols and action plans. Distributive leadership structures  allow teachers to be active in the school.      Impact  Protocols and action plans guide teachers’ work to further the goals of the schools and strengthened pedagogy through  the implementation of the Common Core Learning Standards including the instructional shifts. Teacher leadership  opportunities results in shared governance focused on improved student learning across the school.  Supporting Evidence  -Teachers meet weekly to look at student work and assessments in literacy, additional sessions are scheduled to go  deeper into ensuring pacing and lessons meet their diverse learners’ needs based on data. In math, teachers plan  inquiry-based lessons using Exemplars and Context for Learning resources with the goal of increasing student  engagement and planning for differentiation. Instructional coaches support teams in using data and provide individual  support to teachers. Teams maintain meeting documents inclusive of a focus, minutes, and next steps for follow up and  tracking assignments of team tasks. Teachers determine next steps for groups of students ranging from performance far  below to exceeding standards. For example, following the analysis of the opinion writing assessment, teachers sorted  data by levels indicating percentages and number of students assigned by levels. All teacher teams continually select a  few of the class work products to look closer at, noting specific evidence of students understanding and documents their  plans using Inquiry Cycle Action Plan.      -Staff shared that they appreciate the collaborative culture that exists and that staff has the opportunity to grow in this  environment. Grade leaders meet together weekly and focus their work on schoolwide initiatives, sharing,  communicating ideas and information back to their home teams. Teachers play active role in the school such as  coordinating the Community Circle activity weekly, leading the Wellness initiatives, Student Council, art, newsletters,  and other activities. Teachers lead and participate in instructional rounds in teams that have been arranged based on  problems of practice submitted by peers. Paraprofessionals are trained in a reading intervention technique provide one  to one tutoring for targeted students. Participation in hiring and development of selection criteria are aligned to the  PEACE values. The principal shared that “There is great value placed in this community on collaboration and ownership.”      -During the teacher team observations, grade one teachers examined pre-and post-assessments to look for growth and  identify additional areas to work on. Teachers were using laptops to access student specific data and discussed changes  for the next unit based on the data and student work. The team suggested adding two other models with the conclusion  and having students talk about options for the ending. Teachers also shared successful strategies used with colleagues  and tools used that were helpful for English Language Learners. Teams follow a cycle for their work, teachers shared the  focus for grade one was close reading. Teams work together to identify learning outcomes which are designed using  student friendly format. The use of “I can” statements such as “I can use close reading ritual to organize my thinking” or  I can read for the gist of the text by note-taking loose words or short phrases.” Strategies are shared to support students       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           60      meeting the learning targets and possible options to differentiate lessons are documented on the Differentiation Menu  for the unit.    Effective School Leadership: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  (Evidenced by our rating of “Well-Developed” on Indicator 3.4 on the 2016-17 Quality Review)      High expectations are communicated through staff handbook, newsletters, email, and ongoing cycles of professional  development. The teachers’ weekly newsletters are aligned to specific aspects of Danielson Framework for Teaching  that the community is focusing upon. For example, the purposeful use of charts as instructional footprints to support  content understanding are linked demonstrating knowledge of content and pedagogy. Expectations for classroom  management is highlighted under administrative section of the newsletters and all items are aligned to the Danielson  Framework for Teaching. The weekly news provides upcoming events, highlight of good practices and expectations  including effective use of charts, inquiry in mathematics, assessments, lesson planning and school culture. The  instructional focus is to support teachers implementing the workshop model and this area was revisited throughout the  year. Teachers attend a week of professional development in the summer to help them to begin the year with clear  methods to teach using the workshop model, support with group strategies, questioning and use of mathematical  practices. Teachers commented that the school leader partners with them to meet expectations by co-teaching lessons,  modeling and engaging in open dialogue through teams, and observation feedback.      -Expectations for college and beyond are reinforced in the core values of Perseverance, Enthusiasm for learning,  Activism for social justice, Collaboration, and Empathy (PEACE). The PEACE values and mission is to cultivate college  bound learners equipped with academic, inter-personal and technological skills to participate in the global society. The  Community Circle brings all members of the school together to meet weekly and focus deeply on one of the core values.  Teachers communicate progress and recognition of growth toward core values to families through phone calls and  written comments shared in the Parent Communication Folders every Friday.         Strong Family-Community Ties: School leaders and staff consistently communicate high expectations with an emphasis  on the instructional focus and Danielson Framework for Teaching. The administrator and teachers effectively  communicate and partner with families communicating expectations and progress connected to college readiness.  (Evidenced by our rating of “Well-Developed” on Indicator 3.4 on the 2016-17 Quality Review)      -Partnership with parents results in ongoing communication regarding progress using a messaging system that allows  parents to interface with school personnel. Parents shared that teachers provide feedback to families and are always  available to support them. Teacher shared that welcoming families in for meetings, email, use of Tuesday time, and  phone calls are some ways they communicate. First grade teachers are piloting a new initiative whereby fifteen-minute  time slots are scheduled to check in with families regarding the progress towards learning and using high frequency  words and movement towards attainment of reading goals. During the parent meeting, parents stated that families are  partners and twice a month they engage in learning walks. During these walks, parents visit classrooms, see  instructional strategies, and learn about the instructional shifts and Common Core Learning Standards. Parents shared  that regular communication occurs with staff, and on Fridays the Community Circle keeps them informed about the       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           61      expectations for learning and college and career readiness. During the Principal Choice, parents were participating in an  immigration session which was a result of recent questions and concerns among families that was organized by school  staff.   Trust: The school community maintains a culture of mutual trust and positive attitudes that supports the academic and  personal growth of students and adults (Evidenced by our rating of “Well-Developed” on Indicator 1.4 the 2016-17  Quality Review).         Although all six areas of the Framework for Great Schools will be addressed, our priority areas of focus, deriving from  the Framework for Great Schools (and through the 2016-17 Quality Review feedback), for year 2017-18 include the  following:   Rigorous Instruction: (though our school received a rating of Proficient, this was identified as the area of focus to  meet the highest tier--well0-developed--on the Quality Review rubric.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  Recruitment of highly qualified teachers is conducted through posting positions through our website,  recommendations from staff and by posting the announcements with the DOE through the Early Hiring Program, New  Teacher Finder and Open Market.   Efforts are made to retain highly qualified staff by providing distributive leadership. In this way, teachers are provided  with vast opportunities to serve in leadership roles. Teachers lead grade teams, committees, lead PD workshops, and  serve on our MOSL team. In addition, teachers are asked to participate in peer partnerships so that they can provide  one another with feedback using the Danielson Rubric and the school’s Classroom Environment Rubric to evaluate  instructional and environmental practices.   In addition, we have offered teachers the opportunity to obtain a recommendation from the Principal for obtaining a  license in Bilingual Education and TESOL so that they may be provided with additional opportunities to serve the  school-wide community. We currently have two teachers that have taken advantage of these opportunities. One  teacher is a Spanish speaking classroom teacher who is on track to receive a supplementary bilingual certification and  the other teacher is a general education teacher who is obtaining her TESOL license to serve as an ESL provider when  the opportunity arises at our school.   High quality professional development is provided through an ongoing series of on-site and off-site workshops.  Teachers are encouraged to register for professional development opportunities off-site. In addition, teachers receive  PD through our Monday PD time after school. During this time, teachers have covered topics such as backwards  planning, differentiated instruction, team teaching, opinion writing, crafting text-dependent questions, and reviewing  data to make it actionable. In addition, we have carved out two additional periods (beyond the 5 preps teachers are  eligible to receive per week). During this time, the teachers meet in teacher teams with the support of the literacy and  math coach to plan instruction, review data, craft performance tasks, and reflect on the unit.   In addition, we have hired ELA (Generation Ready) and Math consultants (Metamorphosis Math) to continue to  support teachers in shared reading, guided reading, and math planning. The consultants meet with grade teams twice  per month. The consultants primarily use a cycle of plan-teach/co-teach-debrief for a 2.5 hour long session. During  this time, periods are scheduled so classrooms are provided with coverage so that teachers can participate in the PD.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           70      The teachers plan with the consultant, try out the lesson with the support of the consultant, and then debrief on the  lesson delivery and what revisions need to be made the following time.              2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the strategies and activities for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, staff, and  paraprofessionals that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   High quality professional development is provided through an ongoing series of on-site and off-site workshops.  Teachers and para-professionals are encouraged to register for professional development opportunities off-site. In  addition, teachers and para-professionals receive PD through our Monday PD time after school. During this time,  teachers have covered topics such as backwards planning, differentiated instruction, team teaching, opinion writing,  crafting text-dependent questions, and reviewing data to make it actionable. In addition, we have carved out two  additional periods (beyond the 5 preps teachers are eligible to receive per week). During this time, the teachers meet  in teacher teams with the support of the literacy and math coach to plan instruction, review data, craft performance  tasks, and reflect on the unit.      Differentiated professional development will be offered to teachers. Data from informal/formal Advance  observations, teachers' professional goals, and teacher professional interests based on self-reflection will be used to  tailor professional development opportunities.    In addition, we have hired ELA (Generation Ready) and Math consultants (Generation Ready and Metamorphosis  Math) to support teachers in shared reading, guided reading, and math planning. The consultants meet with grade  teams twice per month. The consultants primarily use a cycle of plan-teach/co-teach-debrief for a 2.5 hour long  session. During this time, periods are scheduled so classrooms are provided with coverage so that teachers can  participate in the PD. The teachers plan with the consultant, try out the lesson with the support of the consultant, and  then debrief on the lesson delivery and what revisions need to be made the following time.      Teachers are sent off-site each week to PDs offered across the content areas. Some include: Metamorphosis Math  Planning Days, Social Studies Passport training, STEM workshops, WILSON training.       Also, teachers participated in high-level professional development in several day conferences in various states for  learning cutting-edge practices in ELA and Math (i.e. ASCD Conference in California; NCTM Math Conference in San  Antonio, Texas.) Teachers also participate in the Literacy Design Collaborative Project (LDC) and have been invited  through a grant to present at a conference in Nashville, Tennessee in July 2017.       Furthermore, paras are being trained by our IEP teacher on guided reading practices so that they may support student  groups in the classrooms.          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           71       Part 3: TA Schools Only   3a. Use of Program Resources   Describe how the TA program resources will assist participating children to meet proficiency.  N/A        3b. TA Coordination with the Regular Program   Describe the planning, coordination and support of the TA program with the regular educational program (i.e.,  providing ELT, accelerated, high-quality curriculum, including applied learning; and minimize removing children from  the regular classroom during regular school day).  N/A        Part 4: SWP Schools Only   4a. Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/information,  early intervention services, etc.).  To help make the transition, parents and future kindergarten students are invited to participate in a summer  orientation program each August. During that time, parents and students are invited into the building to see the  classrooms of the children, meet the teachers, ask questions, and to learn about policies and procedures of the  school. In addition, parents are invited to meet one-on-one with staff throughout the remaining portion of the  summer by providing us with their most convenient contact information. Students are provided with a school  uniform.   Parents are provided with PD from the beginning of the year so that they may learn about the standards. Topics  covered include Reading Standards, Writing Standards, Math Standards, Handwriting Workshop, Motivating Students  to Learn. In addition, our Parent Coordinator supports parents in navigating the elementary school system. Parents of  Kindergarten students have been actively recruited through phone calls, flyers, and invitations to participate in  events. A kindergarten luncheon for families of Kinder students is scheduled in December to address the needs of  parents in navigating the system.        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Teachers are an integral part of the assessment review process. Teachers collect data through writing baseline  assessments, math assessments, reading assessments, and formative assessments in the classroom. Teachers review  data as part of their teacher teams. They make decisions about the data by reviewing the information, broken down  by subgroups to decide what next steps need to be taken in their classrooms, as well as adaptations that need to be  made in the unit plans.   Teachers voices are heard to help in making assessment related decisions. At the end of the year, we had a meeting  with a teacher committee to assess the number of Fountas & Pinnell reading assessments conducted throughout the  year. They informed that the information collected 6 times a year was excessive. They recommended that students be       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           72      assessed in Reading through the Fountas & Pinnell 3 times per year. This would allow teachers to address topics on a  deeper level.   Professional development around the review of data and making it actionable is visible in our Monday PD sessions  with teachers and para-professionals. In addition, we have carved out two additional periods (beyond the 5 preps  teachers are eligible to receive per week). Teachers are provided time with their Teacher Teams to review data and  make plans on how this will impact units of study and how they might use this data to make decisions about how to  support students. These findings go into their module revision templates in both Math and ELA.    In addition, a teacher MOSL selection committee made recommendations on the types of assessments that we would  link teachers in the school to for the MOSL.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           73     may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           74           Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG or SIF funds: These funds   must be used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant  application.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           75      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. 09X311, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families.

Addendum: Community School Partnerships   Directions: The Community School (CS) strategy is directly aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. Community  Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and  family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in  Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health &  Wellness.    Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s)   How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student  academic outcomes?   The Community Schools strategy has been integrated into our school by providing students with counseling services  and extended learning time, as well as parent training.       The impact has been that in the 2016-17 ELA and Math exams we showed the greatest growth across the city--#3 in  ELA and #7 in math. The students also have shown a decrease in social-emotional crises. They have been able to  academically perform and perform higher in the classrooms.       Abbott House works together with staff to ensure that all students are receiving the supports they need to increase  overall academic performance including mental health services. They offer new trainings to our staff in TCIS. Abbott  House is a part of our Crisis Team,SIT team and Attendance team. Together the school is able to help students in all  aspects in order to achieve their greatest successes.          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           82      Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year.

Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to  strengthen this initiative.  Community Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and  families feel welcome, actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of  their schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community  School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this family engagement  strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work.  Community School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director,  select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual  students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use.  Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work.   Abbott House will keep in communication with staff during attendance meetings, IEP meetings and SIT meetings  regards students who need support.

Now, at full capacity--Grades K-5--we provide students with  General Education, Dual Language, Dual Language ICT, and Self-Contained classes.   Currently, register data informs us that 50% students (199 students) are English Language  Learners. In addition, 92% of the students are of Hispanic ethnicity. It is expected that because of  the demographic and register data, the Dual Language program will provide English Language  Learners (ELLs) with a relevant service for ensuring that their language needs are met.  Currently, we have Dual Language Programs in Grade K and in Grade 1,  one Dual Language  ICT and one Dual Language in Grade 2 and 3,  one Dual Language in Grades 4 and 5. Thus, the  Dual Language program target ELLs and English dominant students in Grades K and 5, and  provide instruction in English and Spanish to student participants.   Research indicates that some of the benefits of a Dual Language program for ELLs and English  dominant students include:  proficiency in first and second language (English and Spanish), an  appreciation of people from different cultures, and outperform in state exams compared to  students in monolingual classrooms. In addition, a Dual Language program provides ELLs with  an additive approach to language acquisition. In this way, students’ first language is valued,  nurtured, and used as a foundation upon which a new language may be learned proficiently. The  21st century world in which our students live in, requires individuals who have strong  communication, empathy, and innovation skills. A Dual Language program provides the  groundwork for developing these skills in our students, as it provides students with opportunities  to bridge cultures, empathize with individuals of diverse backgrounds, and learn various  approaches to problem-solve in light of new found understandings. Through participation in the  program, our students will be able to gain the skills necessary for becoming full participants in  the social, economic, and political systems of our world.   The instructional infrastructure of Dual Language programs provide greatly increased  educational productivity because it offers full rather than partial achievement gap closure at  annual costs comparable with existing programs. Traditional programs for English learners  provide watered-down instruction in basic English, virtually guaranteeing that the native English  speakers will outperform English learners and thus widen the achievement gap over time.  English learners need enriched, sustained forms of instruction that allow them to receive support  in their first language while learning a second language. Dual Language programs offer English  learners a mainstream curriculum, which leads to full English proficiency and curricular mastery,  with instruction provided by monolingual and multilingual teachers who already work within the  school system (“The Multiple Benefits of Dual Language”, Educational Leadership, Thomas &  Collier, October 2003, V.61, No.2, pgs. 61-64).       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           87         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   Planned activities and securing of resources to ensure the success and support of ELLS in the  Dual Language and ENL/ESL programs, through Title III funds include the following:          After-school programming for ELLs: The after-school program will focus on English language  development.The program will begin on October 17, 2018 and it will end on April 25, 2019. The  total # of session is 60.  The number of sessions will be  on Wednesdays and Thursdays from  2:20 to 4:20 PM.   It will target all ELLs in Grades 2-5. Each grade,  20 students will be served.  In the first hour of the program, the students will focus on ELA. In particular they will focus on  close reading and writing about reading. For ELA the students will use the I-ready program.  They will focus on Reading float fluency, writing, a word work. Their data will be trapped on the  I-ready program.  In the second hour, students will engage in discussion and debates to improve  their oral language and listening skills.  During Math, they do inquriry math and math  fluency.  They us the Go Math program and context for learning mathematics program. Each  week on Thursday the teachers will provide students with an exit ticket. The exit ticket will  target a specific strategy that students need to be able to focus on or on the content. The students  who do not demonstrate mastery will be invited to participate in different small  groups within  their afterschool math.   The language of instruction for the afterschool programming will be in English.  Students will  receive whole language support through the use of a paraprofessional or dictionary and  glossaries.  The teachers will use direct instruction, small group instruction and one on one instruction to  support needs of individual learners.  The teachers will use i-ready, Go-Math materials during the afterschool programming.  The instructional materials that will be used will include supplemental Ready Gen materials  including Close Reading Sleuth and iReady books. In addition, we will use iPads to develop  language using the Starfall program and Reading A-Z. We will also use the Voices program to  conduct close reading.   The attendance will be taken by the teachers and it will be collected and kept the records in the  main office.  The total cost of our program will be S36,390 and we receive a Title 111 allocation amount of  $25,038. The remaining $10,352 will be supplemented with Tax Levy funds.

ELLs require scaffolding and differentiation to  ensure that they are able to make content comprehensible. Thus, teachers will be provided with  PD workshops on site to address their PD needs.      The PD that will be offered and funded through Title III will be offered to all teachers on staff,  with a maximum of 10 teachers per workshop and prioritizing bilingual certified teachers in the       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           88         Part C: Professional Development   Title III program. Two sessions of PD will be offered to up to 10 teachers per session. Each  session will last for two hours. The topics to be covered include the following:  -Oral language strategies to support beginning ELLs  -Vocabulary building to support ELLs at Various Levels     In addition, we will support this work through Monday PD time at 2:20-3:40p.m. Teachers will  be engaged in a study group focusing on differentiated instruction for ELLs. There will be a  facilitator who will use protocols to engage participants. Teachers will be asked to identify areas  that they will develop in their own practice each week. Peer partnerships will be established to  encourage teachers to provide feedback to their peers based on what they implement after the  training. Teachers will debrief on challenges and successes made at the beginning of each  meeting.   Teachers will meet every first Monday of each month for 45 minutes.  The total of 10 sessions  will be provided by at no costs.  Topics will include teaching vocabulary, phrases, fluency and writing to ELL students.   Our ENL Coordinator, Kyeyeon Park, will facilitate the PD workshops for teachers. The agendas  and attendance will be kept in the ELL binders.  These PDs will help new teachers to understand  ELL students needs and how to help them better.  ENL teachers (Ms. Park & Ms. Monestime) will attend ENL related PDs to get more information  about the topics.      Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact  higher achievement for ELLs.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  We have collected data for through Fountas and Pinnell reading levels in English & Spanish, Baseline Writing Assessments for  K-5, and using the Estrellita Phonics (Spanish) Assessment to assess Kindergarten ELL early literacy skills. We administered i- ready diagnostic tests 3 times in a year.  In Reading, 46% of students are performing on Level 1. In Writing, 35% of students are  performing on Level 1, and 56% are performing at a Level 2. As we have just have received our Core Curriculum materials (Lit  Life Reading and Writing, GoMath, FOSS Science Kits) and have completed MoSL.  Once we complete our diagnostic data  collection, we will be able to group students and target students depending on where they are in their knowledge of phonics       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           93      and phonemic awareness.  Both the Estreillita and Fundations programs helps teachers in grouping students and tailoring  instruction according to proficiency levels.        2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Reading recovery teachers serve four first grade struggling readers daily for 30 minutes to support their literacy strategy.       3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Our Dual Language success is measured by two critical benchmarks:  (1) growth by at least 1.5 years in reading utilizing data  collected on the  Fountas and Pinnell reading levels in Spanish, and (2) growth from at least one performance level on teacher  created Writing and Math unit assessments.  By analyzing the assessments data, we will focus on our student gains in content  knowledge mastery as well as their language acquisition in Reading, Writing, Listening, and Speaking.         4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Teachers display students reading levels in the big chart in the classroom and grouped them into similar reading groups for  guided group reading.The students who are in Tier III, receive Reading Rescue. Students in Tier II receive AIS at least twice a  week. Students in Tier 1 are provided with close reading, after school, and Saturday School.        5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   PS 311 uses data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention Framework. In Grade K, students are  diagnostically assessed on their Concepts about Print. If students score a total of 41 points, it is determined that the student is  able to be assessed in reading using the Fountas and Pinnell reading levels. Students assessed through the  Fountas and Pinnell reading levels are asked to read while the teacher takes a running record. Comprehension is assessed  through a set of questions students must answer. The data allows us to group students according to reading levels and  understanding of reading skills and concepts (predicting, summarizing, vocabulary, setting). Students are grouped according to  levels. If the student's reading level is one level below grade level, an RTI group (Tier II) will be formed for six weeks to focus in  on an area of need gleaned through data. If the children are performing two levels below grade level the children will be  grouped in a smaller group or one-to-one with a teacher. The reason we must group the students performing in Level 1 is  because of the high concentration of Level 1 students. Some students who require one-on-one, Tier III support will work with  the Reading Recovery teacher. Others will have one-on-one time during a period designated with the AIS teacher.  RTI groups  are and will be formed every six weeks for Math and for Literacy. Teachers will keep logs detailing the focus for the group,  participants in the group, expected outcome, and strategies that will be used. At the end of the six week period, teachers will  determine if the student will need to remain in the group, move to another group where additional support is needed (Tier II  or III), or can function within a Tier I group. Every six weeks the cycle begins again.            6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   RLAT, RNMR, and RESI are used to run EDAT.     Below are are our data results from the 2016-17 exams:    Math: 19% level 3 and 4       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           94         ELA: 25% level 3 and 4  NYSESLAT:   56% of students with comparison scores from previous year grew 1 or more levels.   38% of students with comparison scores from previous year showed no growth.  6% of students with comparison scores from previous year went down 1 level.  28% of students had no data from the previous year to compare to (as they were new to the country)    Here is a breakdown of our ENL Levels for 2017-18 thus far:  Entering= 37  Emergent= 24  Transitioning= 26  Expanding= 75  Commanding=0     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   ENL teacher updates the data if there's any changes to run EDAT to see the current data. The ELL Data Analysis Tool is an  amazing tool to use as resource when disseminating data. The EDAT is a tool that allows schools to download 3 ATS reports  and then provides them a summary of their school’s status and students’ achievement and progress. The EDAT also allows  schools to target instructional programs to accelerate achievement among both ELLs and non-ELLs.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   The ENL Program is served by two ENL teachers.     1 teacher serves students in Grades K-2. The other serves students in Grades 3-5.

The teachers also pull  Entering, Expanding students receive pull out services 180 additional minutes to provide additional vocabulary  building, close reading, writing, speaking, and listening. The teachers push into ELA periods.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      The Dual Language classes offer 360 minutes of ESL instruction. In Kindergarten, this is accomplished through math  and social studies being taught for a total of 360 minutes per week in English. In grades 1 through 5, the classes are  taught over 360 minutes per week to address the ESL mandates. The Dual Language programs in these grades are  50/50 instruction in English and Spanish. Thus, students are taught content in both languages. Students switch classes  every three days. They go to an English class for the English days. They go to a Spanish classroom on Spanish speaking  days.       2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           95      a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?           The ENL Program is served by two ENL teachers.     1 teacher serves students in Grades K-2. The other serves students in Grades 3-5. The teachers push in to classrooms for 180  minutes to co-teach with the classroom teacher. They teach a mixed levels group. The teachers also pull Entering, Expanding  students receive pull out services 180 additional minutes to provide additional vocabulary building, close reading, writing,  speaking, and listening. The teachers push into ELA periods.     The ENL teacher in grade 2 serves as a co-teacher four days per week for 45 minutes per day as a co-teacher during the ELA  period. Students are heterogeneously grouped so that they may learn from one another.       HLA is taught every three days. Students switch classrooms to the designated language of the day classroom..     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      T  The ENL Program is served by two ENL teachers.     1 teacher serves students in Grades K-2. The other serves students in Grades 3-5.

The teachers push into ELA periods.     Students are heterogeneously grouped so that they may learn from one another. In addition , for Dual Language programs  please note the following: The Dual Language classes offer 360 minutes of ESL instruction. In Kindergarten, this is  accomplished through math and social studies being taught for a total of 360 minutes per week in English. In grades 1 through  4, the classes are taught over 360 minutes per week to address the ESL mandates. The Dual Language programs in these  grades are 50/50 instruction in English and Spanish. Thus, students are taught content in both languages in each content area.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      The students are assessed in their home language through the NYCDOE guidelines for Spanish Native Language Arts. This  includes a rubric of a student profile. Teachers will use this profile to assess the work that students produce in Spanish and to  provide students and their parents with feedback for their improvement.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    A. SIFE students will be provided with Reading Rescue to catch them up on any reading gaps. They will receive Guided Reading  at least 3 days per week. They will receive AIS services. They will receive after school and Saturday School opportunities.   B. Students who are newcomers are provided with supports such as books in their native language, a language buddy to  translate, materials are provided in their native language, picture supports and charts are provided in the classroom, personal  word walls are provided to each student.   C. Students who are developing receive access to the same supports as newcomers  so that they may choose to access these       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           96      as needed.   D. We do not have long-term ELLS in the school.   E. Former ELLs who are in Dual Language classrooms are now considered part of the English speaking group of students. They  are provided with the same 50/50 instruction in both English and Spanish, so they are constantly engaging in both languages  even as they pass the NYSESLAT. Former ELLs in ENL classess get 90 minutes/week push in instructions by ENL teachers.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Some of the instructional strategies include cooperative learning, posting support charts, picture supports, and partner work  so students can have access to academic content. All resources are provided in both languages. There is at least one para- professional in each grade.  Ms. Perri checks RSPE from ATS to see if children with IEP gets all mandated services  accordingly.  Students are provided with Reading Rescue and AIS. In addition, they are offered After School and Saturday  School to catch them up on any instructional gaps that they may have.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  SETSS is provided to students through programming that mirrors what students do in the classroom at the time that they are  pulled away for SETSS instruction. Teachers share plans through Google Docs so that all teachers servicing the students are  working from the same curriculum plans. The SETSS teacher provides scaffolds so students can best access the content.  Also,  they are provided with afterschool programs, RTI or reading recovery to support their literacy or math skills. Classrooms with  IEPs may include a para to support learners.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  We have the following targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA and Math:  Reading Recovery: The Reading Recovery teacher, who is also the ESL Teacher, provides ELL students who are reading at a level  1 with services. She is trainining through New York University and learning about reading recovery strategies to support ELLs.  There are four 1st grade ELLs in Phase I of the program. This program is offered in English.     Response to Intervention (RtI): RtI is offered to ELLs performing at Level 1 and Level 2 through small group and 1 to 1  instruction within the classroom on a daily basis. Teachers take a group of 5 students in the classroom for 20 minutes intervals  to focus on Guided Reading five days a week. The focus is on students who are reading in at least a level 2 (DRA) or above. This  program is offered in both English and Spanish, depending on the native language of the student. ESL Students receive  instruction in English.     Fundations: This phonics program helps students to improve their reading fluency and word decoding skills. This program is  offered to students in Dual Language classrooms on English language designated days. ESL students receive instruction in  Fundations for 30 minutes, daily in English. Though all students are targeted, groups are formed according to proficiency levels  in the program.     Estrellita: This Spanish phonics program helps students to improve their reading fluency and word decoding skills. This  program is offered to students in Duial Language classrooms in grades K-2 in Spanish on Spanish language designated days.  This program targets all students, though it is differentiated by levels.                     2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           97      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Summer program, after school program and Title III enrichment program will be planned to improve students' English. Below  are the trends from the last exams in 2016-17:     Math: 19% level 3 and 4  ELA: 25% level 3 and 4  NYSESLAT:   56% of students with comparison scores from previous year grew 1 or more levels.   38% of students with comparison scores from previous year showed no growth.  6% of students with comparison scores from previous year went down 1 level.  28% of students had no data from the previous year to compare to (as they were new to the country)       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   It is not anticipated that we will need to discontinue any current services until additional data is collected and reviewed for  efficacy.      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  We ensure that there is equity to access for all parents and children. Starting with our parents, we ensure that all material that  is sent to the home is available in two languages. Translation and interpretation is available by a range of PS 311 staff. Almost  everyone on staff can communicate in Spanish, the dominant language spoken by students and their families.  Parent Orientation and Open school night was presented to students and families in both English and Spanish. In addition, all  presentation materials and events are offered in both English and Spanish. Parents feel welcome and informed as a result. We  welcome parents' questions and provide information to support their children. In addition, students are offered all services as  English proficient students. This includes Extended Day, after-school programming three days per week on Tuesdays,  Wednesdays, and Thursdays; and after school programs offered by New Settlement.     Academic after-school is offered from October thru June. This is open to all students in Grades 2-5. Students focus on Close  Reading and an intensive math concept two days per week. The program runs 2:30-4:30 on Wednesdays and Thursdays.     Students at Level 1 receive a third day of after school thru Practice Makes Perfect. They will focus on a math concept one day  per week. Fridays, 2:30-4:45.     Saturday School is offered to students per week. Students who do not pass a math exit ticket on Tuesday are invited to the  next Saturday School where the math exit ticket will be reviewed in depth. Saturday School runs from October thru June, 8:30- 12:00.        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  All classrooms are equipped with Smartboards, a laptop, and an iPad to use for instruction with students. In addition, we have  purchased 55 iPads to use with students through School Improvement Grant funds. Students will learn using applications that  we purchase. Additional materials purchased to support students is Reading A-Z, Fountas & Pinnell Leveled Library Kits,  Fundations (phonics in English), and Estrellita (phonics in Spanish). Our Science teachers utilize FOSS kits to engage students in  science experiments.       13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Home language support is provided through each Dual Language teacher in the classroom. Native language arts, and  instruction in the content areas is delivered in this way. Native language library collections are housed in each Dual Language       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           98      classroom, in the school's library, and in the Literacy Room. Teachers of students in ESL programs are able to support the  native language of their students by borrowing books for their students on an as-needed basis from the Literacy Room.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    As the basis for differentiation, each ELL student receives the required number of minutes of ELL instruction according to LAP  guidelines, represented in the preceding charts. Teachers collect and analyze data from NYSESLAT, NYS ELA Performance  Tasks, Math Performance Tasks, MoSL, and DRA reading assessments to further differentiate instruction. Additional  information taken from classroom observations, conference notes, and other qualitative data is looked at to make decisions  that correspond to developmental levels of students according to age and grade. All data is gleaned through the lens of  attainment of Common Core Learning Standards. All curriculum is aligned to the NYS CCLS.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    N/A     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   For students, there was a pre-enrollment period in the spring that allowed us to promote our new Dual Language based  school. Parents were informed about the services that would be provided to all students, the mission and vision, and curricular  plans. The DOE supported efforts of new schools in securing preliminary spaces for students who planned to enroll at PS 311.  In the Summer, the ELL Coordinator met with parents who pre-registered students to assist them in enrollment.      In July 2017, parents were invited for a celebration and open house to learn about the school, meet newly hired teachers of  ELLs, and to receive a free uniform for the school year. Parents were encouraged to become active members of the community  and to celebrate the spirit of the school, which includes cultural understanding.       At the start of the first day of school all school personnel, met and greeted children and parents in the school yard. This  procedure has continued, as all teachers and the Principal are present at line up and dismissal.  Newly enrolled students are  paired with a buddy to ensure that the student is welcomed and becomes familiar with the campus, routines, practices, and  key staff at the school.           17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    As we are currently a K-5 school, the electives offered to ELLs constitute being in a Dual Language program where they learn in  English or Spanish, rather than an ESL setting where students learn only in English.      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?      A. In the 80:20 Kindergarten Dual Language program, students receive Math, Social Studies, Science, Art,  and Gym instruction in English sequientially. They receive Science and Social Studies five times per week  (alternating weeks), delivered by one Cluster and the Classroom Teacher. Students receive Music &       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           99         Movement twice a week and gym twice per week. The model is a self-contained model. In the Grades 1-5  classrooms, students follow a 50/50 Dual Language program, roller coaster model that changes languages  every two days. Students have PE and Music & Movement in English. Social Studies and Science are in  both languages throughout the week.      B. In Kindergarten, the ELA and part of the math content areas are taught sequentially in Spanish. The  math , Social Science, and Science are taught in English. The PE and Music & Movement programs are  taught in English. In Grade 1 through 4 we use a roller coaster, self-contained model for our Dual  Language classrooms. Students receive Social Studies, Science, Music & Movement and Gym instruction  in English and Spanish (in the case of Science and Social Studies). Students receive Science and Social  Studies five times per week (alternating weeks focusing on one content area). ELA and math are taught in  both languages, alternating every two days.     C. Language for instruction is divided as noted above in Section A and B.     D. The Dual Language model we use in Grade K is self-contained 80:20. In Grade 1, we have two Dual  Language classrooms that are self-contained, whereby the teacher changes languages every other day  (For example, Monday and Tuesday instruction is in English, Wednesday and Thursday instruction is in  Spanish, and so forth.). In addition, we have an ICT, self-contained Dual Language classroom in Grade 4  and 5. Teachers also use  the "roller-coaster" model, alternating languages based on the day designated.      E. In Kindergarten, emergent literacy is taught in Spanish. In Grade 1 and 2, emergent literacy is taught in  both languages.          Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The Professional Development plan for all teachers include: Developing Objectives that  are aligned to the Common Core Standards, Developing and using assessments that inform whether students have met their  objective, Depth of Knowledge, and Questioning. In relation to teachers of ELLs, these school-wide PD goals will have an added  lens of how to think about these 4 areas of development relative to ELLs. For example, when thinking about objectives,  teachers of ELLs will also receive PD on developing content and language objectives for students. All PD activities will relate to  the four opver-arching PD goals. In addition, PD will include curriculum mapping, ELL stratagies, labsites/intervisitations, and  policies and procedures.

All PD will  include a lens regarding supporting ELLs in attaining Common Core standards. In particular, Questioning, Objectives, and  Assessment are directly related to this goal.        2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  As we are currently a K-5 school, this is a topic that we have begun to address as a school community. We will make  partnerships with district and local schools so that they can come and present their school to our parents and to answer any  enrollment related questions. The Parent Coordinator will also plan trips to take parents to visit some of these schools.   Teachers will be offered PD that will allow them to target 15% of total hours for all teachers and 50% of total hours for  bilingual education/ENL Teachers  (10 hours for special education teachers) for all staff, as per requirements of CR Part 154.2.  Topics will be related to the four priority areas listed above. In addition, teachers will be offered PD related to learning about  strategies for supporting ELLs, setting language objectives, and how to differentiate instruction. PD will be offered across the  year.         Teachers of ELLs will meet the required 50% ELL-specific PD through the Monday PDs, twice per month. Records of agendas,  sign-ins are kept in a PD binder in the Principal's Office.            2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                            102      Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   PS 311 has a high degree of parent involvement on the part of parents of ELLs. This is attributed to the majority of the staff ,  Assistant Principal, and Principal being dominant in both English and Spanish. Parents have expressed that they feel welcome  due to presentations translated for them, the warm welcome they receive, and because all staff members meet and dismissal  students--giving parents the opportunity to speak with teachers. In our 2016-17 Quality Review, it was noted that our parent  communication and involvement is rated as "Well-Developed".      Parents are contacted individually through the Tuesday parent meeting times to provide parents with an opportunity to  discuss the goals of the program, specific to their own child as well as data pertaining to their student. The Bilingual  Coordinator and classroom teacher are part of this discussion, alongside administrators, as needed.      We have our staff, Bilingual teachers and also Parent Coordinator who translates or communicate with parents in Spanish  directly.      The Annual Parent One-On-One occurs in the beginning of the year. Parents make their selections about their programs for the  new year. The goals of each program are discussed, along with NYSESLAT progress. Parents are provided with data about  language needs.       2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Lucero Elementary School has a high level of ELL parent engagement. Activities that foster parental involvement include the  following: Weekly Parent Meetings focusing on academics (i.e. ELL related topics, ELA, Math, Motivating students to Learn),  Parent Volunteerism in the Classroom through our PEEPS program in collaboration with New Settlement, Monthly Movie  Night, October  Harvest Festival, Activity Night, Abbott House (programs for mental and emotional health and wellness), Cook  Shop for parents, Edible Garden cooking labs for parents, Wellness in the Schools cooking labs for parents. Newsletters are  also provided in both languages to inform parents of the school events, as well as monthly calendars printed in both  languages.     The majority of parents who participated are families of ELLs, as we have a high ELL population.     Translation is provided.               Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.            2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                            105                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Lucero Elementary School                                                                              School DBN: 09X311  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

Data collected from the students Emergency Contact cards.      Primarily, we have 303 Spanish speaking families, 147 English speaking, 1 family that speaks Fulani. All of our  materials are translated and provided in English and Spanish. For the Fulani family we use the Language Line and  translate for them the information we are willing to give to them.   To support families where there may be illiteracy, we use posters with symbols for identifying the purpose of  meetings. Our fliers include these symbols, as well.    During school meetings such as Parent Teachers Conference, School Leadership Team meeting, Breakfast with the  Principal, Parent Workshops and IEP meetings translation will be provided for parents through the use of school  staff who are proficient in Spanish.

Translated versions of this document will be obtained through the  DOEs website (  (http://schools.nyc.gov/RulesPolicies/ParentBillofRights/Parents+Bill+of+Rights+and+Responsiblities.htm.)      We will post a sign in the school building in a conspicuous location near the primary entrance in each of the covered  languages, indicating the availability of interpretation services.           2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                            110      Our school’s safety plan will contain procedures for ensuring that parents in need of language access services are not  prevented from reaching the school’s administrative offices solely due to language barriers. We have spoken to  security and they know to contact our school when one of our families visits. We are well acquainted with all of our  foreign language speaking families, and they know how to direct themselves to our Main Offices once they sign in  with security.       As we have less than 10% of students who speak a language other than English or Spanish, we going to use the  Language Line and use DOE translation in order to have a good communication with them.       Our website shall provide information in each of the covered languages concerning the rights of parents to translation  and interpretation services and how to access such services.           Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       We will gather feedback from parents on the quality and availability of services through parent surveys conducted  through a paper and focus group survey. This is done at the end of each meeting.    In order for them to feel welcome at our school we speak with the families that speak foreign language during  dismissal times about their school needs.             2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                            111
