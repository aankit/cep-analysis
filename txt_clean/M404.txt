This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      Innovation Diploma Plus High School will ensure that both the educational and developmental needs of each student  will be served. Our goal is for every graduate to be an authentic learner with the analytical and social skills needed to  excel in our ever-changing world and truly become a citizen of the information age.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Innovation Diploma Plus (IDP) is a small transfer high school designed to support the social, cultural, emotional and  academic development of over-aged and under-credited students. Together we serve students who are looking for an  opportunity to experience success, earn their high school diplomas, transition to college/careers and reach their  dreams. IDP values the wealth of creativity, honesty, courage, and hopefulness our youth and their families bring. We  know that when they come to IDP, they are making a commitment to honor generations of struggle for the promise of  education and success in life. IDP is an alternative in the best sense of the word. Its role is to transform our students’  learning experience from what they’ve been told they can’t be, to what we know they can and will be.   IDP's staff is committed to each student, and we will invest in their success. We will work with each student to provide  the following:   ● School culture that promotes student leadership and strong engagement   ● Support from a primary contact person who will conduct regular one on one check-ins on the student’s progress   ● Support in tracking their academic progress using report cards, progress reports, and periodic assessments   ● Attendance outreach, academic intervention and counseling services   ● College preparation, job shadowing and other career preparation, and mentoring opportunities   ● Referrals to community based support services for students and family members   ● Accelerated credit accumulation   ● Student-centered, rigorous classroom instruction   ● Portfolio development and workshop model instruction   ● Paid Internships through the Learning to Work (LTW) program      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   At IDP, many of our students have tried traditional high schools, but couldn't find a support system and environment  where they could thrive. Our main priority, as a Transfer High School, is to serve over-aged and under-credited  students and re-engage this population of students towards post-secondary success.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Our greatest strides during the 2017-2018 school year were in the elements (of the Framework for Great Schools) of  Collaborative Teachers and Rigorous Instruction. We developed structures for collaboration between teachers in the  school with an emphasis on building authentic real-world learning experiences that emphasizes the analysis of  complex text through a lens of argumentative thinking and writing. Through our year-long professional learning  calendar we engaged in cycles of collaborative Inquiry connected to three key focus areas: 1) The Design of Authentic   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Tasks; 2) The Implementation of Authentic Tasks; 3) The Analysis & Revision of Authentic Tasks. Teachers met  frequently throughout the year to monitor and evaluate progress through ongoing tracking, and revising plans as  needed in response to student learning trends. Additionally, Inquiry Leaders worked with the principal to plan for and  facilitate professional learning sessions throughout the school year. Under the element of Rigorous instruction, we  continued our second year, in a three year journey, as part of the Transfer School Institute (TSI) with a focus on  strengthening our teacher's instructional design practice emphasizing the design and implementation of higher order  project-based units of study, aligned to CCLS 1 and 2 Argumentative Writing each trimester.   For the 2018-2019 school year we will continue to prioritize Rigorous Instruction, as we further develop and expand  our instructional focus in order to consistently engage all students in argumentative thinking and writing across all  content areas, using common language and literacy based instructional strategies. As a PLC we will engage in the  design of cognitively challenging and project based tasks that infuse a range of strategies and interventions from the  Innovation Diploma Plus Literacy Handbook. We will continue to build, revise, and adjust our handbook as we monitor  and measure student growth through Inquiry. A key target area across all classrooms will be for all students to  demonstrate the key habits for gathering and sourcing evidence in order to develop cogent arguments in discussion,  which will then transfer to stronger writing in literacy and math, and develop the communication and collaboration  skills that support college and career readiness.    2018-2019 will also bring an increased focus towards building Strong Family-Community Ties. At IDP we have a  strategic partnership with the Community Based Organization, Allianza-Catholic Charities in which we are working to  build a college-going culture for our scholars and their care-givers in order to leverage both the academic and college  and career readiness skills needed to be successful in today's global economy.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 03M404   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   188   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     During the 2017-2018 school year, all of our major disciplines worked collaboratively on building authentic learning   tasks in order to close the student engagement gap through real world learning experiences aligned to the 21st  century   skills of: communication, collaboration, and creativity. Our theory of action was: IF teachers design tasks that provide  students    with creative, authentic, relevant and challenging learning experiences, THEN student engagement and ultimately    student achievement will increase.       Per the 2018 School Quality Guide Survey, the Innovation Diploma Plus Community received a score of 3.14 with  regards to   Rigorous Instruction, which is 0.24% below the citywide average.      The overall pass rate for ELA Common Core exam for SY 17 was 53% with a total of 88 students sitting for the    exam. Of the 88 students that sat for the exam a total of 22 students (25%) had a score of 75% or higher.      The overall pass rate for the Algebra Common Core exam for SY 16 was 33% with a total of 62   students sitting for the exam. Of the 62 students that sat for the exam a total of 12 students (19%) earned a   score of 70% or higher.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13         Per the Regents data, classroom observation data, student work analysis, and diagnostic data -- we see an   Increased need to focus on infusing literacy practices and the mathematical habits of mind across classrooms.      Additionally, based on classroom observations and school evaluations their is an increased need to engage teachers in  a more    systemic approach to professional development to support the development, execution and analysis of authentic  learning    experiences that are both rigorous and relevant.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  Per the NYC Department of Education’s annual attendance report IDP’s year to date attendance for the 2017-2018  school year was approximately 68.5%. This did not exceed our SY 17 goal of reaching a 3% gain from the previous  school year (68%). in an effort to reach our attendance goal we will continue to strengthen our work as a team by  increasing our YTD attendance by 3%.      Of the 53 Transfer High Schools in the city -- Innovation Diploma Plus ended the 2017-2018 school year with the 16th  highest attendance rate.   As noted on the 2017-2018 School Survey 92% of families say that they feel well-informed by the communications  they receive from their school, as compared to the Borough and City average which is 94%.      Per the Quality Review (2015-2016) report under the item: "How clearly are high expectations communicated to  students and staff?" our school school received a rating of Well Developed.      Our data shows that students who attend school 65% of time -- receive 80% of the credits attempted. Based on our  analysis we see a direct correlation between improved attendance and academic achievement.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  By June of 2019, there will be a 3% increase in our whole school attendance, as measured by the NYC Department of  Education’s annual attendance report.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          18     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.  Strategies to address the needs of students with  disabilities, English language learners, and other high- need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited,  SIFE, STH).   The IDP attendance team will meet on a weekly basis to review  attendance data, discuss school-wide attendance goals,  brainstorm initiatives and problem solve around chronic  absenteeism.      As part of this work, school-wide attendance challenges, after  school clubs, and incentive programs will be implemented  throughout the year to engage students in the community and  increase daily attendance.   The learning community will work together in Advisory Teams to  utilize data tools (Skedula, New Vision's Heat Map, ATS, & CASS)  to identify patterns of of chronic absenteeism and examine the  factors affecting why students are missing school. This data will  be used to create a tiered priority list for student outreach (Tier  1: 75% attendance or Better; Tier 2: 50%--75% attendance; Tier  3: Less than 50% Attendance).   For students whose attendance does not improve, the principal,  assistant principal, advocate counselor(s) and attendance  teacher will hold face-to-face meetings with the student and a  parent or guardian to lay out expectations and get signatures on  an improvement plan.   Per the UFT contract, IDP teachers have time built into their  schedule (every Tuesday) in order to make phone calls and hold  strategic action planning sessions around chronic absences. Each  staff member will identify 6 students that they will follow as an  “Attendance Buddy” throughout the year. Attendance Buddies  will provide targeted outreach to ensure that all students have a  strong connection with at least one adult in the community.           3b – Parent and Family Engagement   Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Based on data from our year-long observation cycles, as well as feedback from the 2017-2018 Principal Observation  (PPO) process – our teachers need increased support in designing rigorous and relevant units of study that place an  increased emphasis on depth of questioning, student discussion, and the use of varied writing activities, in order to  enrich and promote students’ participation and their development of critical thinking skills.       Per a curriculum map audit conducted in May of 2018, using the Rubicon Atlas Curriculum Map Rubric, we found that  50% of the curriculum maps, for core disciplines, met or exceeded (3 or 4 on rubric) expectations for higher order  authentic tasks.   Per the 2018, School Quality Guide Survey the Innovation Diploma Plus Community received a score of 3.91 with  regards to Collaborative Teachers, which exceeds the citywide average by 0.27%.       Per the 2015-2016 Quality Review report our school received a Well Developed with regards to QR Indicator 4.2 - How  well do teachers work with each other.    Through collaborative Inquiry our teacher teams determined that we need to further develop units of study that  employ the use of formative assessments and checks for understanding that allow consistent analysis of student work  in order to make daily curricular decisions to meet students’ learning needs.      Per summative feedback from the Principal Performance Review process our community needs to strengthen the  development of curriculum, to ensure that instructional shifts are strategically integrated across subjects to support  student acquisition of key skills. Additionally, we need to build teacher capacity in questioning and discussion  techniques so that students routinely engage in student to student discussions that reflect high levels of student  thinking and participation.

Our Inquiry Leaders will meet weekly to  review the professional development plan and discuss "Glows" "Grows" and "Next Steps" for their teams.  Additionally, through this work we will continue on the path of developing a school-wide Literacy Handbook that  memorializes our literacy best practices and authentic performance tasks for each discipline.      Teams will meet every Monday to engage in Inquiry and the analysis of student work with regards to meeting  Common Core reading, speaking and listening, and writing standards. Additionally, teachers will utilize common  planning time to meet with their departmental teams in order to improve pedagogical practices and work with our  job embedded professional development consultants to design Common Core aligned units of study and performance  tasks. We will also utilize formal and informal observations to provide our teachers with feedback with an emphasis  on improving teacher practice. At the onset of each trimester, each teacher submits an Individual Learning Plan (ILP,)  aligned to the Danielson Framework, in which they target an area of improvement for that trimester. These plans are  reviewed and updated throughout the year and progress towards meeting these goals are measured through  classroom observations, Regents data and scholarship reports.

During these meetings, teachers utilize the formative assessment results in order to drive  the development of summative tasks and to assess student progress towards achieving mastery objectives. After data  is collected teachers then meet to dissect and analyze the results in order to reflect on the appropriateness of the task  and how it can be improved for future implementation. Professional Development is provided throughout the year  with an emphasis on teachers working in both departmental and interdisciplinary Inquiry Teams with a focus on  assessing and analyzing student growth (performance tasks, Regents, and summative exams).        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42     to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievment.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Innovation Diploma Plus, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A  of the Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a Parent  Involvement Policy (PIP) to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and  the families. the school's policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and  decision-making in support of the education of their children.         Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Innovation Diploma Plus will support parents and families of Title I students by:        providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level,   e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology;     providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and      decision making in support of the education of their children;  fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress;     providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;     sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and  in languages that parents can understand;     providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and  other members of the school community.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The Innovation Diploma Plus Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs  of all care-givers in the IDP community, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with  disabilities. The school community conducts an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent  involvement policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation  through school surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of  parents, and enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.          Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent  Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.    Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, Innovation Diploma Plus will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  All students that enter the Innovation Diploma Plus community go through a comprehensive intake process in which ELL  students are given a baseline (teacher made) assessment. The data from this baseline allows us to strategically program our  ELL students and measure growth. The data has revealed that our ELL students need targeted support in both reading  comprehension and writing stamina, especially with regards to writing longer research papers and argumentative essays.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Students are programmed based on their required ELL needs. Additionally, our ENL teacher works in collaboration with  content area teachers during Common Planning Time to build individualized learning plans, based on the data, for our ELL  students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51         3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Students are given a baseline English and Mathematics Regents to identify baseline areas of need and progress at the outset of  each trimester. Trimester 1 serves as the baseline; whereas, Trimester 2 & 3 are used to monitor progress.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once students are identified to receive academic intervention, per summative assessment analysis, a plan is made in  collaboration with the student, ENL teacher, content area teacher, and advocate counselor to identify entry points for  additional support. Some of those additional supports include: after school support, Saturday boot camps and, pull-out on a  case-by-case basis.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Over the past 5-years our ELL students have progressed  with the majority of students advancing to the next level or testing  out of ESL. The data clearly shows that our ELLS are more adept at speaking and listening than reading and writing.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Teachers meet everyday during 7th period for Common Planning Time in which they meet either in departments or  interdisciplinary teams to engage in data dialogues and intervention planning.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Innovation Diploma Plus High School (IDP) uses a national small high school instructional model   (heterogeneous) designed to support the social, cultural, emotional and academic development of over-aged and  under-credited students. IDP currently provides ESL students with a free-standing ENL program with instruction  provided in English. The program of study is aligned with New York State’s ESL and ELA curriculum and reflects the  states’ learning standards through instructional practices and proper use of acceptable learning materials, such as a  variety of leveled texts.    Classes include English Language Arts instruction with extra assistance from our ENL teacher who pushes-in two  periods a week.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Presently we have 1 ESL student. In order to meet compliance standards, students receive standalone ESL instruction during  our Academic Intervention sessions and during 0 period, (daily) 56 minutes of ELA instruction, and (daily) 56 minutes of  instruction in Global History (using the push-in model-ESL and Content area teacher co-teaching). Since we only have 1 ESL  students, we are not required to offer Native Language Arts Classes.       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   All of our students take at least 56 minutes of ELA and Social Studies every day that is aligned to the Common Core Standards  and focuses on preparing students for college and careers beyond high school. We have consistent literacy practices that are  infused into all classrooms (e.g Accountable Talk, Annotation, etc.) and our Inquiry Teams meet on a weekly basis to assess  and analyze student progress towards meeting standards, with a special lens towards the language objectives that are built  into summative Common Core aligned tasks. Students are required to engage in the writing and reading process everyday at  IDP, and all of our courses ask students to participate in class discussions (face-to-face and online) and make oral  presentations.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   Within the national small high school instructional model used by the school, content area instruction is delivered in English to  heterogeneous groups of students (no more than 25 in a class) using the following instructional elements: Competency based  and standards aligned instruction, student-centered instruction, whereby the material is consciously and relevantly explained  and connected to students’ experiences, cultures, interests, backgrounds, and abilities, and whole-school teaching and  learning strategies, such as infusing literacy across all content areas, the workshop model, project  based  learning, interdisciplinary thematic units, and common approaches to career and college readiness.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Instruction is differentiated based on student proficiency of content area competencies identified within each content area.  Within such a model multiple exit and entry points are identified for the needs of ESL students and used within the completion  of authentic assessments that demonstrate mastery of content areas. In addition, students with ESL needs are given access to  language glossaries, online resources (e.g text to speech) and allowed extended time in completing assignments.       6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   ELL students at IDP are given the opportunity to complete class requirements using our Diploma Plus competency and  portfolio based assessment system. This allows the students to collaborate and produce a presentation or project that reflects  the material being learned in each academic class. Mobile laptop carts in each classroom allow for our ELL students to access  language acquisition online resources and produce work that is professional and research-based. In each content area students  teachers incorporate common literacy practices using the Workshop Model. Students are given access to classroom libraries  that are categorized by level of proficiency. These libraries will continue to be upgraded as our school focuses on the needs of  our ELL students. Students are provided access to language dictionaries when appropriate and receive modifications of text as  necessary.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  This subgroup of our school population will be given opportunities for additional language support during lunch, after school  and before school during our academic intervention services program which runs prior to the being of the school day. . Lessons  are aligned with state standards and consist of activities that foster both social and academic growth. Language functions,  structures, usage and vocabulary are part of each lesson. Additionally our flexible programming model allows for our ELL  students to be fully integrated into all courses offered at IDP.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Innovation Diploma Plus High School uses a national small high school instructional model (heterogeneous) designed to  support the social, cultural, emotional and academic development of over-aged and under-credited students. We currently  utilize a push-in collaborative team teaching model, which involves direct support for our ENL students. Our Academic  Intervention Model utilizes a tiered approach to best support the individual learning needs of each student. We also provide  indirect support through weekly collaborative meetings with individual teachers to identify and gauge student needs and  progress. Through those conversations individual action plans are created for the students that include literacy and  numeracy interventions (English, Math, Science, Social Studies) through classroom instruction aligned to our push-in model.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Due to funding, we had to discontinue our Achieve 300 subscription. We would like to renew that license in order to use  Achieve 3000 to perform a baseline assessment for our ELL students. We will then use that data to develop a customized  program to monitor student growth. Achieve 3000 will also be used to support content area teachers in providing students  with additional resources such as, leveled non fiction texts. With this in mind, students will gain support in meeting content  objectives while developing language acquisition skills.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All of the ELL students have access to and are fully participating in the general education curriculum with appropriate ELL  support. Innovation currently does not have students listed as in need of extended services. Our plan is to address these  students with specific academic and social support. ELL students in need of extended services are formally invited through the  LAP team, and will be provided with individual counseling from our guidance staff and one-on-one tutorial assistance from  both the ELL Coordinator, as well as an English teacher during after school hours.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  All of our content area teachers utilize tiered reading materials and embedded texts. Teachers are also encouraged to develop  language objectives and activities aligned to those activities. Teachers in Social Studies and Math also utilize extended learning  opportunities via the online learning management systems Schoology and Fuel Education.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Parents of our ELL students are kept up-to-date on student progress via anecdotals on our Student Information System,  Skedula. Additionally, our ELL Coordinator is in constant contact with the parents keeping them abreast of their child's  progress.        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    As a result of our push-in model, our teachers meet consistently with our ENL teacher to align classroom materials, review  language objectives and discuss individual student needs and action plans. Our AIS support, collaborative meetings and online  resources work in conjunction to support each or our ELL's needs, as appropriate to age and grade level.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    For the 2017-2018 school year our ENL teacher will also be serving students for 1 period at Frank McCourt High School. There  is a campus wide theatre program that meets on a weekly basis, and we encourage our ELL students to participate in this  program, as it as fantastic opportunity to collaborate with students from across the campus and engage in fun team-building  activities, while also preparing for 3 campus performances throughout the school year..     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Each newly enrolled student goes through an orientation process in which they participate in team building activities and  baseline literacy and mathematics assessments. All of our content area teachers utilize tiered reading materials and embedded  texts. Teachers are also encouraged to develop language objectives and activities aligned to those activities. Teachers in Social  Studies and Math also utilize extended learning opportunities via the online learning management systems Schoology and Fuel  Education. Additionally, students who are transitioning into our school for the first time will receive additional supports from  their advocate counselors, ENL teacher, and social worker.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    N/A     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Our professional development calendar is geared towards supporting all teachers in infusing literacy strategies into all content  areas. As a school, we are aligning all content to the Common Core with an emphasis on building student stamina to  deconstruct complex, Non Fiction text. Through New Vision's our ENL teacher, as well as the teacher of ELLS (English/Social  Studies), are provided with year-long professional development support through monthly ELL meetings. As a member of the  New Vision's Affinity Group our teachers who provide services to our ELL population are provided with numerous PD  opportunities throughout the school year to keep them up-to-date on the most cutting edge ELL teaching strategies.       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.    We are currently supporting our ENL teacher in attending ELL Professional Development offered outside of the  building.  Additionally, we are presenting the concepts of the Diploma Plus Model and best scaffolding techniques to all our  teachers. During the school year all staff will be exposed to ESL best practices to incorporate in the development and delivery   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55         of instruction. In addition to the skills staff have developed from in house PD, staff members will have the opportunity to  participate trainings offered through the Boro Field Support Centers to further develop skills to support our ELL  population.  When training is offered our ENL teacher will receive the required amount of professional development and all  other staff will continue to receive professional development on differentiation for ELL/SWDs .All professional development  supports are logged by our New Vision's coaches and records are maintained by the school secretary.          Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   At Innovation we believe that parent involvement is critical to student success. At the outset of the school year our ENL  teacher sets up individual meetings with all of the parents or guardians of ELL students to discuss the goals of our program.  Additionally, to help incorporate parents in our school culture the Parent Coordinator and our School Leadership Team are  working together to publish a monthly newsletter. This newsletter will be translated into Spanish and will provide parents,  students and staff with pertinent school information, volunteer opportunities, dates of parent meetings, dates of after school  activities and will highlight student achievement. Our parent coordinator will hold monthly parent meetings with translators  present (as needed), and all school letters will be accessible to the parents in multiple languages. Based on this parent choice  and the number of English Language Learners, IDP currently provides only a freestanding ESL program. This has been the trend  since our first year and is aligned with both parent and student request. This admissions conference will also provide an  opportunity for the ENL teacher to disseminate a copy of the Language Allocation Policy to all our ELL families.      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   As part of our school’s admission team and will review the parent survey form and program selection form during the  student’s first interview. At this interview, the ESL program, LAP policy and the orientation materials will be presented to the  parents and student. The conference will discuss the varying types of services provided to ELL students such as Dual Language  Instruction, Bilingual Education Programs and Freestanding ESL programs. Parents will be given the choice of picking a program  that best serves their child’s need. This will be reinforced in the form of letters that are provided to each parent of an incoming  student. Letters will be provided to parents in their native language as well. A one-on one interview with the ENL teacher and  native language translator will assure both parent and student comprehension. Numerous resources are provided to parents  during the first Parent Association meeting of each semester and speaks about methodologies that will assist children in  English learning. During our orientation process parents and students engage in an informal conversation by the admissions  committee. The conversation is conducted in English unless native language support is necessary. If home language is not  clearly identified as English, trained staff then administer the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) which is available in  nine different languages. Staff members who speak the native language of the student assist in this process.  Some of the  specific activities that we include at our school include: English Classes for parents and Art Therapy for ELL students and their  parents.             Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Dan Storchan, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Innovation Diploma Plus                                                                              School DBN: 03M404  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Upon gaining admission to Innovation Diploma Plus all students go through a rigorous orientation process. As part  of that process we meet with all parents or guardians of potential students. Through the interview process we are  able to gain and track important data about the translation and interpretation needs of our parents. That data is  logged in a shared spreadsheet , as well as in ATS and on each student information card, and is kept up to date  through the support of our on-site CBO, Allianza Dominicana and our Attendance Coordinator. Additionally,  Innovation Diploma Plus High School identifies the primary language spoken by the parent of each student upon  enrollment. This information is kept on file, maintained in ATS and recorded on the child’s emergency contact  card. Spanish is typically the only language that we will need translation and interpretation services for. We have  translated many of our school letters into Spanish and make use of in- house translators for telephone calls and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      conferences. The Translation and Interpretation unit will assist us in translating any additional information as  needed.              2.
