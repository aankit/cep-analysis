This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The school’s mission statement is as follows: Millennium High School provides a rigorous liberal arts academic  program. We prepare students for a college of choice and empower them through the setting and reaching of goals.  We believe in teacher leadership and provide and extensive professional development program based on content,  pedagogy, youth development, and advisement.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   Millennium High School, as a screened program, draws students who have demonstrated industry and investment in  their education long before their first day in high school. Working with this population has obvious rewards but also  presents distinct responsibilities. In terms of students’ individual experiences, the school needs to continually present  appropriate, and appropriately varied, tasks to ensure that each pupil continues to develop skills and content  knowledge. That has required a continuing discussion about rigor – in terms of both high school work and the work  students can expect in the undergraduate setting. The second responsibility has been to purposefully measure  student progress given their historical, and enduring, performance on state measures (both in terms of passing and  degree of passing). That has led to a continuing discussion about assessment – including class and department  measures and the use of those assessment tools.      The pre-eminent special initiative currently underway is the continued practice of the school’s Exhibition, an extended  independent research project for seniors. Seniors work directly with a content-area teacher to identify a topic, pursue  related research, craft an 8-10 page argumentative paper, and then present their work to an audience of teachers and  peers.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   In terms of special student populations, the primary challenge in the 2018-2019 school year is continuing to  appropriately serve and support students with disabilities. Our current full-time ICT population includes students who  need additional supports in ELA and Mathematics, which we are addressing in small-group SETSS instruction and  after-school academic support.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The element of the Framework for Great Schools in which the school made the most progress last year was 5D  (Effective School Leadership), through ongoing planning meetings between administrators (both principal and  assistant principal) and teachers. The data sources for that progress included classroom observation of the  participating teachers as well as debriefs of those observations. Additional evidence of progress was represented in  course-specific documents (including rubrics, lesson and unit plans, and student-facing materials). The key areas of  focus for the 2018-2019 school year include elements 5A, 5B, and 5C.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 02M418   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   666   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     1. The school strength in regard to this Framework element is that departments have engaged in yearly reflection  around rigorous department-specific instruction, as documented in meeting notes and evidence from our Quality  Review, PPOs, and self-reflection. Recent work during the 2017-2018 school year has included identifying and refining  department skills and related expectations for exit-level (i.e. senior year) competency.    2. The priority need is to revisit, refine, and target specific discipline-area skills, including determining related exit  levels of performance for each grade level. School-level observation and discussion indicate that the school needs to  address student skill development through both vertical alignment (within discipline) and horizontal alignment (across  disciplines). The data sources include informal and formal observation through Advance, departmental and  administrator review of curriculum maps, and interdisciplinary conversations as part of inter-visitation.           Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   1. The school's strength relative to this Framework element is that all returning teachers will continue to teach the  same courses as they did during the 2017-2018 school year, and thus have recent and relevant evidence to inform  interdisciplinary planning. That status is based on staff assignments, student programming, and current courseloads.   2. The priority need for the 2018-2019 school year is to resume regular grade team meetings with a particular focus  on shared examination of student work. While teachers work together in a variety of teams (planning, department,  advisory), feedback from staff (direct and through school-based and the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 NYC school  surveys) indicates a continued and shared need for collaboration by teachers of the same grades. Administrative  examination of planning team (e.g. Algebra I, Global 9, Biology 9) review of student work, as documented in  department spreadsheets for 2016-2017 and 2017-2018, indicate that teacher observations and related instructional  adjustment have impacted course practice but not grade-level practice. That conclusion has been supported by  informal and formal observation through Advance.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   1. The school's strengths relative to this framework include exisiting structures for whole-school initiatives as well as  individualized coaching and planning support by administration. During the 2017-2018 school year the principal met  with four teachers (from Advanced Placement Biology, Advanced Placement Chemistry, World Literature, and Health).  These conversations informed course-specific instruction, promoted alignment of coursework with CCLS, and helped  define rigor for both lower (9th and 10th) and upper (11th and 12th) house classes.   2. In 2018-2019 our academic offerings include continuing courses taught for the first time (British Literature,  Environmental Studies, Health) as well as courses under continued review (Mandarin). Teachers of these specific  stand-alone courses do not have on- or off-site planning partners. The priority need is to address and support these  teachers, building off of the coaching conversations of the last three years. Systematic school-level observation of  teachers (through Advance) has revealed that those without a formal planning partner (teaching the same course)  have limited opportunity and reduced accountability to review and refine lesson and unit plans.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  By June 2019 the principal and the assistant principal will each have met weekly with at least three (3) teachers who do  not have planning partners, as measured by an improvement in teacher practice in Domain I of Danielson's Framework  for teaching.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          21     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional  development, and/or systems and structures needed  to impact change.

Include  the  timeline and identify key personnel responsible for implementation and oversight.  Administrators will use planning meetings with participating teachers to inform outreach to parents around course,  content-area, and grade-level priorities. The school will offer dedicated first semester parent workshops around the  transition to high school (primarily for ninth grade students), test preparation (for all grade levels), and project work  (for all grade levels) to inform and empower parents about school academic practice. Those workshops will  complement ongoing forums for parents like curriculum night, parent-teacher conferences, and School Leadership  Team meetings.         Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment  Part 4a. Indicate resources you will leverage to achieve this annual goal and implement this action plan, including  human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc.  This action plan will require dedicated meeting times that have been added to teacher and adminstrator schedules. In  addition to those schedule adjustments, teacher per session and per diem funding may be used to allow participating  teachers to observe peers and conduct off-site classroom visits. Human and instructional resources, as represented by  current staff and school-specific course materials, will be employed as appropriate to inform and guide participating  teachers.     Part 4b.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   As of the 2017-2018 school year, approximately 40% of students come from households where either Mandarin or  Cantonese are spoken. Attendance at Parent-Teacher Conferences and school-specific workshops (including those  staged by the Parents' Association), as well as the NYC School Survey and school-specific interviews, indicate a need  for increased outreach to and inclusion of those parents and caregivers.    1. The strength of the school relative to this Framework element is the addition of a bilingual parent coordinator as  well as bilingual teaching staff.    2. The priority need is to increase target language outreach to, and inclusion of, Mandarin- and Cantonese-speaking  parents.

N/A        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Column B   Verify with an (X)   Section Reference(s)   Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local                                                  1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          32     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Millennium High School is responsible for creating and implementing a parent  involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the  families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision- making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School  Leadership Team and Parent Association as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      Millennium High School will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent-related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s overall program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Parent Involvement Policy, parent members of the school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Parent  Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input. To increase and improve parent  involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s  Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team and the  Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association). This includes providing technical support and ongoing  professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, School Quality Guide and Snapshot, Quality Review Report, Learning  Environment Survey Report.;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;             2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:         ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association);   ● establishing a shared resource with instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress, including written and verbal translation appropriate to caregivers' language of record;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;            School-Parent Compact (SPC)   Millennium High School is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of  student achievement between the school and the families. Staff and parents of students agree that this Compact  outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for improved academic  achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure that all children  achieve State Standards on assessments.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  We use teacher-created assessments across core disciplines to assess both reading and writing ability.  Assessments include  both take-home and on-demand (timed in school) tasks.  The data reflects content awareness and understanding (particularly  in mathematics) as well as L2 struggles with comprehension, written expression, and content-specific vocabulary.  The data  helps inform the school's instructional plan across core subjects (English, History, Math, and Science) for ELLs.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Teachers use shared planning time to regularly review student work, including examination of ELL-specific concerns.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41         3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Student progress is evaluated based on school-specific assessments, including regular course work and diagnostic measures  that do not impact students' grades.  Student development of listening and speaking competency is assessed through class  participation as well as targeted individualized measures.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Content-area teachers and special education teachers routinely share student data and evidence with the ENL teacher to  inform instruction.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A       6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Student performance on NYSESLAT and grade-appropriate Regents exams are used to evaluate and inform ELL instruction.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Student performance on Regents exams is discussed among content teachers, the ENL teacher, and as appropriate, special  education teachers to determine necessary adjustments.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   All 9th and 10th grade students take 5 periods of English Literature, 5 periods of History, 5 periods of Math, 5 periods  of Science and 4 periods of Foreign Language per week.  All 11th and 12th grade students take the same core courses  but can choose courses within the content that are more in-depth. For example, we offer Advanced Chemistry,,  Physics, Advanced Physics, 4 levels of Spanish, 3 levels of Mandarin, British Literature, Dramatic Literature, Economics,  Government, U.S. Survey, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, Calculus and Applied Math. Students need 53 credits for  graduation.  ELL students are served through this core curriculum as teachers receive a significant amount of  professional development regarding literacy across the curricula.  Skills are sequenced throughout the 4 grades, and  students receive instruction on core skills in 9th grade and build on these skills over the next 3 years.  A strong  emphasis on reading and writing ensures that ELL students are served within this curriculum.     Due to the low number (approximately 1%) of ELL’s in our program, most students receive services through a  combination of free-standing ENL classes as well as in their regular academic classes and after-school support.    A  licensed ESL teacher uses ENL strategies in school-day and after-school support sessions, and shares concerns and  strategies with general education teachers,.  Students identified as having special needs work directly with our five  special education teachers (including SETTs classes in place of foreign language classes during 9th and 10th  grade).  Most ELL’s are expected to pass the NYSESLAT at the end of their first year at Millennium (in most cases, their  9  th   grade).      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42         ELL students have mandated small group instruction during the after-school program and support with Advisory will  continue to be the way we support students in need of transitional support.     Presently, we have no SIFE students.  Long-term ELLS will be mandated to attend after-school small group instruction  with the ELL certified teacher.  Students achieving proficiency and needing transitional support will be assessed in  conversational, reading and writing skills through the advisory program.  Advisors will look at the individual student’s  productivity across the disciplines and determine a plan of action based on performance and feedback from the  student.  Students identified as having special needs work closely with our five special educators.         b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A     2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              Dedicated ENL time is provided on a weekly basis, and students are also provided with small-group academic support  from their ELA teachers.   ENL, ELA, and content-area support are provided according to student's proficiency level and  demonstrated needs as determined by ongoing assessment.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      Core content is addressed directly in English as part of ENL/ELA instruction.  Instructional approaches include both ENL and  content-specific strategies, so that students are engaged in CCLS-aligned work commensurate with their English language  competency.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      As noted earlier, staff use student interviews and home language work samples when possible (in Mandarin and  Spanish).   For students who have other home languages, interviews and evaluations require the use of the Department of  Education translators.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Differentiation of instruction includes, but is not limited to, alternative texts and source material; modified rubrics for  speaking, reading, and writing tasks; and extended process for major projects and assessments (including additional process  drafts and staff feedback).   Newcomer and developing ELLs receive the most consideration in terms of differentiated  instruction and assessment, including extended time for testing and consideration for home language Regents.  Long-term ELLs  and SIFE students receive instruction and accommodations commensurate with their individual needs and abilities.  Former  ELLs receive continued support in all four modalities, particularly in written and spoken English, as part of their core curriculum  instruction.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43      ELL-SWDs are provided with small group content instruction, including pull-out pre- and post-teaching on specific units, in  addition to their IEP mandates and ENL services.  Materials used for subgroups include modified texts or English language texts  appropriate to students' individual levels of language ability, as well as emphasis on communicative tasks that promote  student-to-student use of content-specific language.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  ELL-SWDs are scheduled for small-group and individual instruction to minimize time out of their co-taught classes.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Targeted intervention for ELLs in specific content areas is provided through after-school support on an as-needed  basis.  Intervention services, conducted in English, include small group and one-on-one instruction for all disciplines as part of  the school's overall academic support.      ENL strategies and techniques are used by content-area teachers as well as our ENL certified teacher.     Approaches to teaching literacy to ELLs are similar to those for teaching literacy across the board in that they focus on reading,  writing and conversational skills.  Instruction throughout the school is based on balanced literacy and includes explicit skills  instruction, shared/guided reading, use of cooperative learning groups, and both graphic organizers and manipulatives.     All former ELLs receive language support for two years after reaching proficiency on the NYSESLAT.  These students receive the  mandated ELL modifications when taking predictive, interim and state assessments.  These students are also encouraged to  attend after-school enrichment programs and are also given bilingual glossaries and other native language materials  (dictionaries, etc.) to use in their mainstream classes.      Our LAP team sees success in that our ELL students are given significant support in the school and therefore are finding success  in all classes. We have discussed plans and policies for one-on-one ENL instruction after school as part of regularly scheduled  academic support.  We have learned that our students have an opportunity to succeed at our school even if they are tested as  ELL.  Specific actions will include improving our one-on-one ELL instruction after school and creating more conversationally  based instruction at that time.  Support needed is an ELL specialist assigned to our school to work with our students, if and  when ELL enrollment increases, and to provide teachers professional development in areas of ELL training.     Native language and cultures are evidenced throughout the school in all curricula.  Teachers attend professional development  workshops and participate in conversations to address incorporation of primary documents into their curricula, promoting  incorporation of documents that are native to a specific place.     ELLs may pursue study of Spanish and Mandarin in full-year language classes.  As noted earlier, four and three,  resprectively,levels of proficiency are offered for both languages.         9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Given our current population (ELLs with IEPs), we will continue to coordinate ENL instruction in accordance with ICT and small- group content area support.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44         ELLs are expressly included in all school programs, including course offerings, Advisory programs, and after-school academic  and club activities.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Materials used for subgroups include modified texts or English language texts appropriate to students' individual levels of  language ability.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   For ENL, home language support includes assessment of home language ability (across all four modalities) and, as needed,  instructional and assessment materials provided in home language (most notably Regents exams).     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.   Services and resources are provided in accordance with ELLs abilities, but are also designed to provide age- and grade- appropriate challenges.  While the language is geared to the appropriate proficiency level, the concepts, content, and  challenges are framed for high school students.  Materials used for subgroups include modified texts or English language texts  appropriate to students' individual levels of language ability.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    N/A     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   In addition to ELL determination, new ELLs are offered support for transitional concerns from their student advisor, guidance  counselors, and the parent coordinator.  Those activities include individualized orientations and meetings between school staff  and ELL students.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    The same as for all students, Spanish and Mandarin.      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Professional development for teachers of ELLs includes grade team and department training in assessment and instruction on  an ongoing basis.  Teachers discuss individual ENL/ELL needs in department discussions, which happen a minimum of once a  month through our SBO Professional Development plan.   Guidance Counselors, the Parent Coordinator, the school secretary  and school aides address ELL issues as part of PPC and weekly communication efforts.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45         The ENL teacher meets with ELA teachers to discuss CCLS, addressing communicative, course and state-level assessment  expectations.    Staff discuss social-emotional and academic concerns for ELLs as part of ongoing Advisory team meetings.    Records for all sessions described above (including Grade Team, Department, Advisory Team, and PPC meetings) are  maintained by school administrators.          2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  See above.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   The school conducts individual family meetings to discuss ENL/ELL progress to date and goals.  For ELL-SWDs, those meetings  are in addition to IEP meetings although they may be held on the same day.  Translation for parents and guardians is provided  by staff members (in Spanish and Mandarin) and through the Department of Education's translation and interpretation unit.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   ELL parent involvement is proportional to the ELL population.  Individualized and general outreach (written, electronic, and  phone) to parents of ELLs is addressed by student advisors, administrators, case managers (for ELL-SWDs) and our parent  coordinator.           Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Colin McEvoy, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Millennium High School                                                                              School DBN: 02M418  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Initial determination of language preferences for individual households is based directly on ATS reports, and is  then updated by information from HLIS, ATS, Emergency Contact references, and school-based surveys. We  provide written translation in our summer letter to parents in Chinese and Spanish informing them that we have  translation services available if they would like to send us written information in their native language. We reply  back in the native language after translating our responses to any letters received. All school-sourced  communication is provided in translated form consistent with records for each family's preferred language. We  also send letters to parents informing them (in Chinese and Spanish) that we will have interpreters available to  assist during parent teacher conferences. Additionally, we translate as many school-specific references, such as  the parent newsletter, parent handbook, and any other documents requested by the parents of ESL students.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49     2.
