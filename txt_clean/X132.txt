This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      Our mission is to engage children in learning that prepares them to be productive global citizens by ensuring they are  reflective in their thinking and published works, critical thinkers, effective communicators, proficient in all subject  areas, and strong in character.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   Garrett A Morgan is a barrier-free elementary school with 400 diverse students from pre-kindergarten through grade  5. We are located in one of the poorest congressional districts in the nation and serve a high-poverty community.  Despite these obstacles, we consistently make tremendous academic progress with our varied student populations.    The vision of Public School 132 is to create a community of children to be competitors in a global society who will  ultimately have a profound impact on the world. We are committed to exposing children to the nuances of the  techno-world and embedding it into their daily learning so that it will have a positive effect on their academic and  social growth. This commitment will provide them with the necessary foundation to be successful in their future  academic endeavors.   This is accomplished through our partnership with New York University and Columbia School of Social Work, that  provide additional social worker interns that help and support our climate and culture to ensure that the social- emotional environment is attended to. This allows us to provide all children with the best possible educational setting  and ultimately impact student achievement. Student achievement is also impacted through the use of technology.  Every classroom has at least two computers, Promethean ACTIV Board, and shares an ELMO. All fourth and fifth grade  classrooms have document camera smart boards. We have a full service MAC lab with smart board technology, three  iPad carts, and three mobile laptop carts available for use. A technology club was created for students who have  expressed an interest or demonstrated outstanding ability in technology. This club, “The Spotlight Tech Squad”, trains  students to troubleshoot, become videographers, and edit videos and audio sound bites which will ultimately assist in  providing them with the technological skills needed in the global workforce. Our students that are performing at the  higher end of the learning spectrum are invited to join the BOOST club, and once a week, in addition to their daily  class assignments, are afforded the opportunity to extend their learning through the media-arts.    To ensure that we are developing the whole child we provide the following:      Arts Instruction includes the following: Reader’s Theater, modern and cultural dance, and visual arts..     Healthy Living includes the following: CookShop, Healthy snack initiative, healthy eating choices and recipe   instruction to educate students' palates, and physical education classes. With a NYS grant we are able to  provide students with an afternoon snack of fresh fruits or vegetables twice a week.  Sports Programs includes the following: CHAMPS BOKS and flagfootbal; Basketball and Cheerleading teams  that compete competitively.       Our instructional practices have been most influenced by the work and research of Charlotte Danielson (Evaluation  Rubric), Fountas & Pinnell, Ruth Culham’s (6+1 Traits of Writing), Norman Webb (Depth of Knowledge), LCI (Learning  Center Initiative), and UDL (Universal Design for Learning).   The work and research is embedded throughout units of study, daily lessons, assessments, teacher & student support  resources/tools, observations including feedback provided to teams and teachers, and professional learning.   The Danielson framework provides specific criteria regarding instructional practices. The research has influenced how  we engage in conversations with teachers and teams, and given us descriptive and common language used in the  development of teacher learning which has directly impacted student learning and progress. Before the  implementation of the rubrics, for teacher development, it was important for our learning community to become   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      familiar with the ideas and language of the rubrics, which have been used in providing feedback, both orally and in  writing.   Married with the Danielson framework is the Chancellor's Framework for Great Schools that encourages parents,  educators, school communities, and external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and  increase learning opportunities. This collaborative focus ensures that every child is consistently ready for the next  grade, level, and set of challenges. Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas  that each school must improve to accomplish high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what  it takes for schools to function well, the Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and  weaknesses of a school and shows community members concrete ways to improve. The key area of focus for this year  and the one we as a school community have made the most progress is rigorous instruction. It is defined as the  following: Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core.  High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and  developing critical thinking skills. To that end our beliefs are as follows:    Our Beliefs of How Students Learn Best and How We Define Rigor: Teacher Practice and Student Engagement   o Planning with students at center, differentiation (making smart decisions, when, where & how)   o Communicating purpose, “why” they are learning what they are learning: student awareness of goals/objectives  and learning targets.   o Student understanding the purpose of their learning/tasks   o Student centered: Student-to-student interaction, teacher as facilitator   o Making connections, building on/developing prior knowledge   o Student engaged in conversations, questioning, and reflection: protocol, criteria, rubrics evident.   o Use of clear criteria, exemplars, rubrics. Consistent checking for understanding techniques, assessment throughout  units, culminating assessment tasks (aligned to teaching and CCLS).   o Feedback provided by teacher and peers that communicate grows(off target) and glows(on target) as well as next  steps with a reflection.    o Creative, engaging, relevant tasks that allow for hands-on experiences, use of tools, and manipulatives.   o Explicit, clear modeling: Scaffolding strategies, guided practice, small group instruction.   o Use of exemplars, models, and/or a mentor text   o CCLS integration   o Planning for essential and guiding questions   o Use of teacher questioning, anticipating student responses/moves and planning accordingly    o Evidence of Blooms and DOK, scaffolding and differentiating questioning    o Small group instruction, flexible grouping   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      o Conferring   o Building vocabulary through tiers (everyday, academic, content/domain specific)   o Celebrating student work/projects: Teaching practices leverage use of data, inquiry, strategies, questioning, and  discussions that promote higher levels of thinking.   o To extend our Global Learning we embed four of the United Nations 17 sustainable goals into our curriculum. Upon  completion of the study students are engaged in a service learning project directed at meeting the sustainable goal.    Ensuring Instruction for All Students: Knowledge of students   o Teachers supplement and revise units based on whole class, small group, and individual student needs – this is  evident in unit and daily lesson plans.   o Multiple entry points: Supplemental texts/resources, choice in process and product.   o Use of data to make decisions, adjust lessons, create flexible groups, identify conference next steps, including  student sub-groups.    Engagement Strategies Evident in Classroom Practice.   o Student discussion protocol’s and discussions built into units/lessons.   o Student to student discussions and questioning.   o Development of guided questions throughout unit and lessons.   o Task cards, criteria, rubrics used to support individual and groups of students .   As we continue to strive to create conscience global citizens, we have implemented a Recycling Program to further  assist in the New York City’s Going Green Initiative and a Healthy Eating Initiative to address the rising childhood  obesity and asthma percentage in our community.         3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   ELLs need assistance with writing and speaking. SWDs require targeted strategies that allow them to access and  engage with high level texts.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     During our recent Quality Review (2016-2017) the reviewer found that our curriculum is aligned to Common Core  Learning Standards (CCLS), content standards, and our mathematical practices and integrate the instructional shifts.  Additional findings included our purposeful decision making to build on standards by noting the development of the  standard from one grade to the next. Pacing calendars and lesson plans emphasize critical thinking skills across grades  and subjects and for ELLs and students with disabilities. As evidenced by the Quality Review, there are common  planning templates used to plan lessons across grades and subjects which contain the teaching point, CCLS,  vocabulary being addressed, essential questions, key ideas, the Danielson Framework connection, small group and  independent work, teacher modeling, differentiation support for tier one, two and three learners, reflection and  connection, and some type of exit ticket or culminating activity. There is a detailed pacing calendar that highlights the  standard and focus by grade across subject areas with considerations for unpacking standards by grade. For example,  the school examined the CCLS reading standards for informational text and determining the main idea of a text and  explaining the main idea from kindergarten through fifth grade as well as the learning needed at each particular grade  level. This standard analysis tool is incorporated into plans and is helping to build coherence within and across grades  and subjects. The review revealed that across classrooms student engagement, including thinking and participation, is  inconsistent. Teacher practices demonstrate uneven applications of multiple entry points and extensions for ELLs and  students with disabilities.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   By June 2019, all teachers will consistently provide scaffolds and multiple entry points to the curricula so all students can  independently engage with the curricula as evidenced by the feedback in formal and informal observations.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15   Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  Our most recent Quality Review (2016-2017) indicated that the school provides regularly structured times for  teachers to meet and plan based on the school’s instructional focus and to improve their pedagogical practices in  teaching reading. Teacher assignments and student grouping supports all students especially English Language  Learners (ELLs) and students with disabilities.. It also stated that the school has invested human and monetary  resources, above and beyond what is offered by the City, to support the training of paraprofessionals to provide  additional reading intervention and support to targeted students. On a daily basis, paraprofessionals pull out  individual students previously identified by teachers to provide phonics, phonemic awareness, fluency, vocabulary,  and comprehension support through the Reading Rescue program. As a result students’ reading levels have gone up  at least two to three levels since the baseline assessment was administered. More students are able to read and  grapple with grade level appropriate text since they have strategies to help them resolve reading difficulties and be  able to read fluently and comprehend text at an independent level. The reviewer also found that school leaders  consistently communicate high expectations to staff through various communication tools and then provide support  to achieve expectations while holding them accountable. Parents partner with the school so parents are able to play a  role in their child’s academic life.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment.

The findings from the most recent Quality Review (2016-2017) are as follows: Teams analyze various assessment data  for groups of students, particularly the ten students they are responsible for, to improve staff and student  achievement. Teachers initiate and execute ideas and decisions that help to improve student learning. Teacher  leadership structures are put in place so teachers have opportunities to experience leadership capacity within the  school and can make decisions accordingly. School leaders designed a role and responsibility posting for grade level  leaders, and teachers are able to volunteer to fill such posts in collaboration with other teachers. Teachers on the  team monitor the timeliness and effectiveness of the grade leader and have the opportunity to make changes to  support their efficiency and efficacy as a team to improve student learning. As a result, teachers are seeing  improvement in student progress and are incorporating more effective teaching strategies into their daily routines.

Our most recent Quality Review revealed that  the curricula-aligned assessments and rubrics provide actionable feedback to students and teachers. Common  assessments are used by teachers to monitor students’ progress toward goals and make instructional modifications. The school leader and other school administrators are implementing the school’s observation plan and providing  timely on-going evidence based actionable feedback to staff. The school leader and other school administrators use  an informal schedule for observing.

The school leader in collaboration with school staff has developed a plan to ensure that classroom teachers and  guidance staff understand how to create and sustain family engagement. The school will continue the process from  the 2017-2018 school year which helped school staff develop partnerships with families. In addition to the  aforementioned, the 2016-2017 Quality Review cited that communication with families is consistent and on a regular  basis. Families receive information through face-to-face conversations, emails, telephone calls, and progress reports.  Parents receive information that helps them support their children at home and while in school. During the parent  meeting, one parent said, “If we see something, we have to say something about the educational programs whether  good or bad, if we feel it will help our child in the end.” As a result, parents visit classrooms to learn more about the  CCLS and attend workshops to help improve their understanding of the work students are doing. Parents have access  to online reading resources including books from the NYC Public Library that support the school’s efforts in building  effective reading habits at home. In addition, ENL classes for parents help parents acquire the language skills they  need to better support their child’s learning of complex materials. One parent shared and others agreed that all of the  school’s efforts supports them and gives them hope that their children can one day attend an Ivy League school like  Harvard University.

Our school maintains year-long relationships with our feeder pre-schools. The relationship ranges from school and  classroom visits to parent meetings. Our pre-schools provide us with critical information so we can continue meeting  the needs of families and their children. This includes having pre-school students and families meet with our school- based support team.        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Teachers on the MOSL team have worked collaboratively to determine the selection of appropriate multiple  assessment measures, professional development has been provided to the entire staff. Once the selections are made,  teacher teams administer baseline assessments that inform their teaching practices. Teachers then begin to analyze  student work to make certain the implemented teaching practices are translating into student work and ultimately  having a positive impact on student achievement. To make good use of the collaborative knowledge of the team,  teachers work collaboratively to create grade-wide assessments with help from the instructional coaches.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36        Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. 09X132, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       The Garrett A. Morgan Elementary School will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability  grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report,  Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Elementary and Secondary Education (ESSA) Act;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between /teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Our school uses Fountas and Pinnell to assess all our students in English Language Arts. Teachers plan the literacy block based  on the results for their own students, using the data to differentiate instruction based on students' English Language  Proficiency. In all grades, instruction is aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards and ensures that students have  repeated opportunities to access and use language in all subject areas. Our students in the self-contained monolingual classes  receive push-in services provided by a licensed ESL teacher.  Our school invites our students to Title III after school program  (Grades 3-5), which will emphasize vocabulary development through content areas, as vocabulary is critical to reading, writing,  and speaking proficiency.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The Fountas and Pinnell running record system is administered five times a year to all of our ELL students.  After each  administration, teachers analyze the data to form an action plan to address the language and literacy needs of their students.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50         3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We analyze the data from the state tests for Math, ELA, and Science to assess the progress of our ELLs. We also examine the  NYSESLAT results. We look for improvements in the four modalities and analyze progress based on the strands in each  assessment.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Based on their data analysis, teachers develop an action plan to meet the needs of their students.  This may entail small group  instruction or even one to one instruction.  Teachers used standard based materials to monitor student progress and develop  next steps for the students.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Our school uses Fountas & Pinnell, benchmark assessments, and classroom based assessments to provide data to identify and  target students in need of intervention. Teachers continue to work with students until they show adequate progress in the  targeted skills. Tier 2 interventions in K-5 are put into place and paraprofessionals work with students who continue to  struggle in identified skills. Tier 3 intervention is provided by the SETTS teacher. Our Entering and Emerging ELLs receive 1 unit  of study in ENL/ELA per week. Our Transitioning students receive 0.5 units of study in ENL or content area instruction, and our  Expanding students receive 1 unit of study in ENL or a content area per week.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Entering students who took the NYSITELL examination revealed that all newcomers lacked English language skills and were  placed in a Free Standing ENL program. The NYSESLAT exam was administered in May so data is not available at this time. Our  students traditionally struggle to meet the reading/writing modality in the NYSESLAT. During the Spring NYSESLAT examination  some of our ELLs achieved proficiency, while others showed improvement and advanced to the next level of proficiency. Our  long term ELLs remained   stagnant.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   This information is disseminated during teacher team meetings, grade meetings and professional development.  Teachers are  able to revise, modify curriculum, units, lessons as needed to meet the needs of their students.            Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Every grade has a cluster ENL class.  The ENL teacher pushes into these classes and integrates instruction with the  classroom teacher for 180 minutes and delivers stand alone instruction for 180 minutes.  Students with IEPs are also  serviced the same way by the ENL teacher pushing into the class and integrating instruction for 180 minutes and  delivering stand alone instruction for 180 minutes.     b.

DL program.  If applicable.      N/A     2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              The ENL teachers are scheduled to push in for a minimum of 360 minutes to deliver 1 unit of stand alone and 1 unit of  integrated ENL instruction in all ENL cluster classes as well as in the self contained classrooms with ENL students with IEPs.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      All content is delivered in English only being that Freestanding ESL is the program that we have in our school.  Visuals,  vocabulary reinforcement and strategies, as well as close reading are used to meet the demands of the Common Core Learning  Standards.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      Conferencing, formative assessment, Fountas and Pinnell assessments, teacher observations and running records provide  teachers with data assessing ELLs academic progress.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Differentiated Instruction:  Teachers use assessments in order to create differentiated instructional groups throughout the school day for all of our  students. Students may be grouped by ability, interest, learning style, or language proficiency for particular tasks.  SIFE: Most SIFE lack academic proficiency in their native lanuage as well as in the content areas. These students are identified  by the ENL coordinator at the time of enrollment. Although our SIFE do not have IEPs, teachers know that they will need extra  support in order to catch up to their peers in Spanish and English. Teachers differentiate instruction in order to support these  students' needs. Spanish teachers reinforce vocbulary development and writing mechhanics in their native language. English  teachers use modeling  to scaffold instruction. Manipulatives are very useful during content area instruction such as math and  science in order to provide visual and tactile support, as well as create opportunities for language usuage.  Newcomers: Newcomers are usually addressed by the same services provided to the SIFE students.Teachers assess their prior  knowledge and they receive support during the literacy and math periods according to their needs. Newcomers benefit from  direct instruction, modeling, instruction with their peers and small group learning. As they are welcomed into the classroom,  theh teacher may be assigned a "buddy" or group of "buddies" to help the newcomer learn the class routines and adapt to the  school culture.  ELLs receiving services for  4-6 years: These students benefit from our reading program. The ELA curriculum we have focuses  on Science and Social Studies standards-based topics. Units are consistent across the grades to allow for deep exploration of  each topic and a true foundation of content area knowledge. In addition, students read materials that provide them with  access to high-interest books at their own level in English and Spanish. Teachers frequently assess using running records  (Fountas and Pinnell) and comprehension questions in order to identify their needs. They also benefit from having proficient  peers in their heterogeneous classes who model laguage use.  We do not have any Long Term ELLs at this time. But, if we did, they would benefit from our reading program as well utilizing  the reading materials, as it allows them to select high-interest books on their reading levels.  Former ELLs are serviced for an additional two additional years from when they were tested out. These students continue to  be apart of programs such as: Title III, which is offered at different ELL levels ( beginners, intermediate, and advance groups by   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      grade levels); ELA and Math after-school programs which help students improve their reading, writing, and mathematical  skills.        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   To make the content more comprehensible and to enrich the language development, we use ESL methodologies based on the  SIOP model, TPR-total physical response, and CCLS.Teachers front-load background knowledge, use explicit vocabulary  instruction, teaching Latin roots and base words, prefixes and   suffixes, and cognates. Teachers carefully scaffold texts and engage students in paired and small group accountable talk.  Students use graphic organizers and strategy charts, and process charts to write paragraphs. Accountable talk prompts are  used to support academic discussion and peer evaluation of work using rubrics.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  The ELL's/SWD that are identified as in need of related services receive them as prescribed by their individualized Educational  Plan (IEP). An action plan is prescribed, diagnosed, and monitored. The plan is adjusted as needed based on age, needs, and  proficiency levels. Teachers are using homogeneous proficiency groups within their ELA literacy period. Teachers are  encouraged to attend workshops for teachers in ENL and Special Education classes. Small group instruction in Special  Education classes 12:1 are provided.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Our school offers ELL Morning Academy for students in K-5 in English. Phonics, Phonemic Awareness, Fluency, Vocabulary, and  Comprehension instruction is targeted in English. We also offer Scholar Academy for students K-5 in English.  ELA and Math are  the core subjects that are targeted.  Saturday Academy is also offered in English.  ELA and Math are also the core subjects that  are targeted.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Next year we will continue to fully expand our technology supports and Wilson/Fundations program to support our ELLs. In  addition, we will continue to improve our current programs.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   None      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All ELLs are afforded equal access to after school programs. They participate in all school programs and activities in a  heterogeneous environment.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Our classrooms are equipped with Promethean ACTIV Boards, SMART Boards, ELMOS<  and digital projectors to facilitate the  instructional process.  Graphic organizers and explicit vocabulary instruction are used to support the needs of this population.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Our ESL cluster classes and ELL students receive integrated instruction with embedded ESL methodologies using the SIOP  model. Teacher are encouraged to label their classrooms using both English and dominant home language. Students are also  paired with peers who speak their home language if necessary.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         The ELLs'/SWD that are identified as in need of related services receive them as prescribed by their individualized Educational  Plan (IEP). Students that do not have an IEP are reviewed by the RTI (Response to Intervention) Team. An action plan is  prescribed, diagnosed, and monitored. Students are placed in the appropriate grade/setting according to their date of birth  and grades, students are placed in a class specifically designated for students learning English as a new language. Students are  also grouped and receive services according to the same criteria above.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    N/A     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   The Garrett A.
