This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   We Believe students learn best when they are immersed in an active, student centered, and visually dynamic and  creative learning environment. As a TEAM we are creating a Learning Community to foster people’s commitment and  capacity to learn at all levels.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    As a high performing college preparatory high school (97% Graduation Rate-August 2018) we provide students with  an array of challenging and enriching academic programs (STEM Based Labs, Robotics, Computer Coding, Advanced  Placement Courses, Adobe Photoshop, College Courses) that will prepare them to be reflective readers, thoughtful  writers, and strong critical thinkers. Given the dynamic size of our school community (600+ Students), the teachers  and staff have the opportunity to work collaboratively and personally with all students.      Our emphasis on critical differentiated reading (Achieve3000), writing (Common Core Argumentative Tasks), critical  thinking (QFT, FLSA, Rigor Mining), and creative artistic expression (AP Art, Photo-Shop, Lincoln Center Partnership)  fosters the skills our students need to achieve their future goals. All students are expected to meet the New York  State Standards, Common Core Regents requirements, graduate with an Advanced Regents Diploma, and take either  an AP or College Level course prior to graduation.       We are very committed to providing our students with numerous post-secondary college skills and experiences by  offering Advanced Placement (AP) courses to encourage students to push their thinking so they will be prepared for  college. To foster equity by tenth grade any student who is interested in taking an AP course may apply. For 2018- 2019, we are offering the following AP courses: World History, US History, Psychology, English Literature, Art,  Computer Science Principles, Spanish, Macroeconomics (Total-8). Over the years we have been honored to have  students receive AP Scholar Awards and a Scholar Award of Distinction from the College Board for their performance  on the AP exams.       As a College preparatory high school we are also committed to providing our students with viable college level course  work and experience through our college partnership programs with Plaza College, and dual credit programs linked to  Medgar Evers College and University of Albany.       At Goddard students come first. We are very intentional in creating a student centered learning environment where  all students feel engaged and challenged. We achieve this by equipping our classrooms with a variety of dynamic  technology (3D Printer, MacBook Pros, Photoshop, Digital Elmo Projectors, Digital Assessment Clickers, and MacBook  Printing Stations). Our Digital Art Studio and STEM Science Lab also affords students with the opportunity to generate  powerfully expressive and compelling projects, such as building and operating self-created robots and working on real  world research projects for our Science Fair.      As an institution of higher learning we also believe very strongly in offering students dynamic enrichment activities to  strengthen their Emotional Quotient (EQ). To achieve this we provide students with a variety of programs such Chess,  Cheerleading, Yearbook, Debate, World Cultural Club, Technology Club, Advanced Robotics, Student Government,  National Honor Society, etc. We also offer the following competitive sports program for athletes through the PSAL:  Boy’s Basketball, Boy’s Soccer, Boy’s Baseball, Girl’s Softball, Girl's Basketball, Girl’s Soccer, and Co-Ed Cricket.       Promoting a positive school culture is also an essential goal at Goddard High School. Therefore, we provide students  with numerous opportunities for them to grow socially and intellectually by participating in the following school-wide   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      events: Talent Show, Art Gallery Exhibit, School Theatre Productions, Multi-Cultural Expo, College Alumni Panel  Discussions, Fall Festival, College Trips, International Trips, Career Day, Internship Workshops, Spirit Week and Field  Day activities.         3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   At Goddard High School we also work hard to meet the needs of all of our students especially our ELL and Special  Needs students. At Goddard we offer among other models ICT, and ELL integrated and stand alone services. We assist  all of our students, with the following strategies:  Differentiated assignments  Extra help before, after and during  school  Summer tutoring for regents exam prep  Vocabulary Instruction in class via Lexile Array Strategies   Instruction on the writing process and integration of tier II and III words in academic writing  Direct instruction in  writing argumentative essays and expository essays  Writing scaffolds for the writing process (outlines, templates,  sentence starters, etc.  Socratic seminar to generate engaging discussions  Stations, video, audio clips and web- based activities to create student-centered learning  and Achieve3000 support aligned to student lexile levels.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   On the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide we saw the greatest increase in "Collaborative Teachers" and "Effective  School Leadership". Our key area of focus for 2018-2019 is Rigorous Instruction.

We will create  strategies to assist teachers in planning anticipatory and higher  order questions in their lesson plans for station/rotation groups;  allowing students to explain their thinking/modelling for their  peers, and ensuring that lesson plans have rigorous learning  tasks and questions that encourage students to make deeper  connections between texts and the real world. PD will be  structured bi-monthly. On Mondays/Tuesdays, teachers will  meet in departments to data mine the FLSA and quarterlies.  Teachers will also meet on Mondays/Tuesdays to use the Lesson  Plan Protocol (LPP) to revise and create rigorous student tasks to  address the gaps that are gleaned from the data mining. During  the LPP teachers will use a protocol that requires teachers to  share a lesson and receive feedback on the lesson through the  lens of rigor. Teachers will help one another to use WEBB Align  to evaluate the lesson to measure and increase the rigor in the  lesson. In addition, each department will run a PD where they  will share a best practice that highlights rigor in questioning,  discussion and task creation. Departments use specific literature  circles as hands on sessions where teachers assume the role of  their students and learn best assessment practices, question and  task formation and effective stations/rotations or Socratic  Seminar activities.      In addition, teachers will observe one another teaching these  lessons created during the LPP as a way to share best practices.  Teachers will partake in a minimum of two inter-visitations this  school year. The first will be in the fall and they will observe a  teacher within their department with the lens of rigor of  questioning and tasks. The second inter-visitation will be done  with a teacher from outside of their content area but who  teaches on the same grade level with the same lens.

What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  Strengths   Source: 2017-2018 School Quality Guide-School Conditions and Practices:   97% of teachers say that adults at their school tell their students they believe they can achieve high academic  standards. (Q21b)   92% of teachers say that adults at their school help students develop the skills they need to complete challenging  coursework despite obstacles. (Q21a)   86% of teachers say that adults at their school teach critical thinking skills to students. (Q21c)   In an effort to prepare all students for college and careers and to support student critical thinking skills we use  Achieve 3000 to strengthen student literacy skills and to raise their lexile level so they can be college and career  ready. Students take a pre (level set) and a post (level set) at the beginning and end of the year. Level set in  September determines students reading levels. Achieve 3000 provides differentiated non-fiction Informational texts  geared to each student's lexile level. Lexile gain increase is linked to frequency of completed activities, i.e., minimum  of 40+ activities o a maximum of 80+ activities. For students to see gains they must also consistency score in the high  80's to raise their lexile score.    In support of the current emphasis on College and Career Readiness we have tracked student preparedness for  college and careers based on their current lexile reading levels.    In the Fall of 2016, the initial readiness forecast showed that 27% of students were meeting or exceeding their  reading level.    By the Spring of 2017 data indicated current preparedness for college and career readiness at 43% (59% increase).    Spring 2018 data shows an increase in the number of students (44%) who meet or exceed the college and career  readiness category. Achieve 3000 data indicates the following in terms of numbers of students who completed 40 or  more activities and those who completed 80 or more activities. Trends indicate that Grades 11 and 12 need to be  specifically targeted for 40+ and 80+ activities (See Below).   40+ Activities 80+ Activities   9th: 154/171 9th: 142/171   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          18      10th: 114/171 10th: 114/171   11th: 36/115 11th: 2/115   12th: 8/79 12th: 1/79        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment.

Students will complete a  minimum of 40/80 activities throughout the school year.  Students can increase 15 points per month if they receive  88% or 100% on their multiple-choice activities. If they  receive 75% on all activities they receive credit but do not  move levels. At the end of each month the Lexile levels are  adjusted. At the end of each marking period students  receive a quiz grade based on whether or not they have  increased the average amount of points. If students  increased 15 points per month over the marking period  they receive a score of 100%.    Students each month record their Lexile level on a handout.  They also have a career that they have chosen and they  know the Lexile level required to attain that career.

They have the opportunity to participate in professional  development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement.      Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Strengths:   Teachers are encouraged to align their lessons to the Blue Print for Success Template and to prepare effective  motivations that excite students and draw them into the content being presented. Teachers utilize various discourse  strategies that engage and challenge students such as: Turn & Talks, Socratic Seminars, Gallery Walks, Debates, and  Jigsaws to promote opportunities for students to make their thinking observable in student-to-student discussions.   Teachers also use modeling in order to effectively support students in producing higher level work products, and to  promote depth of learning. Teachers achieve this through the use of rubrics to assess student work products and  through providing actionable feedback   2017-2018-PPO feedback indicated that we should continue strengthening teachers by:   A) Providing professional learning sessions and/or coaching to strengthen lesson planning, questioning and discussion  techniques, and increased cognitive engagement; B) Incorporate strategies such as including anticipatory and higher  order questions in lesson plans for station/rotation groups.; C) Permit time for students to explain their  thinking/modelling for their peers; D) To increase critical thinking skills and engagement ensure that lesson plans have  learning tasks that encourage students to make deeper connections between text and real world.   Learning Environment Survey Data for 2017-2018 indicated the following in terms of rigorous discussion in  questioning: 72% of teachers say that students respond to challenging questions   A June 2018 RGHS School Culture and Instructional Program Survey revealed:  61% of teachers stated they ALWAYS plan and ask difficult questions  68% of teachers believe students ALWAYS feel challenged in their class       Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.

Strategies to address the needs of students with  disabilities, English language learners, and other high- need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under- credited, SIFE, STH).         Professional Development:    We will be utilizing 2 texts. “Rigor is not a 4 letter word” By  Barbara Blackburn, and “Critical thinking and Formative  Assessments” by Moore and Stanley. Our plan is two parts.  First we will evaluate our current assessments such as  quarterlies and quizzes, tasks, using WEBB ALIGN to determine  if our questions/tasks are rigorous enough to lead students  towards critical thinking and evaluation. Our goal is to align our  assessments/tasks to the shifts in the new Common Core  Regents where recall and comprehension no longer are  assessed and where analysis and evaluation are the new  determining indicators for mastery. We will meet in  departments to first create FLSA that meet this new standard  of rigor and then data mine our results. We will track student  performance over the 2018-19 school year on just rigorous  critical higher order thinking questions. Our goal is that through  repeated exposure to prompts requiring students to analyze,  evaluate and synthesize that students will improve their critical  thinking skills and that our data will increase.   Lesson Plan Modifications: Teachers will modify a minimum of  36-Lesson Plans to raise rigor in questions and tasks.      Observations: Department minutes, and MOTP Observations  will target and verify strategic implementation and impact.    Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

Quarterly exams by department are designed to target specific content aptitude and/or  deficiencies in student learning. After each quarterly assessment teachers analyze data and complete a quarterly  reflection form targeting specific students, identifying an action plan and strategies to facilitate student  understanding. Assessment content is then spiraled on each Quarterly Assessment leading to the NYS Regents exams.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43     which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. FOR THE ROBERT H. GODDARD HIGH SCHOOL FOR COMMUNICATION ARTS &  TECHNOLOGY (HS308), in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA),  is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of  student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed  by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are  encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee  as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.

We will  host a workshop in November 2018 teaching parents how to asking more open-ended questions that don’t have one  “right” answer thereby giving their children more confidence to respond in creative ways without being afraid of  being “wrong.”    Below are examples of questions parents can ask their children to spark discussion, make them think critically, and to  encourage higher order thinking.   When reading a book:            “What do you think might happen next?”  “Does this remind you of anything from your life?”  “Can you tell me about what you read today?”  “Why did he/she act that way?”   When visiting an unfamiliar place:        “How is __________ similar to/different from __________?”  “Can you explain/show me that in another way?”   When making an important decision:            “How would you rank __________?”  “How do you imagine __________ would look?”  “What do you think a solution might be?”  “Why did you decide to choose __________ over __________?

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  We use the assessment tool Achieve3000.com to assess the literacy skills of ELLs. The Achieve3000.com program provides a  baseline lexile reading score for all students using the program.  Through this program, we have learned that students are not  comprehending at a level consistent with grade-level standards, and as a result both the ELA and ENL teachers are teaching  explicit fluency, decoding, and comprehension strategies to all students who need support in these areas.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Instruction aligned to the Common Core State Standards is provided all year with lexile level reading tests given to assess  progress and growth. A standard of 10-15 lexile points per month is used as a goal for growth for each student. If this goal is  not met, further interventions are recommended. The ELL teacher tracks student lexile goal progress on a quarterly basis.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We evaluate ourselves using data analysis, unit and quarterly test results, student portfolios,  Regents exams, Achieve 3000  lexile tests,  and ongoing informal assessment of all ELLs.  Successes include students who have  moved levels on the NYSESLAT  through hard work in last year’s stand alone ENL and integrated ELA/ENL program. We use quarterly reflections and analysis to  target at risk students. Targeted interventions are then applied such as individual and group tutoring, and additional academic  scaffolding of instruction by all teachers of ELLs.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Ms. Duggan and Ms. Oh, the Assistant Principals, target students for tutoring after analyzing recent Regents results and report  card grades, as well as quarterly and mock regents examination results. They target students for lunch time tutoring and  ensure they are going through attendance, parent contact, and teacher records.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Not applicable        6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   We use regents exams, NYSESLAT, graduation rate  and credit accumulation to evaluate our ELL program.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The ENL teacher monitors and communicates student progress through the Integrated ENL co-teaching model, checking each  student's progress on their online report card, talking to all teachers about at risk students, and communicating this in reports  to the assistant principal, Ms. Duggan, such as who needs to be targeted for tutoring, and the ELL Goals for each marking  period to the principal, Dr. Birgeles. Our ENL teacher collaborates with the special education teachers to best support our ELL  students with the appropriate scaffolds.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.    The standalone class is a heterogeneous, uncredited class with units of Common Core study. Many of these units  focus on growth mindset, organization, and language acquisition.  The integrated ENL/ELA class is taught by a certified  ELA teacher, certified special education teacher and our ENL teacher, Janna Palmquist. These teachers work together  to address gaps with appropriate scaffolds.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Not applicable.      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Not applicable.        2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Each student is given the appropriate number of standalone and integrated minutes according to charts 5.1 and 5.2. Entering  students are given 1 period everyday of standalone ENL and one period of integrated ENL in ELA class. Emerging students are  given one period of standalone ENL per day and one period of integrated ENL/ELA every day. Transitioning students are given  one period of standalone per day, and one period of integrated ENL/ELA support. Expanding students are given one period of  integrated ENL/ELA support per school day. Former ELLs are given one period of integrated ENL/ELA support per day.       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Common Core units of study are used in standalone ENL. Through the use of non-fiction texts, units on various rigorous topics  are implemented through the study of CC Part 2 argumentative essay writing, and Part 3 text analysis writing to prepare  students for the Common Core ELA 11 Regents exam. In addition, extended constructed responses that simulate the essay  portions of the NYSESLAT are prepared in order to get the students ready for the NYSESLAT. Content is prepared and delivered  in integrated ENL/ELA by the certified ELA teacher and certified Special Education teacher. Access to the lesson is provided  through translation, glossaries specific to the lesson, explicit vocabulary instruction, study tips, additional explanations, verbal  scaffolding and more provided by the ENL teacher. In content area classes, access to the lesson is provided through the same  methods by the ENL teacher and content area teacher, respectively.          4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   Students are given Regents exams by their content area teachers in bilingual versions, if available, and evaluated by staff  members who speak that language. Several of our staff speak Spanish, Italian and Bengali, and communicate with the  students, informally, in their home language. However, formal assessment is not completed in their home language because  we do not have a bilingual program. In addition, students are instructed by their content area teacher and ENL teacher in how  to use glossaries which are provided for Regents exams.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a. SIFE- at this time, we do not have SIFE students. However, if this were the case we would use high interest materials  differentiated for the students' individual needs based on the assessments of the SIFE student.  b. Newcomer - Various methods are used to integrate the newcomer into the New York City school. Students are introduced to  language through the use of pictures, glossaries, dictionaries, alphabet instruction (if necessary), contextual clues, routine, and  explicit vocabulary and grammar instruction.   c. Developing - Developing students are supported through vocabulary and grammar instruction, as well as instruction on  Common Core State Standards. Emphasis is placed on non-fiction text which is approaching grade-level fluency (complex text)  and argumentative essay writing and text analysis, which is done in nearly every content area class.   d. Long Term - Long Term ELLs are given a variety of scaffolds to help them achieve the gains they have previously declined to  make. Writing scaffolds for Part 2 and 3 on the Common Core ELA 11 Regents exam as well as outlines for ELA writing  assignments and NYSESLAT practice are provided. Additional tutoring is provided to help these students pass their exams in  their content area classes, as well as extra help after school and Saturdays is offered. In addition, outside tutoring is  recommended to the parent to supplement the efforts made by the classroom teacher, school, and staff.  e. Former ELLs - Former ELLs are supported through the accomodation of Regents exams and glossaries for their Regents  exams for 2 years. In addition, students will be supported for 4-5 days a week in a grade level ELA class through integrated  ENL.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Tutoring by the ENL teacher, content area teacher, special education teacher or all is typically given to ELL-SWD during lunch,  after school and occasionally Saturdays to assist ELL-SWDs to accelerate English language development. Various materials are  made available to ELL-SWDs such as Barron's review books, glossaries, bilingual Regents exams various computer programs  such as BrainPop ESL, castlelearning.com, and Achieve3000.com. In addition, if the student has an alternate placement  paraprofessional, translation and interpretation services are provided for any and all materials where deemed appropriate by  the classroom or ENL teacher. Materials such as Empower3000.com are differentiated so that the student has a reading  selection appropriate to their particular lexile level. In addition, these reading selections are often differentiated for classroom  reading selections so that someone who reads on a  particular grade level would have reading properly suited to their lexile  level. Empower3000.com has articles on every content area and is primarily generated through articles written by the  Associated Press and are non-fiction. These accelerate English language acquisition because the students are introduced to  lexile level appropriate words that they are ready to learn. These further their acquisition of language because it helps them  learn new words everyday. Empower3000.com activities are assigned weekly by the ENL teacher and the ELA teacher to ENL  students to practice and raise their lexile level. Student growth is then measured through the data generated by level set tests  which determine the amount of growth in their lexile level at the mid-year and end-year points.          7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Every effort is made to create flexibility to give the ELL-SWDs the least restrictive environment. When possible, ICT is provided  which provides extra scaffolding and other differentiation in curricular flexibility for the ELL-SWDs. The instructional flexibility  has the content area or SPED teacher providing grade-level material (text complexity) to the students who are ELL-SWDs.  However, scheduling flexibility is maintained so that the student is provided with the appropriate program structure to achieve  their IEP goals and attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment. As the ELL-SWD presents additional  concerns, the ENL teacher and case manager work together through conversations, IEP meetings, emails, and collaboration to  provide equal access to education for these students who face additional challenges.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  ELLs receive targeted intervention programs in ELA in preparation for the English Regents.  Students are provided with various  forms of scaffolding to allow them to perform at grade level in preparation for their success during independent work on  examinations.  Students receive instruction based in writing, reading, listening and speaking in order to pass the Regents and  score Proficient on the NYSESLAT.  Furthermore, every teacher at Robert Goddard High School utilizes such sheltered content strategies as building background,  activating prior knowledge, teaching and emphasizing vocabulary, and cooperative group work, in order for them to pass their  respective Regents exams.         9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Active research continually influences the program decisions made by the ENL teacher, Janna Palmquist.   For the 2017-18 school year our teachers are participating in literature circles surrounding the book, “Make it Stick.” The  research shows that by incorporating frequent low stakes assessment, interleaving of curriculum, and generative learning that  students will outperform students who simply re-studied and were re-exposed to the material.We will incorporate more low  stakes quizzes as a way to increase student performance on the Regents.  Lessons are crafted around the Common Core standards and emphasize skills such as finding a central idea, drawing  conclusions and making inferences (among others). The success of these lessons will be evaluated based on the data (work  products) provided from the lessons and the students ability to think critically and execute these skills.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   No programs/services.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs through the encouraging inclusion and invitations of all teachers.  Students are invited to all clubs through the permission slips handed out in the beginning of the year for all students. Also, the  students are encouraged by their ENL teacher to seek out and participate in after school activities both with her and other  teachers including but not limited to ELA tutoring, Science tutoring, other content area tutoring, Art club, Drama club, Chess  club and more.        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Instructional materials for Common Core units of study are taken from scholarly and popular newspapers, journals, websites,  etc. to form the basis of a non-fiction curriculum with complex text. In addition, programs which provide immediate and  differentiated feedback in both reading comprehension, content area content and exam preparation include BrainPop,  castlelearning.com, achieve3000.com and other recommended websites, programs and books. In addition, all the classrooms  have access to a computer cart with a computer for each student, ready to interact with, research, and otherwise use the  laptop for educational purposes and to prepare them to become global citizens and participants in a global and competitive  economy. Achieve 3000 is a foundation of the standalone ENL program. The articles offered on this site are differentiated to  meet the needs of the all ELL subgroups according to lexile level. In addition, the different types of learners are addressed  through the structuring of the lesson by the ENL teacher, and if applicable, the content area teacher which includes videos on  the subject, visuals, manipulatives, songs, and daily group work to facilitate the learning style of each learner to go beyond  grouping the ELLs as subgroups and meet the individual needs of the learner.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Because our students are mostly transitioning or expanding, home language support consists mostly of access to Google  translate, dictionaries, and glossaries, which the ELLs are trained in using for exams and other learning opportunities.        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All required services/resources support correspond to ELLs' ages and grade levels by coming from current materials based in  global themes and aimed at preparing the student for college and career readiness, to be a productive, ethical, and responsible  citizen and to compete in a global economy based on innovation. Global themes are aligned to the Common Core State  Standards and prepare them to meet their graduation requirements and exit ENL through the NYSESLAT. Global themes have  previously included current topics that every global citizen needs to consider such as issues such as sustainability, war, issues in  the political process (History), issues in character education and health. Students' ages and grade levels are considered when  determining what level the work product should be. The expectation for an argumentative essay produced by a 9  th   grader  are very different from the expectations of an argumentative essay for an 11  th   grader. Length, sophistication of concepts,  ideas, and language, elaboration of and explanation of analysis are all expected to be increasing more in depth and insightful  as the students progress from 9  th   to 11  th   grade. The goal for every student is to have a 4 on Part 2 of the Common Core  ELA exam and a 3 on Part 3 of the Common Core ELA exam by 11  th   grade. These students are in a heterogenous classroom  with mixed grades in standalone ENL so differentiation is completed by lexile level.        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?     Our school shares a building with a middle school.  The middle school gives the grade appropriate NYSESLAT exam as do  we.  We work closely with the middle school AP who supervises ENL if a issue or question arises in the past we have shared  glossaries and books when necessary.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   School counselors provide students with a buddy who shows them the school and around to their classrooms, and explains (in  their native language if possible) school routines, culture, important places such as nurse's office and main office, and the roles  of principals, teachers and students in conjunction with other staff members such as the parent coordinator, principal and ENL  teacher.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58            17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Spanish electives are offered to ELLs.       18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Not applicable.       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?   All ELL personnel at Goddard will attend professional development workshops to address both instructional and compliance  needs.  The ENL teacher will attend at least five workshops throughout the school year including network professional  development to keep up to date on research, learn how to complete administrative duties such as the LAP report and BESIS,  and any other Department of ELL professional development sessions deemed appropriate. Our in-house professional  development for all teachers of ELLs will be completed by the ENL teacher and ELL Coordinator. These are ELL specific  professional development sessions on these dates for our entire teaching staff. The type of pd we are having will be vocabulary  development, literacy skills, scaffolding higher level texts for ELLS and helping struggling students meet the CCSS. We  understand that these strategies will be applicable for all struggling students and that is why we feel that our staff needs this  support.      ELL teachers are offered professional development through the network. Focus on Common Core is common to these PDs and  webinars that explain how to create a more rigorous program. In addition, PD through the school is offered which teaches the  teachers of ELLs how to engage students in more rigorous lessons through planning Common Core units of study and tasks.  PDs at the school include elevating the rigor of the classroom to include Common Core standards for argumentative essay  writing and our lesson plan protocol on Monday afternoon seeks to focus on one standard at a time and the related skill set, to  create data on these skills, to analyze this data and then create a new cycle on the same standard of the lesson plan protocol  or maintain the method if it satisfied our needs. The lesson plan protocol is one of our professional development opportunities  for our teachers of ELLs to collaborate and evaluate the efficacy of their daily lessons in getting students to achieve on  standards-based assessments.         2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.      Our aim is to provide at least 5 hours per year of ELL-specific PDs throughout the school year to all teachers of ELLs. This  would amount to over 25 hours of the 175 required to retain certification, and represents approximately 15%. ELL-specific PDs  will be identified by the ENL teacher through the email blast from the Department of the ELLs. In addition to these PDs, school  wide PDs will be offered which specifically address the needs of the ELL learner in the classroom. These will be tracked  individually by each teacher, as well as attendance taken by the principal at each meeting. The ENL teacher will reach 50% by  attending at least 4 days of PD on ELL-specific topics in order to reach  17.5 hours of ELL-specific PD per year, which would add   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59         up to 175 over 5 years in order to renew her certification. Records are maintained through sign in sheets at meetings, yearly  professional development logs kept by both teachers and assistant principals Ms. Oh and Ms. Duggan.         Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Individual meetings with parents of ELLs are scheduled on Tuesday afternoons with the ENL teacher and any other content  area teachers who are available and are invited to attend. They take place in the ENL teacher's room and discuss the goals of  the program (exit ENL/ESL, pass 5 Regents exams, graduate, accumulate credits, achieve academic excellence) the language  development of the students, the NYSESLAT/NYSITELL results, and the feedback from other teachers provided in a report  submitted through email from the content area teachers to the ENL teacher prior to the meeting. Interpretation is provided  over the phone as needed or by the ENL teacher or another staff member.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Records and meetings with ELL parents are the responsibilities of the ENL teacher, Janna Palmquist. Parent meetings are  recorded, as well as phone calls, in an excel file by Ms. Palmquist. These are kept in electronic as well as hard copies in her  cabinet. These are then collected in June by the Assistant principals. Translation services are also documented on this file.    Robert H. Goddard High School’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities.  Our school  community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement policy with ELL  parents to improve the academic quality of our school. The findings of the evaluation through school surveys and feedback  forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and enhance the school’s program.  This  information will be maintained by the school.   In developing Robert H. Goddard High School’s Parent Involvement Policy, parent members of the school’s Parent Association  (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, including the parent coordinator,  Rose Pino were consulted on the Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input.  To  increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, Robert H. Goddard High School will:  •Actively involve and engage all parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s programs as  outlined in the Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and  School-Parent Compact in language that all parents understand  •Support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team and the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) as well as the parent coordinator, Rose Pino. This includes providing technical  support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills in languages that all parents  understand    •Maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person), Rose Pino, to serve as a liaison between the school and  families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of  the parents of children who attend our school and will work to ensure that our school environment is welcoming and inviting  to all parents.  The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents each month and file  a report with the Central Office for Family Engagement and Advocacy (OFEA) in language that all parents understand.  The Parent Coordinator, Rose Pino, serves the parents' needs by also being our Language Access Coordinator, and arranging  for or providing translation and interpretation services for our parents by the Translation and Interpretation Unit. She uses all  materials provided by the unit to communicate with new parents and determine their needs.              2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Joseph Birgeles, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Robert H.
