This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Teachers Preparatory School   Our Mission    We are dedicated to creating an environment that fosters optimism, creativity, critical thinking, and lifelong learning.

Our Vision    We are a school that fosters academic excellence and prepares future community leadership. Within our school  community, adults and students communicate with genuine respect, effectively manage conflict, respect judgment,  and learn and grow together. Teachers maintain high expectations for student achievement and students understand  and meet these expectations. By understanding and meeting these expectations, our students prepare for entrance  into competitive colleges and subsequently into teaching and/or leadership careers.      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.

Of all students  tested 40% are emerging, 20% are transitioning, 40% are expanding and 0% are commanding.   Our school offers Integrated Co-Teaching (ICT), Special Education Teacher Support Services (SETSS) and self-contained  services. In addition, 44 students including General Education and Special Education students are over-aged and  under-credited.   Teachers Preparatory School is a 8-12 school that is currently in the process of being truncated. By September 2019,  Teachers Preparatory School (TPS) will be a high school, only. During the past few years, we have been invited to  participate in many of the Department of Education’s Equity and Excellence For All initiatives. We are a Computer  Science for All, Algebra for All, Single Shepherd, College Access for All High School & Middle School and an AP for All  school, in addition to being a LINCT school. Also, we are a continued member of the Young Men Initiative which  started several years ago. The program is now called Peer to Peer. The demographic of focus for For the first time last  year we are offered AP Computer Science. In addition, we are offering AP English Literature and AP Biology. In 2018- 2019, we are offering AP Spanish Language and Culture. Through our College Access for All participation we  developed several programs that will build leadership skills in our students. Starting in the spring 2017 and during the  summer, we began our training to open a new program with the guidance of Center for Supportive Schools. We have  created a Peer Leadership Program using the Peer Group Connections curriculum from Center for Supportive School’s.  We completed a successful year. In addition, one teacher and 4 students will complete a second summer training  session at St. John University so that for the second year in September scholars can support their classmates with the  college application process using the Peer Forward Curriculum developed by College Summit. This initiative is funded  by the College Access for All. Our summer bridge program supported by Algebra for All, offered rising grade 8  students and rising grade 9 students opportunity to think positively about learning using the Open Mindset principles.  Grade 11 students will participate in an elective course that will provide them with a tool box of strategies to be  college and career ready upon graduation. This is a 3 year program that follows our students in to their first year of  college. The curriculum and professional development is provided by One Goal. Our Single Shepherd social worker  and guidance team have been a tremendous support at our school providing the social and emotional and scholastic  guidance for all of our students. TPS’s flagship Teach for Tomorrow (TFT) Program and our Art Centered Program  (ACP) are expanding and thriving. Favorites at our school are the Spoken Word collaboration with BAM courses and  the Educator Rising Program.

Some of our partners are Mark Morris Dance  Troupe, Medgar Evers College, Camba, BAM, and Metropolitan Museum of Art. A major success at our school this past  year was offering our grade 8 students high school classes. Many of our grade 8 students, upon promotion to high  school passed the English, US History, Algebra and Living Environment Regents examinations and earned high school  credits. In addition, several students earned 2 credits in LOTE as a result of them passing the Checkpoint A  assessment. Our goal has been to support our middle school students to be high school ready, as well as being, along  with our high school students college and career ready.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   As in all schools, students arrive to us with varying skill sets. We are committed to support all of our students so upon  graduation they are college and career ready. We are creating avenues so our students with Individual Education  Plans can have the opportunity to participate in AP courses. Rigorous courses as chemistry and Algebra 2 are offered  with co-teachers. Our art teacher and special education teacher participated in an art training at Columbia University  to support our AP Art program. We are offering pre-AP Computer Science to our students and all students have access  to our AP Literature and AP Economics Programs. We offer blended instruction for students who work best using this  format and offer Saturday Academy and PM School to provide supports to all students. Our young men of color are  encouraged to participate in their self-named club called E.G.O. (Exceptional Gentlemen Organization) that provides  our young men with mentoring, social emotional and scholastic guidance and opportunity to take on leadership roles.  Our students who have passed Regents exams early and accumulated credits early have the option to participate in  internship opportunities in their senior year, take multiple AP Courses or graduated early with college credits through  our Dual College Credit program and College Now program with Medgar Evers, .       4.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Teachers Preparatory High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title  I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.       Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students  Teachers Preparatory High School will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  During the 2015-2016 school year, all students at Teachers Preparatory High School took the STAR Reading Diagnostic Test.  The data reported on the results pages indicated an overall grade equivalency for each student as well as a score for specific  skill areas. The majority of the ELL population was reported to have between a second and fourth grade independent reading  grade equivalency. Additionally, the ELLs uniformly received their lowest scores in the Key Ideas and Details skill area, which  includes skills such as identifying details and drawing conclusions. In response to these scores, the school inquiry team  developed a cross-curricular instructional protocol for identifying key ideas in readings and explicitly focused on modeling and  assessing the skill in all subject areas. At inquiry team meetings, teachers from all disciplines examined work from ELLs, the  inquiry focus group, to assess progress in identifying key ideas. Over the course of the school year, ELLs were found to more  consistently identify main ideas in subject area texts based on the team’s assessment of student work samples. Having seen  progress with the instructional protocols in places, the emphasis on identifying key ideas has continued into this school year.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?        3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The success of our programs for ELLs is evaluated through a variety of means that include the following: credit accumulation,  NYSESLAT scores, the ELL Periodic Assessment, Regents and LOTE scores, college and career readiness, and graduation rates.  Furthermore, analysis of data from the AMAO Estimator Tool has helped drive instuction. Additionally, grade teams work with  the ESL teacher to ensure that ELLs are included in the planning of lessons so they are able to participate  perform on the same  level as their peers in subject areas by translating materials as well as scaffolding activities.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?         5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Majority of ELLs score advanced or proficient on the speaking modality of the 2014-2015 NYSESLAT. For students at the  intermediate and advanced levels, the lowest modality scores were in the listening or writing sections this past school year.  The beginning ELL received his lowest score on the speaking modality. The NYSESLAT modality data indicates that the majority  of the ELL population has a firm grasp on the Basic Interpersonal Communication Skills (BICS) required for the type of  conversational exchanges represented on the Speaking modality of the test. The students require further instruction in  Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency (CALP) for understanding the type of academic input from this past year’s Listening  section and producing academic writing in the Writing section.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?

Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   We have a free standing ESl class and in addition the ESL teacher pushes into some classes with our ELLs with special  educational needs.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?                 Our program is Free standing ENL therefore our students receive ENL hours according to their proficiencey levels.       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.         Cooperative learning strategies are utilized in addition to scaffolding, graphic organizers, information gap activities,  interview grid, strip story, role playing, think-pair-share, popcorn, making connections, buddy read, choral read, questioning,  predicting, making inferences, listening, brainstorming, and various other strategies are used to make content comprehensible  and to enrich language development. The teacher utilizes a variety of instructional materials to support our ELLs. In addition,  wherever possible, materials and text in theThe focus in these classes is to develop academic reading, writing, listening and  speaking skills as our school goal is evidence based writing. Our ENL teacher uses a wide variety of authentic materials in  English to develop English language skills. Our ESL teacher regularly confers with content-area teachers to align course  materials with content classes. All course curriculum is aligned with New York State Standards. As a whole, our staff is  modifying curriculum to reflect the Common Core State Standards and this is also reflected in ENL curriculum. L1 are provided  to students in the content areas. Students are also availed laptops to enable them easy access to interpretation.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?         1.     To ensure that our ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home language we use the Spanish LAB-R for our Latino  ELLS. We use a piece of writing for our Haitian and Arabic students. These writings are then read by our Haitian and Arabic  teachers who collaborate to assess and evaluate literacy levels in native languages. Further, we also assess reading fluency in  native language. Again with the collaboration of native speakers (parents and teachers). The information gathered through  these evaluations enable us to determine weather or not our ELLs are SIFE students or not, which then further informs  instruction.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a.     Our SIFE students receive daily instructions in ESL, ELA and NLA. SIFE students with strong native language get instructions  that          target the use of their language for content in all subjects. Extended day, Saturday Academy and tutoring are also given to  our SIFE students. We have noted that SIFE students perform best when they work in small groups so we aim to group in ways  that best serve their individual needs.   b.     Based on the results of their LAB-R/NTSESLAT assessments, newcomers to the English Language School System will  receive their mandated ESL services. Small group or individual instruction will focus on their immediate needs to facilitate a  smooth transition. In addition, classroom teachers will provide support to the newcomers by placing them in groups with  native English language speakers as well as students who share the same first language as the newcomers. Students will  participate in small group, task-oriented situations that guide the production of language both in verbal and written form.  Students’ seating arrangements will enable them to clearly see and hear the teacher during instruction.   c.      For ELLS receiving services for 4 to 6 years, both the classroom teacher and the ESL teacher use scaffolding and realia.  Some examples of scaffolding used include, the use of graphic organizers to organize information, chunking and modification  of text and the use of visuals where possible e.g. video clip, or pictures. In addition different forms of groupings which give  many opportunities for the ELLs to use language are encouraged in most lessons.

For long-term ELLs, we plan to run summer school that ensures that ELLs maintain and improve English skills they  acquired during the school year. We Maintain consistency of students' programs and services because we have noted that  inconsistency from year to year had a harder time acquiring English. We also explicitly teach literacy to long-term ELLs, and do  not assume that such students have prior literacy instruction (either in their home language or in English), and we aim to  include infuse literacy instruction across the curriculum. During the school year, academic English is emphasized with this  group of ELLs because the already have full command of BICs but need to improve on the CALP in order to succeed. To this  end, non-fiction content based texts, oral presentations of research and projects based learning are used in the classroom to  enable the Long Terms acquire academic English. Critical thinking is emphasized while building on academic vocabulary within  context.   e.     For ELLs continue to receive academic support for ESL teacher for at least 2 years. This takes the form of extended day  assistance, collaboration with content teachers to continue differentiating instructions for these students and a continuation  of academic vocabulary development plan. If the student is struggling in a certain content area, push in and tutoring is  considered immediately.           Our ESL students receive all mandated testing acommodations. In all exams and tests they receive time and a half, a  content glossary and a bilingual dictionary. We endevor to translate all tests where possible and also utilize intepretation  services ssist our students. Our students also take their exams in separate location, and where an article is to be read, the ESL  students get a third reading.          6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Our ELLs with special needs have access to high-quality instruction designed to help them meet high expectations. Teachers  employ strategies known to be effective with English learners, such as drawing on their prior knowledge; providing  opportunities to review previously learned concepts and teaching them to employ those concepts; organizing themes or  strands that connect the curriculum across subject areas; and providing individual guidance, assistance, and support to fill gaps  in background knowledge. Strategies used for our ESL students with special educational needs include activating the schema  using high interest materials and activities, ESL is intergrated with content, the use of visuals and Total Physical Response,  Explicit teaching of vocabulary within content, contexulized teaching within small groups or pairs. Providing ample  opportunities for students to use language. In addition activities are structured and predictable. We collaborate using these  strategies to provide a learning environment that is conducive for our ESL-SWDs. ELL -SWDs receive ESL program according to  their proficiency level and the NYSESLAT results informs programing for these students..         7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Our ESL-SWDs are provided with content based curriculum taught in general education classes (least ristrictive). Scheduling  takes account overall services the students is receiving and we ensure flexibility wthin the schedule. Flexibility in the schedule  here means that sometimes the ESL teacher pushes into a content area class to support language and other times the student  is pulled out for enrichment or pre-teaching. ELL_SWDs are placed in our ICT program depending on their academic  anbehavioral plan. Our goal is to ensure that they continue to thrive in the least restrictive environment.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  English proficient students receive targeted daily instruction provided by our teachers, our in-house intervention system, and  our afterschool intervention programs in English and Mathematics. Intensive instruction in reading and writing, problem  solving and critical thinking skills were reinforced along with essential test taking strategies.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      1. We ensure that our ELLs receive early, explicit, and intensive instruction in phonological awareness and phonics in order to  build decoding skills this intervention is done by the ESL teacher.  2. We make sure that all our classes increase opportunities for ELLs to develop functional vocabulary, in ELA students do a  variety of scaffolded activities to aid the acquistion of academic vocabulary using graphic organizers.   3. We equip ELLs with strategies and knowledge to comprehend and analyze challenging narrative and expository texts  through scaffolding and differention of instructions.  4. We intervene to promote ELLs’ reading fluency focus on vocabulary development and increased exposure to print.  5. We promote independent reading that is both purposeful and structured and good reader-text match therefore in social  studeies and science, the teachers chuck text, and use questions to guid reading reading. For intermediate and beginner  students we cloze text and hands on experiments are done with the students. Including as many visuals as possible to enhance  comprehension.   6.

Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      We have no plans to change our current program for the next academic year unless the number of ELLs increases to more than  20       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We will not be discontinuing any programs that serve our ELLs either.        11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All our ELLs, regardless of their proficient level, are required to attend extended program 3 times a week for language  enrichment and intervention in other content areas. ELLs have equal access to all programs that are provided by our school.  Presently all the ELLs are mandated to stay for extended day. Saturday academy and PM school are also offered in our school  and ELLs are given priority to enlist given their needs. We also have an early morning tutoring program which affords our ELLs  with opportunities for further intervention.        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  To support our ELLs, we have a library with an assortment of books in both Spanish and English. We also have supplementary  NYSESLAT preparation books, bilingual dictionaries, computers, technology software such as ELLIS, and access to Achieve3000,  which is a reading enrichment program. In addition, some of our classrooms now have Smart Boards; therefore, our students  are able to have more visuals in the classrooms. Students have access to laptops too, which they use to research in their native  languages.    In the content areas student have access to laptops which provide them with access to interpreting for themselves easily.  Teachers   also use the smartboard frequently to show visuals which aid learning.         13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?      We realize the important role of the native language both as the main tool of communication for our students and the  foundation of literacy for our ELLs, and therefore we endeavor to encourage the continual use of the home language by  providing books, music      and materials in our students’ home language in our ESL classrooms. We also encourage parents to continue using the home    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         language at home so our students can maintain it.          14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All services support and resources correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels. We have grade level multiliteracies. We also  have   simpler reading books for our ESL students to learn the structure of the English Language.         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    To support our ELLs, we have a library with an assortment of books in both Spanish and English. We also have supplementary  NYSESLAT preparation books, bilingual dictionaries, computers, technology software such as ELLIS, and access to Achieve3000,  which is a reading enrichment program. In addition, some of our classrooms now have Smart Boards; therefore, our students  are able to have more visuals in the classrooms.

Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Activites to assist newly enrolled ESL students before they begin school include a tour of their classrooms and included in the  tour, the bathrooms, cafeteria. We aim to introduce them to their core teachers before they start school so that they are more  confortable. We also tell them of our buddy system, where they get a classmate, to look after them for a while.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Spanish      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  We are planning ongoing school-wide professional development for all teachers on incorporating ESL strategies to make  content comprehensible for ESL and struggling readers and writers. Our ESL teacher and select content-area teachers will  attend Q-TEL trainings Many of the outside PDs are organized by CFN 611. In house we dedicate 1 professional development  for each semester, unless teachers make special requests. Our ESL teacher also liaises with content are teachers, to discusses  ways in which they can make their content area more accessible to ELLs. Our current focus is evidence based writing, a   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         requisite of the Common Core Learning Standards. Our teachers in content have had in house professional development  toenable them to particpate in a dialogue on how to ensure that ELLs are getting appropiate scafolds.        We hold a school-wide orientation for all entering students in the beginning of the year. Freshman teachers regularly meet to   discuss student progress and develop specific lesson designed to facilitate a student’s adjustment to high school. These  professional developments act as platforms for exchanging best practices, where teachers are armed with strategies to scafold  learning for ELLs.          2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Our content teachers and paraprofessionals including our support staff receive suport from the ENL teacher to ensure that the  students have a smooth transition and are feel safe in our school.  During the orientation, students and their families are  introduced to their  content teachers.  Students are also paired with a budy in their homeroom.  Additonally the ENL staff  provides professional development to content area teachers and Saturday Academy teachers. Participating teachers receive  support at meetings and in the classroom on strategies and methodologies pertaining to teaching content to ELLs and  developing English language in the content area.   As of October, ENL teacher prepared and delivered a professional development session in conjuction with the special  education department.  In addition she has visited the content teachers of all the ELLs to discuss specific student needs,  scaffolding strategies and  accomodations.  Since we have a small ELL population, professional developments will be driven by  teacher needs and these will include grade and departmental ELL professional development, professional development specific  to paraprossesionals working with ELLs as tailored talks with our support staff on how to best support our ELLs and their  families.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Paste response to question here:            2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   1.     We have the privilege of having very active parents in our school. Parents volunteer at the cafeteria, assistant in school  wide events, chaperone the students on school trip, provide food for events, fundraise and also assist in the classrooms. We  have a good parent presence outside school, which helps build our community and reinforce safety. We also invite parents to  visit our classrooms in organized tours and by appointment. Some parents have also made the decision to sit in some of the  classes to support their children, if the children were having challenges behavioral or academic in those classes.  Parents also come to our school to share their careers and life experiences without students in certain units. This collaboration  has proved a motivator for both parent participation as well as student performance.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Carmen Simon, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:                                                                                   School DBN:     Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
