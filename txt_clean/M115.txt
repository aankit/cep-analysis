The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7     In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           8       NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           10      Section 4: SCEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Our School’s Mission is to foster student creativity and critical thinking through real world problem solving and  exploration.    Our School’s Vision is to empower students to use innovation and creativity to change the world.       2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   The Alexander Humboldt Magnet Academy Of Science And Exploration at PS 115 is an elementary school with 448  students from pre-kindergarten through grade 5. The school population comprises 0.67% Black; 94.20% Hispanic;  3.35% White; 0.45% Native Americans; 0.67% Hawaiian. The student body includes 26.34% English Language  Learners and 18.75% Special Education students. Boys account for 47.10% of the students enrolled and girls  account for 52.90% of students enrolled. The average attendance for the school year, 2017-2018 was 92.7%.   Our school’s Core Beliefs are:      We believe in assessing students for learning using data analysis from both formal and informal sources as   an instructional guide to help our students succeed academically.     We believe that in order for students to succeed academically we need to consider the “whole child” by   nurturing their physical and emotional wellness.     We believe that in order to improve the academic achievement of all students, we must provide our   students with differentiated process, content, and product.     We believe that higher order thinking questioning strategies and rigorous tasks lead to high levels of   student engagement.         3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   We currently are in partnership with Columbia Presbyterian Hospital and the “Turn 2 Us” Program focused on our  students’ social-emotional needs to ensure that we provide a full range of learning opportunities, services, and  supports to prepare our students for success, both during their years at P.S. 115 and beyond.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/information,  early intervention services, etc.).  We prepare our pre-kindergarten students with developmentally appropriate routines, curriculum, and pedagogy that  contribute to their emotional and social well-being and growth. The ECERS checklist and guidelines for early childhood  education inform our teachers’ practices. We provide ongoing parent workshops to support the parents and their  children move from early childhood program to the elementary school program and its ever-growing expectations for  college and career readiness. All early grade staff participates in school-wide PL to ensure continuity and appropriate  learning targets and progressions. Students’ records are kept by all teachers and are shared as the students are  promoted from early grades to the upper grades. Teachers receiving these children have full and clear portraits of the  students as learners in all dimensions of growth and development. Paraprofessionals, family worker and social  worker, as well as parent coordinator ensure close home-school connections, on an ongoing basis.        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     The Principal formed an original MOSL Committee in the Spring of 2014, in collaboration with the UFT Chapter  Chairperson, in accordance with the guidelines of the ADVANCE Evaluation System. The School Leaders and the UFT  Chapter Chairperson selected members for the committee. The committee continues to meet throughout the year.  They reviewed the options and selected the state and local assessment measures, with the final decisions made by  the School Leaders, who were in accordance with the teachers’ choices. In addition, during the school year 2015- 2016, the school developed a vertical Literacy/Math team to embed formative assessments into their curriculum  maps, along with the data committee to gather and analyze data to inform instruction. In the school year 2016-2017,  the school will develop an assessment calendar in order to align all of the assessments throughout the school. The  benchmark periods will be September 2016, January 2017 and May 2017. Teachers will receive differentiated  professional learning opportunities around data-driven instruction (DDI). Their use of DDI will be monitored by school  leaders through the Instructional Practice Monitoring Tool.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

Section 5E.      1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.           2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           48     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           49           Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           50      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       PS 115 Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)    Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 115, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I is responsible for  creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student  achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by  actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children.             Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Teacher Association, and Title I  Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. P.S. 115 will support  parents and families of Title I students by:   · Providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   · Providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           51      · Fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   · Providing assistance to parents in understanding the Common Core Learning Standards and assessments.   · Sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   · Providing professional learning opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve outreach,  communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other members of  the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English as a New Language students and students with disabilities.  The school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this Parent Involvement  Policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.   In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent-Teacher Association, as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on  the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input. To increase  and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   · Actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   · Engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated directly  to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   · Ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   · Support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent- Teacher Association and Title I Parent Committee.

In order  to continue to close the achievement gap amongst our ELL student population and ensure they  meet grade level standards, we will continue supporting language development through the use  of explicit instruction, ENL strategies,  vocabulary development,assessment in instruction, and  opportunities for discourse. Student work books and non-fiction and fiction text with CDs will be  purchased  at an estimated cost of $2,894.00 and will be used soly for the after school Title III  program.  Students will receive 45 sessions of after school instruction.  The use of Fundations,  Shared Reading, Guided Reading, Read Alouds, Independent Reading and conferring as well as  elements of the writing process will be provided to all students. The elements of the writing  process will be scaffolded  to support the different language proficiency levels. Sentence,  paragraph and composition structure will be taught to improve reading, writing, literary  understanding and enable students to increase their general knowledge.  We will provide  supplementary ENL instruction to a total of 72 students. The goal of the program is to provide  students with a conducive and rigorous learning environment that will help students develop the  language skills necessary to advance through the language proficiency levels, achieve a  commanding level on the NYSESLAT, and mainstreaming to a monolingual class.   Title III services will be provided two days a week, Wednesdays and Thursdays, from 2:30 pm  to 4:00 pm.  There will be a total of 6 qualified certified teachers:  1 ENL, and 5 Bilingual;  our  target population consist of ENL students in grades 2- 5 who have made little progress for two  consecutive years, as well as those students who came  close to obtaining language proficiency  on the NYSESLAT. During the duration of the program we will be instructing and supporting  6  groups of about 12 students per group in grades 2-5.   The program will begin Wednesday, October 17, 2018 and will end on May 30, 2019.  Each  session will last for 1 1/2 hours focused on literacy and opportunities for listening and  discussion.  Students will be assigned 20 minutes each day to work on grammar and  conventions.  Each teacher is responsible for planning and delivering quality instruction in  literacy.  The language of instruction will be in English. However, the home language  will be used as  deemed appropriate.  Materials:  Students will use a variety of non-fiction and fiction books in English with strong  visual support, engaging illustrations, video clips and graphic organizers to help them make  meaning from the texts.  We will use the Escalate to English curriculum for grades 4 & 5, Finish  Line New York ELLs Bilingual Common Core and Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  PS 115 uses the following formative assessments to guide instruction: Resi report, item analysis, portfolio assessment, writing  assessments, TCRWP, Fundations, and other assessment tools such as: NYSITELL and MOSL  to identify and address student  areas of need while targeting areas for growth. In order to meet and exceed Common Core Standards, students in grades K-5  will complete benchmark assessments in reading, writing, and mathematics.  Results generated from these assessments, will  help teachers focus on specific students' areas in need of extra instructional support and to develop targeted instructional  strategies. Teachers will assess students around concepts of print, letter identification, letter sounds, and spelling (sight  words).  They will use this data to inform their instruction during lessons, to conduct student conferences and to form small       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           65      groups. Spanish Running Records from levels A - Z will help teachers make appropriate decisions as they select reading  materials/resources for students. In addition, the school Response to Intervention (RtI) team uses assessment tools and  aggressive intervention that enable teachers to identify students in need of Tier I, II, and III interventions.          2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Teachers complete a reading differentiated action plan in October, January and May after completing running records. This  action plan has teachers group their students based on reading level (far below expectation, approaching expectations,  performing on grade level expectation, above grade level expectations) and create an instructional plan for these groups. The  action plan helps guide reading instruction to the next benchmark period. Teachers also use the reflection tool to create  groups and develop an action plan for writing and math. Data meetings are held 4 times a year to discuss student data and  develop instructional next steps in reading, writing, and math. Teachers are provided with ongoing professional development  sessions around strategies and entry points for students’ proficiency levels.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Our school has implemented three benchmark periods to monitor student growth. Reading, writing, and math baseline  assessments are provided in September. These assessments are analyzed to inform instruction and form student groups. Mid- year assessments are given in January. Data meetings are held to analyze student growth from September through January,  and action plans are created around students' areas of need. End of year assessments are provided in May/June. These  assessments are analyzed to plan for next year and provide teachers with differentiated professional development targeted to  areas of need.          4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Based on the data, we have decided to use the following intervention programs:    Based on the data, we have decided to use the following intervention programs   ASPIRA, intervention afterschool and Saturday academy to support ENL students with language development, science, reading  and math intervention.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]      Evaluation of the data provides teachers with the opportunity to obtain information about their students' strengths and areas  of need in English language development. Implementing the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework supports teachers in  identifying the difference  between a learning disability and difficulty with language acquisition. The data sources used for this  process include the following:-Results from the Spring English Language Assessment (NYSESLAT)- Number of years of  instruction in a Bilingual or English setting- Running Records in English and Spanish- Student work products  - Pre and post writing assessments   During the school year, our English as a New Language Team and RtI team will continue to meet regularly to analyze and  discuss student data and note trends to meet the demanding needs of our student population. Teachers use the data and  make the needed adjustments to lesson and unit plans in order to provide multiple entry points for ELLs. Students who fall into  Tier I receive explicit language instruction, sheltered instruction observation protocol (SIOP), sentence starters, manipulatives,  graphic organizers, visuals, technology, etc.  Data is analyzed regularly, and students who are making minimal progress receive  small group instruction and increased individual conferences (Tier II). Students who require more support receive intensive  individual intervention (Tier III).  In addition, information gathered during these meetings is utilized to develop professional  development, make curricular adjustments and provide targeted interventions for our ELL population.         2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           66         6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The outcome assessments used are NYSESLAT, ELA and Math state assessments. The data collected is used to make  adjustments to lessons, curriculum and intervention programs. Due to our most recent NYSESLAT data, the Administrative  Cabinet team decided to continue the Cloud 9 curriculum and implement a Saturday ENL program for grades 2 thru 5 to  support students with language acquisition.        7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Meetings are structured on a weekly basis where bilingual teachers analyze the data along with the administrative cabinet. The  findings are shared with through professional development sessions and in writing.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.                 ENL instruction is delivered through stand-alone and integrated teaching. The focus is on explicit instruction  that incorporates ENL Strategies, repetition, vocabulary, and the use of native language to support student  understanding.  Teachers use a variety of  instructional approaches through differentiation in order to provide students with access to  student choice. These instructional approaches include the use of visuals, Total Physical Response, manipulatives,  explicit modeling, repetition and the use of artefact's. In addition, other activities are also used to meet the needs of  our ELLs. These include read-alouds, shared reading, close reading, independent writing practice, grammar, partner  and group discussions. Also, students are heterogeneously grouped.  In addition, ENL teachers and classroom  teachers work collaboratively to make sure students receive their mandated minutes of instruction and language  development.       b.  TBE program.  If applicable.                 Our Transitional Bilingual classes deliver ENL instruction through the content areas. ENL Strategies are used to  support the four modalities of listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Teachers use a variety of approaches to  support the acquisition of the English language using ESL methodologies and instructional strategies, such as visuals,  manipulatives, vocabulary, modeling, repetition and the use of artifacts, etc. Content areas such as science and social  studies are taught in English. Scaffolds and differentiated instruction are used to support students during these  periods.                c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A        2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           67      a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?     In collaboration with the school administration, teachers review NYSESLAT and NYSITELL data for students in each  Transitional Bilingual class to ensure that the language of instruction is properly distributed within the daily instructional  program. In the Transitional Bilingual classes, teachers provide instruction according to their students' levels. For example,  the  first grade literacy block time is devoted to 90 minutes of native language literacy skills, and 90 minutes of English language  literacy skills. As the students progress through the different language levels, the amount of English Language instruction  increases. Student conferencing and small group instruction are provided in either English or Spanish depending on the needs  and strengths of the group of students. All transitional bilingual classes receive math instruction in Spanish. The language of  other content area instruction varies depending upon language proficiency level, NYSESLAT and NYSITELL data.    For the Free Standing English as a New Language program, the ENL teacher provides the 2 units of instruction for entering and  emerging students, and 1 unit of instruction for the transitioning, expanding, and commanding students.  Student resources  and materials are also provided to classrooms of ELLs to ensure that native language support is available for students.  However, all English instruction is provided through the use of various ENL strategies and techniques with a focus on  vocabulary development, comprehension, grammar, and writing.       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.                          The Transitional Bilingual classes in grades K through 2 use the Teachers College curriculum for literacy in English and  Spanish. The Transitional Bilingual classes in grades 3 through 5 use the EngageNY curriculum for literacy in English. The  bilingual teacher translates the students' workbook to Spanish and uses books in Spanish that are the same or similar.  Math instruction for all Transitional Bilingual classes is provided in Spanish.  Enrichment classes provide instruction in English.  The classroom teacher will provide students with regular instruction as per Part 154 Regulations (360-180 minutes of ENL per  week and minimum of 90-45 minutes daily of NLA instruction). However, all English instruction is provided through the use of  various ENL strategies and techniques with a focus on vocabulary development, comprehension, grammar, and  writing.  Materials and conferring, as well as small group instruction, are provided in English and Spanish.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?                   Currently, teachers in the Transitional Bilingual Kindergarten and first grade classes utilize Estrellita.  Estrellita is a  Spanish program that consists of various assessments pre, post and on going assessments to monitor progress and to ensure  that students advance from one level to the next.  Teachers in the Transitional Bilingual classes use running records in Spanish,  writing, exit slips, observations, conferring and the Examen de lectura en Espanol (ELE) to evaluate students' progress in their  native language.          5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status      a. Currently, we don't have Students with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE) attending our school.  However, should any  students with interrupted formal education (SIFE) enroll at PS 115 they will receive intensive reading, writing and language  development via small group instruction, teacher made assessments and running records by their classroom teacher.  In  addition, they will receive their mandated instructional ENL block as determined by NYSESLAT data.  SIFE students will be also  be invited to attend the Title III after school ASPIRA program.  Moreover, explicit one to one classroom instruction, explicit  teacher modeling and student practice with teacher guidance and feedback will facilitate student learning.  The official teacher  of the SIFE is required to provide instruction as per Part 154 Regulations (360 minutes of ENL per week and 90 minutes of daily       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           68      NL).  It is expected that with all these supports in place, SIFE students will be able to develop not only the necessary language  skills but also the necessary literacy and math skills to help them begin bridging the educational gap.  In the event that more  support is needed, students will be invited to attend the District summer Title III Enrichment program when  available.  b.    Newcomers that have been in the US school system for less than 3 years will be identified by the ELL  Coordinator, Ms. Vargas by class and grade. At the end of the year, students who fall in this category will be strongly  encouraged (parents informed) to attend the District Summer Enrichment Program. During the regular school day, the ENL  teacher as well as classroom teachers provided the needed support to our newcomers.c.      Students receiving service for 4-6  years will follow the protocol described below:         The official teacher of the student is required to provide instruction as per  Part 154 Regulations (360-180 minutes of ENL per week and 90-45 minutes of daily NL, if applicable).  In the event that more  support is needed, students will attend the District Summer Enrichment Program.  Promotion will be assessed with a possible  extension of services.  The students' progress in language acquisition and content area achievement will be reviewed via  teacher and student conferencing, portfolio reviews and assessments throughout the school year.d.     Students having  completed 6 years of service will follow the protocol described below:        The ELL Coordinator and/or ENL teacher will identify  the student by grade and class.  Meet with the parents, teachers, and Assistant Principals in charge of Bilingual and Special  Education instruction.  The AP will immediately assign grade appropriate AIS for the areas of need.  The official teachers of this  population of students, within their class, will provide instruction as per Part 154 Regulations.e.     Former ELLs will have  extended time on New York State assessments. They will have extra support from the ENL teacher and receive ENL instruction  for 90 minutes per week. Testing accommodations are provided for ELA, Mathematics, and Science. All ELLs are provided with  word-for-word glossaries for testing accommodations.           6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?           Our ELL-SWDs are exposed to the same educational curriculum/material/resources as our general education  students.  However, in order to provide access to academic content areas and to accelerate English Language Development,  our teachers implement the following: explicit instruction; higher order thinking skills and language development; small group  instruction(during small group instruction, students are exposed to hands on activities, manipulatives, leveled texts using  Literacy Level Intervention (L.L.I); outside resources such as articles; visual aids (charts, pictures, word wall, and smartboard)  and videos. For reading, teachers include strategies like re-reading, chunking of words, letter sounds, stretching of words,  using labels, activating prior knowledge, word association, teaching cognates, and teacher modeling.  Programs such as  Estrellita, the Comprehension Tool Kit by Stephanie Harvey and Literacy Level Intervention by Fountas and Pinnell, are used to  help ELL-Students with Disabilities in their English language development.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?            Our teachers modify and differentiate lessons based on student need.  Methods used by teachers to support ELL-SWDs  are changing the way materials and classroom activities are presented: such as: instructional approaches, differentiation,  scaffolds, manipulatives, hands-on activities, group work, exploration, and incorporating flexible programing into the student's  IEP in order for the student to experience a less restrictive learning environment.  For example, a student in a self-contained  special education class can have a program recommendation to receive SETSS in a general education classroom during  instructional periods.  Lessons are planned using the Common Core Learning Standards with modifications to meet each of the  students' academic needs and IEP goals.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Academic Intervention Services (AIS) are provided to meet the needs of all students who need assistance to meet the Common  Core Learning Standards in ELA and Mathematics. All Grade 3-5 ELL students performing in Levels 1 and 2 and Early Childhood  students deemed to be at risk, will receive appropriately targeted services in English.  The school will be implementing the  following Academic Intervention Services: Comprehension Tool Kit by Stephanie Harvey and Literacy Level Intervention by       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           69      Fountas & Pinnell Intervention Program - Grades 3-5; Do the Math - Grades 3-5; Khan Academy, Amplified Science - Grade  4;  stand-alone and intergrated Reading & Math Services  - Grades 2-5; Children Arts and Science Workshops (CASW) - Grades  K-5;  ENL Enrichment Summer Academy. Lastly, afterschool and Saturday enrichment programs.         9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      During the 2018-2019 school years, we will continue using  continue the Cloud 9 curriculum and Saturday enrichment program  for ENL students based on NYSESLAT data and formative assessments.   The On Our Way to English curriculum will be used for  the lower grades to support students with literacy, language and vocabulary development.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?    As of now, no bilingual programs will be discontinued.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All ELLs are provided the opportunity to participate in all programs available at PS 115M.  There are several after school  programs offered. In the AIS afterschool program, all participating students in grade K-5, including English Language Learners  and Special Education students, are grouped based on assessed needs for additional instruction to support literacy and  mathematic skills.  The Title III ASPIRA Program enables former and current ENL students to enhance, enrich, and extend  literacy skills acquired during the day. English Language Learners will be connecting all the areas of the curriculum while  learning English.  Throughout this program, English Language Learners will have the opportunity to acquire the English  necessary to succeed in social and academic settings.  Students will have multiple opportunities to use discourse and build on  their academic language.  Children Arts and Science Workshops (CASW) is offered to students in grades K-5 Monday through  Friday 2:20-5:30. During the CASW afterschool program, students engage in mathematics, literacy and science skills and hands- on activities.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  During the school years 2017-2019, the school will continue using Engage NY and Teachers College literacy  curriculum's.  Teachers develop learning objectives to meet the specific needs of our ELLs and SWDs. In addition, bilingual  teachers incorporate a language objective to support language, vocabulary and grammar development.  Math is taught using  Engage NY in the monolingual and bilingual classes, and Go Math for the special education classes (K-5). Both curriculum's are  available to students in English or Spanish, depending on the language of instruction within a given classroom.  Go Math  includes sections labeled intervention,  enrichment,  extra practice, and ELL support as well as differentiation of instruction. In  addition to lessons, students complete weekly math journal tasks and math centers. ENL is taught in all bilingual settings  through the content area.  In grades 3-5, Social Studies and science are embedded within the literacy units of study. Resources  and materials may include, but are not limited to books, periodicals, encyclopedias, notes, and/or action research.  In grades K- 2, social studies and science are taught through trade books and hands-on experiences. All bilingual classrooms have listening  centers equipped with books, tapes, or CDs that support language development and content area instruction.  Some books are  available in the classroom. Technology is infused into all curricular areas through the use of in-classroom computers and IPads,  a self-contained technology enrichment lab, mobile laptop cart on each floor, and a library media center.   Students have  ample opportunities to use technology to demonstrate and support their learning.  We will continue to implement the use of  smart boards and Elmos in all classrooms, including monolingual and transitional bilingual classes to support students.           13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Each transitional bilingual classroom is provided with instructional materials in both English and Spanish.  Cognate charts, word  walls, anchor charts and dictionaries are used to support home language. Classroom libraries are established in both languages  by the bilingual classroom teacher.  Teachers in transitional bilingual classrooms are expected to provide students with  resources in both languages during the instructional day. The ENL teacher uses Spanish trade books ENL strategies and  vocabulary words to support with language development. The ENL teacher also uses student dictionaries, technology, visuals,       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           70         manipulatives and total physical response to support the home language. Lastly, the classroom teacher provides students with  multiple opportunities for students to participate in discourse through the use of turn/talks, group table discussion, debates,  share-outs and whole class discussion. .     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.     PS 115 targets academic language skills appropriate for reading and writing at the elementary level detailed in the Common  Core Learning Standards. Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding and Commanding students are receiving their  corresponding units of study as outlined in the CR Part 154. The minutes required allow for additional lessons in basic  communication/oral skills and for further differentiation in content lessons in Science and Social Studies.  Students learn to  access language and content through rigorous and diverse learning experiences that are aligned to their age, grade, language  proficiency and needs. ELL and SWDs are provided with hands-on differentiated activities in ELA, Math, Science and Social  Studies according to their IEP.         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Although we share a building, we do not share resources to support ELLs.       16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).    Parents of newly enrolled ELLs and their chilren will be invited to tour the school and receive the Parent Handbook before the  beginning of the school year, in order to acclimate themselves to our school community. PS 115 parents are invited to Back to  School Night in the middle of September where teachers and parents meet. Parents learn about the curriculum and  expectations for the year and ways in which they can help their child at home in reading and math. New ELLs who enroll  throughout the school year are invited to participate in the Newcomers group. They will receive daily ENL support during the  ENL instructional period. They are invited to participate in the after-school ASPIRA program.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    We currently do not offer language electives for ELLs       18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   We currently do not have a dual language program.       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Professional development is coordinated by the Administrative Cabinet team, ENL Coordinator, and Magnet team in  collaboration. Professional development sessions are aligned to the school's coherent set of beliefs and the Danielson Rubric  for Teaching with a purpose of meeting the needs of all students. The Administrative Cabinet team meets once a week to  reflect and refine school-based practices and adjust the professional development plans to support teacher needs. In grades K-      2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           71         5 teachers meet weekly during common planning periods to discuss lessons, unit and chapter assessments, data and pacing  calendars. Teachers examine students' work and also plan coherent lessons with a language focus while making content  accessible to students. teachers participate in school and out of school professional development "K through 5 mathematics"  where teachers are expected to turn key information to colleagues and implement during daily instruction. The goal is to  provide teachers with effective learning opportunities to increase students’ performance.  Transitional Bilingual, Bilingual  Special Education and the ENL teachers participate in monthly Bilingual meetings. During the bilingual meetings various topics  are discussed to support teachers with effective instructional practices.  Teachers gain knowledge on how to implement  Project Based Learning activities, Engage New York and Teachers College curriculum's,  scaffold, differentiate and implement  ENL strategies.  Attendance is taken at every workshop and maintained as a record.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.    As a school community, we provide professional development for all teachers and administrators strategically differentiate  Professional development sessions that specifically address best practices for our English Language Learners. The Magnet  team, professional development team and grade team leaders plan different professional development workshops according  to teacher needs. In addition, Bilingual meetings are also scheduled each month for grades K-5 bilingual teachers.  In these PDs  we focus on effective enl strategies, intergrating language and content instruction for our ENL population. Teachers also  participate in house and off-site workshops and are required to turn-key this information to their colleagues during weekly  professional development sessions.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   PS 115 provides annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals for the year, their child's language  development progress and their assessment results according to the NYSESLAT taken in the Spring. Parent letters are  distributed in English and Spanish in the beginning of the school year notifying parents of their child's entitlement or non- entitlement in receiving ELL services or if their child reached a commanding level on the NYSESLAT. Translation services of all  documents are provided in the parent's preferred language.     2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Each year, the school's Parent Environmental Survey is carefully evaluated by several members of the School Leadership  Team.  They identify various areas in which parents expressed concerns and the team determined that parents needed to be  made more aware of certain policies and procedures in our community.  Workshops are classified in accordance to students'  needs.  For example, parents of ELLs are invited to workshops about resources in the community such as library, immigration  services, and community agencies.  In addition, other areas are being addressed through workshops, planned and organized by  the school’s PTA.  Another survey will go out to all parents in March that will be evaluated and used to plan additional  workshops and events for parents in our school. Our parent coordinator organizes different workshops in the areas of math,  literacy and instructional strategies on how to support student learning at home. Translation services plan is available for our  non-English speaking parents. It is a plan that assists parents in their preferred language in order to support shared parent- school accountability, parent access to information about their child’s educational options, and parent’s capacity to improve  their child’s achievement.               2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           72      Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Boris Consuegra, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.            2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           74                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Alexander  Humboldt  School                                                                              School DBN: 06/115  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      The data and methodologies used to assess our school's written translation and oral interpretation are as follows:    During the ELL identification process the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) is administered. This  includes an interview with the student and parent to determine the home language.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           76      * Parents fill out the language preference form indicating language preferences.    * Home Language Report (RHLA) is reviewed to identify the different languages within the school.    * The increase in the number of students and families that are Spanish and Arabic speaking, such as newly  admitted ELLs are clear indicators of the need for translation and interpretation services in Spanish and Arabic.    * As part of the school's CEP and planning with the School Leadership Team, the school addresses the language  assistance needs as follows:    Regular and timely provision of translated documents through existing resources within the school or the  Translation and Interpretation Unit. Timely provision of interpretation services at group and one-on-one meetings  upon request when such services are necessary for parents to communicate with teachers, guidance counselors,  school nurse and/or other school staff regarding important information about their child's education. The  budgetary and staffing resources are used to fulfill those needs in compliance with the notification requirements  in Section VII of Chancellor's Regulation- A-663.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     Language    Written Preferred    Percent Written    Oral Preferred    Percent Oral    The large percentage of  students are from Spanish  speaking households.  Through the language  preference forms parents  have indicated that there  is a great need to provide  language assistance  (translation and  interpretation services).  We also have a growing  population of Arabic  families. In order to help  our families, we ensure  that information is  offered in their home  language. The findings are  reported to the school  community through  Parent meetings,  workshops and School  Leadership Team  Meetings, at the time in  which parents fill out a  Language Preference  Form.
