This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   P. S. 32 is committed to academic excellence by creating highly creative, divergent thinkers through a rigorous and  integrated educational experience aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards. A partnership with families  fosters a positive relationship between our school and the home. Every member of the school community will acquire  all of the skills necessary to be a successful life-long learner, open to limitless possibilities and prepared for the  challenges of a unique and diverse society. At our school, we believe that each student comes with an individual name  tag. Through the appropriate instruction and enrichment of innate talents, students will meet high standards and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      reach their ultimate personal and academic potential. Respect and acceptance of each individual is at the heart of  what we do. At our school, every child will excel.          2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    PS 32 is a Pre K-5 school, located in a middle class community in Flushing, New York. This school serves a population  of approximately 990 students from culturally diverse backgrounds.       The school received a “Well Developed” on all indicators on the most recent Quality Review. As stated in the Quality  Review. “The principal and staff foster a community that provides students with a nurturing environment that  highlights student accomplishments leading to positive student behaviors and an enthusiasm for learning.”       PS 32 supports a Dual Language Korean Program, which is the only program of its kind on the east coast of the United  States. The program began with only kindergarten in 2006 and now includes classes up to the fifth grade. The  instruction in this program is 50% in English and 50% in Korean, thus making all children in the program bilingual and  bi-literate in both languages. Teachers of the Dual Language classes meet regularly to plan instruction, create Korean  assessments, and plan the Lunar New Year show which celebrates the Korean culture.    The school currently offers a New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) Gifted and Talented Program for  kindergarten - grade five students. This program is designed to support the needs of exceptional students. The Gifted  and Talented program delivers rigorous and specialized instruction, aligned to Common Core Learning Standards.   PS 32 has a highly structured professional development plan. The second Monday of each month, using the Inquiry  Cycle, teachers meet with their grade to analyze student work and then brainstorm lessons or strategies to teach a  group of students based on the data. During the third Monday of each month, school wide vertical teams meet to  analyze data and recognize trends across grades. For example, the Literacy Vertical Teams look at the traits across all  grades using the English Language Arts (ELA) Standards and the 5 Pillars of Reading to pinpoint the gaps that exist  between each of the grades. Vertical Teams also share their work with the entire school on the PS 32’s Shutterfly  account. Professional learning happens as a whole staff on the first and fourth Mondays of the month.   PS 32 is a Teachers College Focus School for balanced literacy instruction school-wide. The Teachers College  professional development model at PS 32 includes grade level meetings and often grade level lab sites where specific  strategies and pedagogy are modeled by the Teachers College Staff Developer and then practiced by the classroom  teachers. In addition, teachers attend the professional development offered by Teachers College. During the 2013- 2014 school year, we implemented the Go Math Program. The Math Vertical team continues to examine the program  and analyze tasks to be embedded into the lesson to lift the level of discourse and instruction. Words Their Way  Phonics program is being used in all grades. In addition, kindergarten is implementing the Fundations Program. The  FOSS Science Program is used in grades K, 1 and 2. Harcourt Brace Science Program is used in grades 3, 4 and 5. These  are research-based science curricula that engage students in active investigation and hands on learning opportunities  guided by principles of the scientific method. Students engage in guided inquiry to discover scientific principles and  construct meaning by developing questions, designing experiments, and making observations .       PS 32 understands that we teach the “whole child”. Through our Enrichment Club Program, teachers teach a subject  or interest that they are passionate about and students are given the opportunity to engage in interest-based,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      enjoyable and challenging learning experiences. Students in grades K-5 may choose among such clubs as drama,  dance, arts and crafts, enriched science, sports, chess, quilting, jewelry making, costume and set design, cheerleading,  yoga, martial arts, comic book making, etc.      The Student Council meets during this time with a staff advisor to plan charitable events. Through the Peer Mediation  Program, students in grades 4 and 5 learn skills to help students mediate conflict. The Student of the Month  recognizes individual achievement in academic areas as well as social skills. Several grades receive vocal music  instruction from a full time licensed music teacher and grades 4 and 5 have the opportunity to participate in Chorus,  while grade 3 students are learning the recorder. A full time licensed drama teacher and a full time licensed art  teacher ensures that every student receives an enriching theater and/or art education. Technology and library media  are also offered to our students as a part of their cluster programs.      Parents play a significant role in the PS 32 community. The Parent Teacher Association (PTA) is extremely active in  helping plan fun and engaging activities for students and families both during and after school. The PTA provides  activities that are responsive to school needs, including Power Brain as a hands on, kinesthetic method of focusing.  Parent engagement is at the heart of our school community. Parents are frequently invited to celebrate academics  achievement, for example publishing parties, and actively participate in student learning, such as being audience  members of a class debate. The parent coordinator holds a monthly Sidewalk Cafe that offers planned events for  parents as well as an opportunity for parents to discuss issues and concerns of importance to them.         3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   At PS 32, all students are special and are treated as such. In keeping true to our mission and vision, all students have  specific needs and instruction must be customized accordingly. Therefore, the needs of these students is what  dictates for us how to create the child's Individualized Educational Plan (IEP) to provide the optimal services and  supports for that child. Currently, students with IEPs receive anything from related services (i.e-Speech, Occupational  Therapy (OT), Physical Therapy (PT), Counseling, Hearing Services, etc.), flexible programming (i.e-self contained  setting for ELA and ICT for all other subjects), mainstreaming (where a student is in a self contained class for most  subjects and then goes to a larger setting for subjects of strength), self contained or Inclusive Collaborative Teaching  (ICT) settings. We are fluid in our programming to accommodate student needs and ensure that children are being  serviced in the least restrictive environment to the greatest extent possible.       According to Part-154 all students are provided with a Home Language Identification form to complete upon their  entrance into a NYCDOE school. If a child speaks other than English at home, the family then views a video on ENL  support services to select a way for delivery of this service. At this time, our identified English Language Learners  receive their mandated service by one of four ENL teachers pushing in or pull out students to provide ENL services, or  they are students of our free standing Korean Dual Language class, where the classroom teacher provides the ENL  instruction.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The Framework for Great Schools, emphasizes the importance of rigorous instruction, supportive environment,  collaborative teachers, effective school leadership, strong family-community ties and trust all working together for  the optimum success of a school. Our school is built on trust, which is evidenced by the positive responses of both   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      staff and families resulting in a 4.29 for the overall trust (parent-teacher, teacher-administration, teacher-teacher,  parent-administration) on the 2016-2017 Quality Guide.       While we pride ourselves in building strong family community ties, based on the School Survey of 2016-2017 85% of  parents who completed the survey responded that they are somewhat or very likely to attend a general school  meeting or school event,below the citywide and district average. Therefore, we must work at providing more  purposeful, supportive workshops or meetings that families are likely to attend. Additionally, our instructional focus,  based on Measures of Teacher Practice (MOTP), PPO feedback and responses to rigorous instruction questions on the  school survey, has been developed to "Grow a deeper understanding of the nuances and the increasing complexity of  national standards across grades. To build pedagogical awareness of strategies that align with the skill trajectory for  each of the standards."               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 25Q032   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   980   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   YES   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

After spending the 2017-2018 school year focusing on embedding the 8 mathematical practices into daily  instruction, our overall math proficency on the grades 3, 4 and 5 NYS Math Assessment increased from 72% to 74%  (Levels 3 and 4), back to where it was in the 2016.    2. The percent of students earning a level 4 on the NYS Math assessment in grades 4 and 5 has decreased over a three  year period. In 2016, Grade 5 was at 50% of students achieving a Level 4, in 2017 Grade 5 was at 37% level 4, and in  2018, the same grade had 43% achieving at level 4. As a school we have spent the past year (2017-2018) examining  how we embed the mathematical practices into our daily instruction, which supported the growth from 37 to 43%  Level 4s, however, we know that two years prior 50% of students scored a level 4, so we know something further has  to be done . While we have created more rigorous tasks and stepped away from the Go Math curriculum verbatim,  we are noticing that there are still gaps in our instructional continuum when teaching mathematics and students are  struggling with conceptual understanding. We have decided that we need to increase mathematical talk in order for  students to think through the math they are working on. If students have more time to construct meaning through  talk they will have a more solid understanding of future concepts being taught. We have also seen a decrease when  examining the trends on the NYS math assessment over a three year period (2015-2017). Additionally, we continued  to look further at our math data, noticing that the majority of our level 1 students are either SWD or ELLs (including  former ELLs) and these same students scored poorly on the speaking part of the NYSESLAT assessment for the same  year. This solidified that we need to do more work with oral rehearsal and increasing the opportunity for students to  talk across content areas, to help them better comprehend the content.    3. Based on 2017-2018 Mathematical Inquiry focus, more time is needed to fully implement math tasks across the  school, however we could begin to build in more talk in the mathematics classroom through the use of routines daily.  This conversation with our focus on mathematics, than got us thinking about talk across curriculum areas.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.  By June 2019, through professional learning cycles, teachers will grow content knowledge in mathematics in order to  effectively implement mathematical routines daily. Implementation of these routines will help students understand and  trust that productive struggle is necessary to learn and that by incorporating discourse thinking will shift from a  procedural to a conceptual understanding of mathematics. This will result in a 3% proficiency increase on the 2018-2019  NYS Math Assessment.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          20     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional  development, and/or systems and structures needed  to impact change.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37        State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38           Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS 32Q , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      PS 32Q will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g.,ESSA/State accountability  system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning  Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

This program was designed based on a data  analysis of the NYSESLAT, MoSL Assessments and baseline ELL Assessments. We examined  data from the ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT). These data sources reveal that speaking is a  modality of strength across in grades 3, 4 and 5 and, according to the EDAT, writing was the  modality of need for most NYSESLAT test takers.  An analysis of the NYS Performance  Beginning of the Year Assessment (MoSL) indicated a weakness in writing in response to a  prompt based on complex text, particularly informational text. The baseline ELL assessments  showed that even students who were at the expanding level overall on the NYSESLAT were at  the emerging and transitioning levels on the constructed responses of the baseline assessment  because  their responses lacked complex sentences and academic vocabulary. The implications  of this analysis are that the afterschool enrichment program will provide targeted instruction in  academic language so that students will be able to read and respond to demanding, complex text  across subject areas. This program, taught by licensed ENL teachers, will be offered to 85  students in grades 2-5 (in grade 2 - 15 students, in grade 3 - 32 students, in grade 4 - 20 students,  in grade 5 -  18 students) and will take place on Wednesday and Thursday afternoons from 2:20  pm to 3:50 pm from February 6, 2019 to March 28, 2019. The activities will be designed to  develop Tier 2 vocabulary (academic language) through deconstruct/reconstruct strategies, juicy  sentences, vocabulary word play, and math tasks. Materials will include getting "Ready for the  NYSESLAT and Beyond", "NYS Progress Coach ELA", "Buckle Down in Mathematics", trade  books, and teacher made material. These materials are supplemental and distinct from those used  for daily instruction. Students will be grouped by grade and language proficiency. In addition,  ENL teachers will meet one hour each week to share best practices in ELL instruction and to  plan curriculum. In order to support the Korean Dual Language Program, Korean trade books  will be purchased. Parents will be notified of the program in their home language and copies will  be maintained.  The administrator will create the classes, supervise instruction, and maintain  attendance records and student portfolio. This is the only program operating in the school during  this extended time.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48         Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.     rationale  teachers to receive training          schedule and duration      name of provider   topics to be covered   Begin description here:              Teaching experts, (Literacy coach, ENL specialists, IEP teacher, SETSS teachers, science  clusters and social studies liaisons) will provide classroom teachers with professional  development on using targeted instruction to address the needs of ELLs. ENL teachers and Dual  Language teachers in the Title III program will participate in a study group to examine curricula,  classroom teaching strategies, and assessments to improve student learning. In addition, teachers  will participate in professional development to enable ELL students to develop Tier 2 vocabulary  (academic language). This professional development will be based on the research of Dr. Lily  Wong Fillmore and Maryann Cucchiara including topics such as: deconstruct/reconstruct  strategies, juicy sentences, vocabulary word play. Research has shown that developing academic  vocabulary will positively impact the progress of ELLs. This professional development will be  provided by ENL specialists (including ENL teachers and Dual language teachers who  participate in the title III program) and Queens North Field Support specialist support. Classroom  teachers and specialists will continue to meet once a month during the professional development  period on Mondays between 2:20 pm – 4:15 pm. Professional development also takes place  across grades once a month on Mondays between 2:20 pm and 4:15 pm. In addition, ENL  teachers meet with Vertical Teams in literacy, math, science and social studies to work on  infusing ELL strategies into content area instruction. These teams meet monthly on Monday  from 2:20 pm - 4:15 pm. The supervisor of the program will maintain agendas and attendance  sheets for PD.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  TCRWP is the assessment tool our school uses to assess the early literacy skills of ELLs. Based on Fountas and Pinnell reading  levels:  Grade 1 - 35%  ELL students are performing at Level 1, 47% of ELL students are performing at Level 2, 11% of ELL  students are performing at Level 3 and 5% of ELL students are performing at Level 4.  Grade 2 - 57% of ELL students are  performing at Level 1, 14% ELL students are performing at Level 2 and 28% of ELL students are perfroming at Level 3. Grade  3-  71% of  ELL students are performing at Level 1 and 29% of  ELL students are performing at Level 2. Grade 4 - 42% 61% ELL  students are performing at Level 1 and 58% of ELL students are performing at Level 2. Grade 5 66% of ELL students are  performing at Level 1 and 33% of ELL students are performing at Level 2. The results are similar for all ELL students, whether  they are in the ENL free standing program or the dual language program. Running Records data also indicates that for ELLs  fluency is often acquired before comprehension. This insight helps inform the school’s instructional plan by indicating that   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         vocabulary development and development of higher level thinking skills are vital for developing early literacy skills for ELLs.  Instruction focuses on shared reading of complex text to improve comprehension skills. Therefore, emphasis is placed on  comprehension skills during all content area instruction for ELLs.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Professional Learning Teams on each grade meet monthly to participate in the inquiry process to analyse the results of the  formative assessments, to review student work, and to plan instruction for all students including ELLs based on the  data learned from these assessments. Vertical teams meet to ensure continuity across grades. The vertical teams also  participate in professional development with TC staff developers to support this effort.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  NYC Performance tasks ELA, MYC Performance Tasks Math, ELL Periodic Assessments, Korean HLA Assessment, Imagine  Leaning, Raz kids, DIBELS, Study Island, GoMath beginning and end of year assessment, TC running records     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Pupil Personnel Team and the Academic Support Team meet monthly to analyze the results of the summative data and plan  interventions to address the needs of students, including ELLS. ENL teachers are members of these teams to help interpret the  data and share interventions specific to meet the needs of ELLs.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   ELLs take part in RTI screening to assess whether literacy skills and competencies are meeting grade level benchmarks. If an  ELL is identified as at-risk or below-benchmark on a particular skill or competency, the student receives targeted instructional  support to improve in that area. This support is delivered in coordination with language support services. Progress is  monitored to make decisions about changes in goals and instruction.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   NYSELAT, NYS English Language Arts assessment, NYS Math assessment.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The data specialist disseminates an Item Analysis report to all teachers. The principal, ENL teachers, AIS teacher and IEP  teacher analyze this data to plan programs based on needs of students, including ELLs. The ELL Data Analysis Tool and the RLAT  from ATS are analyzed by the ENL teachers, the Dual Language teachers and the IEP and AIS teachers to look for trends and  target individual at risk students.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   In the freestanding ENL program, students are grouped as a block with mixed proficiency levels. ENL teachers push in  to classes to provide the  mandated minutes of both integrated and stand alone ENL.

These students require additional assistance to meet state standards in ELA, mathematics,  science, and social studies. They are provided with targeted instruction in listening, speaking, reading and writing. Classroom  teachers and ENL teachers tailor instruction based on the SIFE’s individual assessed needs. SIFEs receive targeted instruction in  the content areas. Intensive guidance services are provided to assist SIFEs who experience affective domain issues that impact  on their ability to achieve academically.  A plan is in place for newcomers. Parents of newcomers are consulted to determine the extent of education in the home  language and the students’ previous exposure to English. Classroom teachers of newcomers are provided with training and  materials that best serve the needs of these students. This training includes methods of adapting core curricula for use with  newcomers. Peer Language Buddies and Learning Leaders are assigned to further assist newcomers. Newcomers receive  preparation for the ELA exam to familiarize them with the language and format of the assessment and to teach them test  taking strategies.  Academic intervention services are provided to meet the needs of developing ELLs  who require additional assistance to  acquire academic language necessary to meet the  in English Language arts, mathematics, science, and social studies. Intensive  guidance and support services are provided to assist long term ELLs who are experiencing affective domain issues that impact  on their ability to achieve academically. Developing ELLs participate in an at-risk resource room program, at-risk guidance,  and/or at-risk speech and language. Our Youth and Family Service Coordinator provides substance abuse and intervention  services. An after school test prep program provide additional support to these ELLs. Our ENL teachers, speech and language  teacher, resource room teachers, and literacy coaches push into classrooms with targeted ELLs to reduce student teacher  ratios and provide teachers with strategies to differentiate instruction.  In addition, RTI interventions are provided to meet the needs of Long Term ELLs.  Long tern ELLS receive  intense research  based programs in a group of no greater than 3 students. These programs may include: Wilson, Fundations, Great Leaps,  Voyager Passport, Orton Gillingham,  Explode the Code and Scott Foresman Reading Street.  A plan is in place for former ELLs in years one and two after exiting ELL status. These students are clustered in the classes  where they continue to receive ENL/ELA or other content area instruction by an ENL teacher 90 minutes a week. ENL teachers  work with classroom teachers to provide differentiated instruction to meet the needs of former ELL students. These students  continue to receive test accomodations on state and classroom exams.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   A plan is in place for ELL-SWDs that provides access to academic content areas and accelerates English language development.  SETSS teachers, classroom teachers, and ENL teachers collaborate to plan instruction. Instruction for these students is  modified according to individual assessed needs.

List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math and other curriculum areas include an at-risk resource room program, at- risk guidance, and/or at-risk speech and language. Our Youth Development Coordinator provides substance abuse and  intervention services. An after school test prep program provide additional support to these ELLs. Our ENL teachers, speech  and language teachers, SETSS teachers, and literacy coaches push into classrooms during ELA, math, and othe content  area  instruction with targeted ELLs to reduce student teacher ratios and provide teachers with strategies to differentiate  instruction. These programs are homogenously grouped by proficiency levels. These programs are offered in English and  Korean where possible.        9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      PS 32 has begun enrichment clubs. These clubs are based on student interest and choice. The clubs are organized across  grades and include ELL students at different proficiency levels. This affords many opportunities for oral language  development.  We noticed that ELL students and students with disabilities were were making slower progress toward meeting  grade level standards in reading and writing.as compared to general education students. Up the Ladder, a program  that modifies the Teachers College Reading and Writing Program to meet the needs of ELL students and students with  disabilities, is being used.     10.

How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   In the Korean Dual Language Program, home language support is delivered 50% of the time. In the freestanding ENL program,  home language support is provided through glossaries, translators and language buddies.          14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Support services and resources correspond to ELLs’ age and grade levels.  ENL teachers work closely with teachers in the  following grade bands: Kindergarten, grades 1 & 2, grades 3, and grades 4-5 to ensure that services  and resources are grade  and age appropriate.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Ps 32 doers not share a building with any other school or program.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Kindergarten parents and students attend an orientation in June before children begin school. They are given strategies to help  their children before the beginning of the school year. Translators attend these meetings. At the orientation meeting for  parents of newly enrolled ELL students, which is held in September, parents are given strategies to to further assist their child.  These orientations continue as new ELL students are admitted throughout the school year.  The ELL Coordinator, the ENL  teachers and the Dual Language teachers facilitate these meetings and orientations,     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    NA      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   A self contained dual language model is used. 50% of the time the target language, Korean, is used for  EPs and ELLS in each grade. EPs and ELLs are integrated all day. All content areas are taught together. This  includes reading, writing, mathematics, science, social studies, art, drama, computer, physical education,  and music. English and Korean are used to teach core content on alternating days. Emergent literacy is  taught in both languages simultaneously.       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  All teachers, including classroom teachers, other teaching personnel and paraprofessionals, are provided with extensive  professional development opportunities in supporting ELLs as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards. ENL  teachers articulate principles of effective instruction for ELLs. Teachers examine curricula and classroom teaching strategies to  improve student learning. In addition, ENL and Dual Language teachers participate in professional development to enable ELL  students to develop Tier 2 vocabulary (academic language). This professional development is based on the research of Dr. Lily  Wong Fillmore including such topics as: deconstruct/reconstruct strategies, juicy sentences, vocabulary word play, and close   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         reading of complex text. These strategies are shared with classroom teachers by ENL specialists. Our literacy coach and  Teachers College staff developers provide professional development on balanced literacy, including the reading/writing  workshop model. Our professional development includes lab sites on each grade where our staff developers model lessons  and demonstrate strategies to differentiate instruction and provide academic interventions for ELLs.  In addition, ENL and  classroom teachers attend calendar days at Teachers College which emphasize balanced literacy techniques for use with ELL  students. These teachers then provide ongoing professional development at weekly professional development. During these  periods, teachers are also taught techniques for modifying instruction in the content areas for ELLs. Borough Field Support  Specialists will provide professional development to classroom teachers, ENL teachers and paraprofessionals on strategies to  use with ELL students in all subject areas. Math lead teachers (upper grades and primary grades) provide professional  development on ways to provide ELL students with multiple entry points to the math lesson. The ENL teachers also provide  professional development on strategies to modify instruction in GO Math. Dual language and ENL teachers will  receive  additional professional development from Borough Field Support Specialists. Curriculum Verical Teams meet monthly with  representatives of each grade and out of classroom personnel including ENL teachers and special education teachers, to align  curriculum in all content areas for all students, including ELL students and students with disabilities.        2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  The ENL teachers and the guidance counselor plan professional development for the staff to assist ELL students as they  transition to middle school.  Middle school choices are explained to staff, students and parents. Staff, students and parents are  invited to middle school orientations.        A minimum of 15% of the required professional development hours for all teachers are dedicated to language acquisition,  including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for ELLs. For all  Dual language and ELL teachers, 50% of the required professional development hours are dedicated to language acquisition in  alignment with core content area instruction, including a focus on best practices on co-teaching strategies and integrating  language and content instruction for ELLs.  Supervisors review professional development schedules and records, including  agendas, attendance and minutes. These documents are kept in a binder in the Principal's office.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Annual indivual meetings with parent/guardians of ELLS are held onTuesday afternoons at 2:20 pm, or at any other convenient  time for the parent, throughout the school year. The purpose of these meetings is to discuss for the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all contact areas.  Interpretation and tranlation is provided as needed. These meetings are in addition to parent orientation meetings and  November and March parent-teacher conferences. Records of these meetings are kept in the ELL office along with evidence of  outreach to ensure parent needs are accomodated.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   The Parent Coordinator and guidance counselor provide outreach for parents of ELLs and serve as resources for parents and  parent organizations. They maintain materials in different languages that can assist parents in understanding all school services  and programs, including ENL services and programs. PS 32 has a very active PTA. The PTA Executive Board consists of parents  who speak Korean, Chinese, and Spanish. These parents attend every PTA meeting and parent events and translate as needed.  The PTA actively recruits parents of ELL students to participate in school events. There are class parents in every class who  reach out to all parents, including parents of ELL students.

Written and oral translations are provided in the most  dominant languages of Korean, Spanish, and Chinese of documents such as PTA notices, open school invitations, and activity  announcements. Translators attend parent workshops, special events and parent-teacher conferences. Additional languages  are translated when necessary and possible.     An orientation session and a workshop for parents of ELLs take place each year in September. Topics at the orientation  include the state standards, assessments, school expectations, and general requirements for the ESL and dual language  programs. At the workshop, ENL teachers discuss how parents of ELLs can become more effective partners in their children’s  education. The ENL teachers explain strategies that the parents can use to help their children with homework, vocabulary  development, literacy, math, social studies and science, and how to effectively communicate with their children’s teachers.  The Principal, Assistant Principal, Parent Coordinator and a representative from the P.T.A. participate in this meeting.  Translators are provided. Additional orientations are ongoing as new ELLS enroll during the school year.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Debra Errico, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:                                                                                   School DBN: 25Q032  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
