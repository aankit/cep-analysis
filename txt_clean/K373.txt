This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      The mission of our school is to maximize the greatest degree of independence and to secure optimal post-secondary  placements for each of our students through individualized academic preparation and authentic work experiences  that are commensurate to their abilities and interests. We strive to provide an inclusive learning environment that is  highly collaborative, enriching and creative. We work with families and community-based organizations to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      concentrate upon educating the “whole child” so they are prepared for an adulthood that is productive, healthy and  meaningful and allows them to fully participate in their community.       2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    The Brooklyn Transition Center (BTC), P373K is a Special Education District 75 High School that serves students  identified with Learning Disabilities, Emotional Disturbance, Intellectual Disabilities and Autism.   Our school has strategically created 5 distinct student cohorts that focus on student learning needs and are not  population or ratio specific. The five cohorts are structured teaching, service learning, pre-transition, inclusion and  transition. Students in the pre-transition cohort receive “real-life training” experiences in preparation for full-time  transition worksites. The learning labs include a print shop, a laundry center, a supermarket, a bike shop, a recycling  center, a community garden, a culinary prep center, a tech and multimedia center, a Goodwill store and a CVS  "mock" store. In addition, a new partnership was formed with our community neighbor, Acumen Capital Partners,  where students work in various start-up industries throughout their building. We also began a collaboration with  ADAPT Day Habilitation Center in addition to our partnership with AHRC.   A unique class, TASC (Test Assessing Secondary Completion), that offers courses that provide the opportunity to gain  a GED diploma was developed in conjunction with District 79. One of our students gained his GED this year, a first for  our school!    This year, The Brooklyn Transition Center was honored to present a workshop at the ASCD Educator's conference  about our collaboration with the Southside Occupational Academy in Chicago on Transitional Planning for Students  with Disabilities.   Transitional planning begins as soon as students enter our school. Transition teachers and school-based staff  collaborate to develop and implement an individualized transition plan for each student that realistically identifies  post-secondary goals. This early collaboration addresses a myriad of needs to ensure student independence and  proper placement. This includes establishing eligibility with the Office of People With Developmental Disabilities  (OPWDD), which is the “gateway” to agency connections, completion of various psychological evaluations, securing  medical and socio-emotional services, and, finally, finding an appropriate adult placement for the student. The  teachers address the issues necessary to implement each goal so that each student receives the support needed to  achieve his or her desired outcomes and become productive members of his or her community. Transition work sites  include hospitals, colleges, day-care centers, senior centers, and a teacher's aide program. We promote self-advocacy  at the school and have a Student Empowerment advocacy group.   In order to support our focus on earlier transitional planning, the school has implemented the Carrie Rose National  Teacher/Home Visit Project for the past two years. The project has supported teachers in connecting with the  families of our students of autism outside of the classroom. This year, we joined the Parent Teacher Home Visit  program and continued our collaborations with families. In the next school year, the program will be expanded to  include other populations. These connections allow for the development of person centered plans, as well as  targeted parent outreach and training programs.   We continue to have a strong focus on health. The fifth year of our "Healthy New You" program included students'  participation in Mighty Milers, a Self Care Fair, a Wellness Fair, a Mindfullness Day, Cookshop classes, health  coaching, pregnancy prevention classes and participation in Special Olympics. In addition, one of our teachers held  weekly LBGT student seminars. This year, we received a $25,000 grant from the Wallentas Foundation that allowed  us to create a sensory room and we formed a new collaboration with Special Olympics that enabled us build a state   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      of the art weight lifting and work out room. We also received funding from Action for Healthy Kids, the Office of  School Wellness, Grow NYC, and Citibike memberships for our students.   We have expanded our after-school programs to include CHAMPS athletics programs, AHRC after-school program,  Title III, ILC and MSAS. Students participated in after-school CHILL programs including skateboarding, snowboarding  and surfing. The school worked with Gallop NYC to teach students to care for and ride horses. New alliances were  also formed with Brooklyn Botanical Gardens and the Brooklyn Museum.   There is a strong focus on the arts at the school, including visual arts, printmaking, music, dance, drama and  videography. This year, the school produced an original full length musical production of "Motown and performed for  the New York City Teaching Fellows at Kings Theater.   Another addition to our school this year is our lovable dog, "Doolittle" - the school's new adoption, as part of the  Comfort Dog program. Classes learn to care for him and he provides love to both the students and the staff.            3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   All students participate in New York State Alternate Assessment (NYSAA) and have Individualized Education Plans  (IEPs) with academic, social and vocational goals. They receive a full continuum of IEP mandated services. Our student  ratios include 12:1:1, 8:1:1 and 6:1:1 designations. Emphasis is placed on data-based differentiated instruction using  assessment tools including, Vocational Level I, SANDI, Scantron and IEP Tracking sheets to meet the needs of  individual students. A standards- based curriculum that is aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards and the  Career Development and Occupational Studies Standards (CDOS) is implemented throughout the school and is  designed to be hands-on and experiential. Technology is infused in all areas to support classroom instruction and to  increase student learning. Students are assessed through SANDI testing.         4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The 2017 - 2018 Quality School Guide snapshot indicated a Framework Element score of 4.14 for Effective Principal  Leadership, up from 3.88; 4.50 for Collaborative Teachers, an increase from 4.13; and 3.81 in Trust, an increase from  3.44. Areas of focus for the coming school year are in the areas of Strong Family Ties, where there was a slight  decrease from 3.55 to 3.43 and in Supportive Environment, where there was a drop from 3.59 to 3.41.   SANDI scores in the 2016-2017 school year showed a 4.36% increase in ELA and a 2.25% increase in math in the  structured teaching cohort.   This year, we were a Learning Partners Host school. Utilizing the Learning Partners Model of Cycles of Learning and  the Chancellors Shared Practices to Success model, we worked with our partner schools to refine instructional  practices to maximize post-secondary outcomes. Through the Teacher Leaders Program (TLP), we were afforded the  opportunity to further refine our leadership infrastructure and practices of teacher peer-to-peer support through  inter-visitations and select professional development opportunities. In addition, this year our "Para Advisory  Committee" began a "buddy program" between more experienced paraprofessionals and new staff in order to  provide increased instructional and career support for our paraprofessionals.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      On the most recent 2014-15 Quality Review, the school received 4 “well developed” in the areas of Ensuring Rigorous  Instruction, Aligning Assessments to Curricula, Establishing a Culture for Learning and Engaging in Professional  Collaborations. The area of Developing Teacher Pedagogy was rated “proficient”.       In the 2018-2019 school year, P373K will continue its focus on increasing academic achievement by providing  instruction that is aligned to the Common Core and targeted to the individual learning needs of each student,  including the continued use of System 44 Reading Program. We will expand opportunities for families to participate in  the school community and continue the Home Visit Program in order to improve strong family ties. In addition, we  will participate in Learning Partners for the third year and increase inter-visitations between the schools for a greater  number of teachers. A strong emphasis will be placed on strengthening a supported environment in the school to  improve our social-emotional climate and prevent bullying.                     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 75K373   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   10,11,12,SE   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   432   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   YES   Dual Language   YES   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     The most current Quality Review in (2014-15) states, “to close the achievement gap by increasing the level of  challenge for all students.” To achieve this goal the school will be implementing a curriculum to meet each students  specially designed instruction (SDI) targets based on individual Student Annual Needs Determination Inventory  (SANDI) scores in reading and writing. These instructional targets will be embedded in our ELA curriculum and will be  conveyed through the development of individual “Student Learning Portfolios” (SLP).   (Quality Review Indicators: 1.1 Curriculum, 1.2 Pedagogy, 2.2 Assessment, 3.4 High Expectations, 1.3 Leveraging  Resources, 5.1 Monitoring and Revising Systems)      P373K (BTC) has made considerable gains in providing our students with rigorous, engaging, standards-based  instruction.    As stated in our 2017-18 PPO:   “…You shared that you are looking at how to include a snapshot of the qualitative element in your tracking of student  progress. We discussed that it can look different for each teacher based upon the students they teach, reflected  through photos, videos, work samples, narratives, etc.       An examination of the following SANDI data for 2016-17 indicated the following   ● 6:1:1 – 10.52% overall growth (writing)   ● Service Learning– 4.76 % overall growth (writing)   ● Pre-transition – 2.20 % overall growth (writing)      Based on the above cumulative SANDI scores, our school’s instructional focus will be on writing skill development  using a curriculum derived from Engage NY units of study aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14      Essential Elements. Each students’ authentic writing products will be assessed using SANDI, the “Writing Continuum”  and Individual Student Learning Portfolios. These assessment tools will demonstrate student skill development, while  allowing for teachers to create meaningful instructional activities customized for each learner’s specially designed  instructional goals.      Scantron will be used with students who require more rigorous instruction.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  In order to support students as they transition into adulthood and plan their individualized post-secondary goals, we  encourage students to join groups and participate in school-wide events e.g. Student Empowerment Group, Young  Boys and Girls Club, CHAMPS, Middle School Afterschool Program (MSAS), Title III Afterschool Program, CHILL,  Rowing, Student Government, Debate Team, Sewing and Craft Club, Evening Dances, Kindness Project, Healthy New  You, Anti-Bullying Project, and the annual school musical production. This activities [provide a great opportunity for  students to engage in interest-driven activities which can transfer to adulthood. The initial PPO for the 2017-2018  school year stated, "Your program alignment to student needs and teacher expertise is designed to promote career  readiness and meaningful post-secondary outcomes for all students".   Therapeutic Crisis Intervention Services (TCIS) trained staff members respond effectively to students in need by  establishing a safe environment and promoting individualized strategies for student growth and development. Forty- seven percent of P373K staff members have received the four-day TCIS training. The Therapeutic Crisis Intervention  Services (TCIS) Room serves as a prevention and intervention area designed to help students learn constructive ways  to handle crises. Specifically, bullying as the reason for referral to the TCIS room dropped 35% between 2015-2016.   SWIS data indicates a significant decrease in challenging behaviors. Specifically, data shows a 9% drop in referrals to  the TCIS room for services between 2015-2016 and 2016 - 2017 and a 10% drop in referrals to the TCIS room for  services between 2016-2017 and 2017 - 2018.   OORS data indicates a drop in school incidents. Thirty-six incidents were reported in 2016-2017 and 29 were reported  in 2017-2018, revealing a a six point drop.    P373K has six Guidance Counselors and two school Psychologists that are available to support students. Additionally  each classroom has, at least, one paraprofessional.   Our PBIS room provides a safe, responsive environment for students to self-regulate negative behavior, on an as- needed basis.   In order to establish a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their  teachers and peers we will address the issue of bullying. The results of the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide indicate  that 54% of students responded positively in the area of bullying prevention, which is 17% less than the city average.  P373K plans to offer additional programs, increase the percentage of TCIS trained staff, decrease SWIS referrals,  decrease OORS reporting, and increase support staff and bullying prevention programs.      Our Student Government Organization (SGO) tackles the issue of bullying for the month of October, which is   National Bullying Prevention Month, at weekly student seminars. They also spearheaded the Anti-Bullying  Project.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          19        According to the National Bullying Prevention Center bullying affects a students ability to learn. Many   students with disabilities are already addressing challenges in their academic environment. When they are  bullied, it can directly impact their education. Bullying is not a harmless right of childhood that many  experience. Research shows that bullying can negatively impact a child's access to education and lead to:  school avoidance, higher rates of absenteeism, decrease in grades, inability to concentrate, loss of interest in  academic achievement, and an increase in dropout rates.      According to ncps.org, nearly 43% of kids have been bullied online.     The text in Disabilities: Insights from Across Fields and Across the World reports that students with disabilities   are much more likely to be bullied than their non-disabled peers. Although only ten U.S. studies have been  conducted on the connection between bullying and developmental disabilities, all of these studies found that  children with disabilities were two to three times more likely to be bullied than their non-disabled peers.     The British Journal of Learning Support indicates that 60% of students with disabilities report being bullied   regularly, compared with 25% of all students.      The 2017-2018 NYC School Report Card rating in "Preventing Bullying" states that 54% of students report   being harassed, bullied or feeling intimidated at their school. While this is 17% less than is reported across city  schools, students have the right to come to school feeling safe and secure so that they will be in the highest  positive mental state in order to learn. This need indicates the need to strengthen programs that will enhance  school culture and offer as supportive an environment as possible.    To ensure we are supporting the whole child each student has an Individualized Educational Plan (IEP). In addition to  that P373K is developing a system of Portfolio Assessments that will cater to the individual growth of each student.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  By June 2019, through the continuation of the "Respect for All" program, students reporting bullying will be  reduced by 5% as measured by NYC School Quality Guide.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          20     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.

Indicate the data trends, source and year.    According to the 2017 - 2018 School Quality Guide, in the area of Collaborative Teachers, 88% of teachers felt   they “had opportunities to work productively with colleagues at their on school professional development.”    Under the category of Peer to Peer Collaboration in the 2017-18 School Quality Guide, 95% of teachers say   they "talk with one another about instruction."     According to indicator 4.2 in the school's last Quality Review (2014-15): "Teacher teams engage in      collaborative inquiry that supports goals and strengthens teacher capacity."   Indicator 4.2 of the Quality Review (2014-15) also states that "Teachers take on a variety of leadership roles in  the school and collaborate to examine student work, plan together and visit each other's classroom to share  ideas and best practices."      During participation in the DOE's Learning Partners Program, three administrators and four teachers had the   opportunity to engage in monthly school to school inter visitations and professional development sessions.  Staff used this opportunity to develop a school-based student/teacher inter visitation program called 'The  Buddy Project", linking students in 6:1:1 and 12:1:1 classes and their teachers to share vocational and  instructional experiences and best practices. 10% of our 6:1:1 students participated, and 5% of our 12:1:1  population.      While many teachers participate in school based inter visits, according to the 2017 - 2018 School Quality   Guide, only 84% of teachers say that other teachers are eager to try new ideas within the school.     The 2017-18 School Quality Guide also indicates that only 79% of teachers felt that they "had the   opportunities to work productively with teachers from other schools on professional development."     100% of our Pre Transition and Transition members who were surveyed in June 2017 stated that inter-  visitations and site visits would help them improve their pedagogy and knowledge of transition planning.     According to the most recent 2014 – 2015 Quality Review, “The work of team teachers has resulted in   improved pedagogy and student progress on assessments (4.2). However, it states, “Although some teachers  use a variety of classroom strategies that support differences in students’ learning styles, interests and  abilities, other teachers still demonstrate teacher-directed lesson planning not allowing students frequent  opportunities to cement their teaching through a peer exchange of ideas and assessments.”(4.1). This quality  indicator “area of focus” which received a "proficient" rating, reinforces the need for improvement in  pedagogy through targeted inter-visitations, including the expansion of visits to other cohorts, grade levels,  subjects and schools                  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          23     Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers.

In the most current 2014-15 Quality Review, the school's area of focus was to "develop teacher pedagogy from a  coherent set of beliefs about how students learn best." Over the past three years, 373K has succeeded in creating a  safe and inclusive environment that supports progress towards professional collaboration and capacity building. (QR  3.4)      According to the final 2017-2018 PPO report conducted by Superintendent Louissaint, it states, “As a Principal, you  collaborate with your entire school community to ensure that the Theory of Action for the school’s continuous  improvement is known and shared. You involve and communicate your plans with all stakeholders, Your school is  recognized as a Teacher Powered School. Teachers are granted autonomy and are trusted to make decisions that will  foster school success.”       In the 2017-18 School Quality Guide, under the category “Effective School Leadership”, 95% of teachers agreed that  the principal at the school communicates a clear vision for their school and 99% say the principal sets high standards  for student learning. However, only 80% of teachers agreed that the principal participates in instructional planning  with teams of teachers. Based on this data, a need exists to increase the principal-teacher collaboration process.  Through initial conferences, observations, and participation in PLC meetings, the principal will work together with  staff on instructional planning and target individualized professional development plans to achieve these goals . The  overall rating in Instructional Leadership was 92%.      In addition to teacher professional development, the Para Advisory Committee (PAC), presently in its second year of  inception, serves to include paraprofessionals in decision making policies. The principal meets with them monthly.  This year, with 21 new para hires, a buddy program between more experienced paraprofessionals and new staff was  established. Targeted professional development to meet their specific needs will be an additional component in this  coming school year.   It is our goal to maintain and build upon our already established and successful culture for learning and to provide  structured opportunities to design and implement innovate approaches to improving learning, work and practice.             2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          28     Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership.

In an effort to improve understanding  and planning for students' futures, we have adopted a home outreach program.     Our most recent 2014-15 Quality Review report for indicator 3.4, Communicating High Expectations, states   that “the school provides a multitude of avenues for families to understand their children’s strengths and  areas in need of improvement.”     High School teaching staff send home a weekly progress report, aligned to the report card rubric, which is   reviewed and returned with a parent signature.     Parents complete Vocational Level One Interest Inventories to support their students instruction, and to   provide direction for pedagogical staff about desired adult outcomes when students leave our program at 21.     Transition teachers are in constant contact with parents as they complete person centered plans and make   agency connections that will support our students as they age-out of the program.     We have a 3.43 rating in the 2017 - 2018 NYC School Quality Guide in "Strong Family-Community Ties" which      is .37 below the city wide average.  In the 2017-2018 school year 49 families in our Structured TEACCHing cohort participated in home visits, as a  part of the Parent Teacher Home Visit Program (PTHV).. The home visits produced valuable information about  our students and their families. Additionally, the Home Visit Program highlighted the need for additional  families to become involved.     The school conducts many events throughout the school year where parents are encouraged to participate in,   including Meet the Faculty day, Parent/teacher conferences, Saturday workshops for families on various  topics (Guardianship, SSI, OPWDD, Transition, Medicaid Services, Adult Services), Planting day, Bike day, etc.     Only approximately 2% of parents attended special school events in the past year.    PA meetings were conducted throughout the year.    During the parent workshops and meetings, we provide translation for the ELL's families.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42     State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43           Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS 373, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      PS 373 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the ESSA;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

Students are served in classrooms  with ratios of: 12:1:1, 8:1:1, and 6:1:1. All classrooms are equipped to ensure that the optimal  learning environment is created for all students. Our classrooms contain updated technology,  appropriate spatial settings, and trained and certified staff to accommodate all needs of our  students. At the Brooklyn Transition Center, our goal is for each student to become as  independent as possible upon graduation from our school. We offer five different programs to  our students and provide appropriate placement based on individual needs. The programs are:  structured teaching, service learning, pre-transition, inclusion, and transition. In addition to these  transitional programs, our students are also provided with opportunities to participate in work  related activities throughout the school.  Our students participate in the annual New York State Alternate Assessment (NYSAA) to  measure student progress in core content areas. English Language Learners participate in the  annual New York State English as a Second Language Achievement Test (NYSESLAT) which  is a  standardized assessment to measure progress in areas of English Language Acquisition.  Based on the results of the Spring 2018 NYSESLAT and Student Annual Needs Determination  Inventory (SANDI) Assessment our school staff can conclude that our ELL students need more  support in developing skills in all tested areas including listening, speaking, reading, and writing.  Therefore, a supplemental program that promotes the growth of all four of the aforementioned  skills would be most appropriate.  The "373K Transition Kitchen" is the Title III direct instruction supplemental program that was  introduced  to our students for the 2017-2018 school year. Because of its previous success, this  program will continue during the 2018-2019 school year and will serve a different group of ELL  students . The Title III program will occur from November  2018 to May 2019 on Tuesdays for a  duration of two and a half hours 2:35pm-5:05pm for a total of twenty weeks (on Tuesdays, our  school day ends at 2:30 p.m.). The program will serve 12 ELL students in grades 10, 11, and 12.  The population of students to be served will be derived from classes containing  12:1:1 ratios.  There will be one certified teacher (ENL/Special Education teacher) present along with the  support of two certified  paraprofessionals totaling three staff members for the duration of the  program.  One paraprofessional will serve as an alternate placement paraprofessional to support  the language needs of students in the program while the other serves as health/crisis support for  students with services listed on their Individualized Education Plan. The program will be  supervised by the Assistant Principal who will receive compensation beginning at 4:05 as their  day ends at 4pm.  Instruction will be delivered in the English language by the ENL/ Special  Education teacher.  Our ELLs will benefit from the explicit instruction that will be provided throughout this  program.  According to research, the routines and consistent language used in explicit teaching   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   provide ELLs clear, specific, and easy-to-follow procedures as they learn not only a new skill or  strategy but also the language associated with it (Calderon, Hertz-Lazarowitz, & Slavin,  2005; Edelsky et al., 2007; Hernandez, 2012; Muniz-Swicegood, 2012; Saunders et al.,  2015).  The "373K Transition Kitchen" will provide an opportunity for our students to increase  listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills while incorporating cultural awareness into  instruction.  Every week students will research, choose ingredients, and create culturally diverse  dishes as a group while having ENL  methodologies incorporated into their lessons. Students will  increase their listening and speaking skills while participating in group discussions about  culturally specific meals and healthy foods.  Students will have the opportunity to increase  reading skills when being exposed to recipes, shopping lists, ingredients, and etc. Writing skills  will be practiced by writing informal reviews of dishes, taking customer's orders, creating a  cookbook and etc.  Specific goals that will address the above mentioned targeted skills during this Title III program  include but are not limited to:  Increasing focusing and listening skills  Sequencing and summarizing literature/recipes  Increasing math skills/measuring,telling time, etc.  Reading a text for information  Increasing communication skills by engaging participating in group discussions  Increasing Vocabulary  Enhancing organization and English language use when writing  Growing English communication and comprehension skills  Improving English and home language expressive and receptive language skills    While all skills above are being addressed during instruction, ENL methodologies such as Total  Physical Response (TPR), repetition, modeling, and etc. will be incorporated into instruction in  order to ensure that our ELLs are increasing their English language skills. According to Tim  Bowen, "TPR activities used judiciously and integrated with other activities can be highly  motivating and linguistically purposeful." (Bowen, 2013).  The Transition Kitchen program will  also increase the vocabulary of our ELLs, improve their English Basic Interpersonal  Communicative Skills (BICS) and Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency (CALP)  communication abilities, and increase their Activities of Daily Living (ADL).  The ENL  teacher will ensure that all instruction is appropriately differentiated and modified to meet  student's needs.  Using Title III funds, the Transition Kitchen will need to purchase ingredients on a weekly basis  to create healthy meals and promote healthy eating habits. We will also purchase the  Santillana curriculum to support our Spanish speaking English language learners.

Professional development will occur on a monthly basis for  seven  Thursdays  for a duration of one hour beginning in November 2018 and ending in April of  2019. Because regular working hours are from 8:00am until 2:30pm, our professional  development meetings will begin at 2:35pm and end at 3:35pm starting in November 2018 and  occurring throughout the duration of the program. During seven sessions, Certified ENL teacher,  Arileyda Duran (seven sessions), three of the school's special education teachers,  two  paraprofessionals, and a supervisor (supervisor will not be compensated by Title III funds as PDs  will occur during regular administrative work hours) will work collaboratively to create  professional development sessions that will be delivered to other teachers and paraprofessionals  within the school community.  The special education teachers (M. Barbiera,  F. Valentin, and Q.  Zannoni) are teachers whose class rosters are composed of fifty percent or more of ELLs. They  understand the various needs that teachers in our school community must possess in order to  support  and provide instruction to the ELL students in their classrooms. Using valuable  information and research from the ELL Policy and Reference Guide, NYSESLAT Handbook,  researched ELL methodologies and best practices, and our school's "Healthy New You"  curriculum which includes healthy meal options and dietary practices, the  ENL teacher and  special education teachers will collaboratively create and present PDs on topics such as  ELL  Identification Process, Enhancing Language Skills through Culinary Arts, ENL Instructional  Methodologies, Providing Instruction to ELLs in Special Education, Understanding SIFE,  Modifying Lesson Plans and Curriculum for ELL students, and Understanding the NYSESLAT.  These professional development sessions are necessary as they will enhance the understanding,  knowledge, and skills to appropriately deliver instruction and English language support to  ELLs.  The remaining four professional development sessions will involve research and reviews  related to the importance of food and culinary arts globally as well as the impact of culinary art  practices on ELLs and students with disabilities before and during transition. A certified ENL  teacher, Arileyda Duran, will deliver ELL workshops based on ENL/Special Education  philosophies and instructional methodologies including the Introduction and Expectations of the  2018-2019 Title III program, Kitchen and Food Prep Safety, Enhancing/Differentiating the hands  on participation activities of ELLS, and Planning Culminating Activities.          Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact  higher achievement for ELLs.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?       Here at P373K, the entire student population is comprised of alternate assessment students.  Modified assessments must be  used to determine our students' level of literacy functioning. These  assessments include and are not limited to the following:  teacher-created assessments, SANDI, FAST, NYSAA, NYSESLAT (standardized) NYSITELL, and LAB R (standardized).  Teacher created assessments include differentiated tasks that appeal to various learning styles to determine levels and  appropriateness of student communication, comprehension, ability to summarize, and many other literacy skills. SANDI  (Student Annual Needs Determination Survey) is a District 75 wide, school wide assessment that is used to identify the  academic, social-emotional, and communication strengths and weaknesses of all of our students. Scrantron is another  assessment used for our students, but it differs as it students is used for students that demonstrate very little weaknesses on   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      the SANDi assessment and show a need for challenging tasks. Teacher made materials and SANDI  assessments all consists  of  a group of differentiated activities that determine student strengths in the areas of reading and writing  Like the SANDI, Scantron assesses the academic strengths and weaknesses; however, it focus is primarily academic.  The SANDI  and Scantron Assessments are administered throughout the school year to determine student progress throughout the school  year.   .     Based on the data from the results of all aforementioned  assessments, we are able to conclude that our ELLs  have significant  cognitive delays in addition to limited English language skills and are in need of  a modified grade level curriculum. We also  conclude that our students should remain in a structured environment receiving differentiated instruction with linguistic  objectives in order to support their English Language needs.  The data from these assessments identifies literacy weaknesses  that we can label as target areas and begin to formulate a plan of action to address these areas during our Professional  Learning Community meetings. Also, this assessment data allows us to review the ELLs' individual progress during common  planning periods and appropriate intervention strategies can be created and implemented.         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   We currently have three TESOL certified teachers that work very closely with classroom teachers and administration to ensure  that our the instructional planning for our English language learners is appropriate and effective. During cohort, classroom,  and IEP meetings, our teachers discuss student strengths and weaknesses before creating action plans to assist them in  reaching their goals. TESOL teachers also plan lessons with classroom teachers ensuring that linguistic goals are embedded in  every lesson. All lessons are created based on the  IEP goals that are developed based on the results of the above referenced  assessments. Instruction is modified to include strategies that appeal to ELLs with disabilities including by not limited to visual  aides, graphic organizers, repetition, and etc. ELL staff have also created and utilize ELL rubrics based on the target focus areas  and domains of the NYSESLAT assessment.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  NYSAA (New York State Alternate Assessment) is a state measure of assessment that consists of modified tasks in different  subject areas used  to assess our students' levels of literacy functioning. NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, and LAB R are all state mandated  standardized assessments meant to assess literacy skills of  English language learners.  However, these assessments are  standardized assessments, and because of our students academic and cognitive delays; these assessments are inappropriate  literacy assessment tools.  P 373K evaluates the needs of our ELLs by analyzing student data folios, progress reports, and scores from the NYSAA and  NYSESLAT (New York State English as a Second Language Achievement Test).     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Student data folios reveal the progress made by students and their progress is measured based on the achievement of annual  goals of the students placed on the IEPs. Progress reports also display the student’s potential to meet their IEP goals. Scores  from the NYSAA reveal the students performance levels on content subject areas. The NYSESLAT reveals student progress in  language acquisition. NYSESLAT is not an appropriate assessment tool for students that are alternately assessed.  Teacher feedback, Inquiry Team feedback, and Professional Learning Community feedback are other means that our school  uses to review the current programs and determines what necessary changes need to be made in order to improve the school  wide ELL programs.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   P373K is a high school for students with disabilities servicing students from grades 9-12, and  RTI frameworks are not utilized  as we modify curriculum and use ENL methodologies to guide instruction for our English language learners.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         P373K uses data from the annual NYSESLAT assessments to determine where the weaknesses of our English language learners  exist within the four domains of the assessment: speaking, listening, reading, and writing.  Because the NYSESLAT is a  standardized assessment, we do not exclusively rely on the data derived from it. Outcome data from SANDI is also used to  determine what the academic needs for our English language learners are.  Newcomers take the NYSITELL examination (depending on LPT team decision) and the Spanish Lab if their home language is  Spanish. We use data from the NYSITELL to determine ELL status and to locate an appropriate ELL program and classroom  placement for the student with parent consideration.  We also consider data from informal assessments including but not  limited to the home language identification survey, class data binders, and ELL progress reports.  Once we understand the  needs of our students, we are then able to create appropriate programs depending on teacher availability and budget  allowances.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Weekly professional learning community meetings are held to discuss new findings based on student data. These findings give  us insight that assist us in determining the  placement of ELL students within our school community,  potential for expanding  our school ELL programs, and etc. We also consistently share information via email, inter- visitation, and teacher collaboration  meetings.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Our three TESOL teachers  provide standalone and integrated ENL to all English language learners. Students are  usually grouped based on their placement, IEP mandated ratios,  and goals. These groups are usually heterogeneous  and differentiation is incorporated throughout instruction. When providing standalone instruction, groups are  comprised of students with homogeneous goals in an attempt to improve targeted skills using peer collaboration.  With both heterogeneous and homogeneous groups, Students receive instruction that are aligned to the common  core standards, Essential Elements and Linkage Levels in the DLM, and based on their cognition levels.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Due to unavailability of dual certified teachers(special education and bilingual) , our Spanish bilingual program was  closed during the 2016-2017 school year. However, we are in the process of searching for appropriately certified  personnel to work in a bilingual program.    c.  DL program.  If applicable.      As of September 2017, P373K has opened a Spanish/English dual language program.  ELL students in this class receive  both HLA ( from certified Bilingual Spanish Special Education teacher) and ENL (from a certified ENL Special Education  teacher).       2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Because the majority of our English language learners have severe cognitive delays, they score at an entering level on the  NYSESLAT and are entitled to the maximum amount of mandated minutes, 540.  Here at P373K, we have three TESOL certified  teachers providing services throughout eight  sites and ensure that the ELL students receive the maximum of instructional  minutes possible.  We make an effort to maximize services for all of our ELL students. This is monitored by compliance   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61      documents that are submitted to our district office four times a year. It is also monitored by school administration and ENL  teachers on a bi-weekly basis in our cohort meetings.   At our dual language site, we have a special education/ bilingual Spanish certified teacher with a 12:1:1 class composed of half  English monolingual and half Spanish monolingual. We rotate HLA and ENL instruction on a daily bi-daily basis.  One ENL  teacher goes to the site two times a week and delivers ENL services.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Teachers of our ELL programs use the P373K curriculum and follow the connected pacing calendar as well. The curriculum that  is created at P373K is aligned to Common Core state standards and  CDOS standards, and is created to include meeting the  individual goals and needs of our students. To ensure that content delivery is consistent with student needs and abilities,  teachers utilize principles such as backwards design, UDL, and  student prior knowledge. We are reminded of student goals  daily as most of the student goals in our school community are posted throughout student classrooms.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   The state does  not offer alternate assessments in languages other than English to ELL students with disabilities other than the  Spanish Lab.  This assessment is only administered to students that have a home language other than English and are  newcomers or readmits to the Department of Education. It does not offer any annual or continual progress monitoring for our  ELLs. We offer translation and interpretation for for every bilingual mandated students in order to informally assess our ELL  students using appropriate questioning and discussion techniques in their native languages.   We also provide the  Santillana curriculum for our students that provides instruction and assessment in Spanish.        5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    ENL and Content Area Instruction is differentiated according to the specific needs of ELLs from different subgroups:   a.   Students with Inconsistent Formal Education receive daily ENL classes with additional support from Expanding and  Commanding students, tutoring from content specialty teachers, and home language resources.  b. Newcomers (0-3 years of service) are supported through a variety of differentiated activities in all areas of participation  throughout our school. They visual extra native language support as they are placed in classes with alternate placement  paraprofessionals even if they are not entitled to bilingual instruction. We ensure that we create a strong relationship with  parents and families by offering English language support and home language resources to them as well.   c. Developing English language learners receive more challenging activities than SIFE and Newcomer ELLs. They are expected  to complete activities that can display their developing skills in the four domains of the NYSESLAT speaking, reading, writing,  and listening. They receive ENL services in addition to AIS services, mandated management needs being met during  instruction, TItle III participation, and peer activities to enhance English language skills.   d. Long term ELLs are supported through AIS, Instructional Technology, peer tutoring, Title III program, visual arts enrichment.  e. Because our students are cognitively delayed, we have only had a hand full of students that have scored Commanding on  the NYSESLAT assessment . These students are placed in vocational settings once they become former ELLs and still receive  their mandated ENL minutes.        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Because our population is composed of students with a variety of different disabilities and management needs, we have to  create and locate many different age and level appropriate resources to meet their needs. English language development is   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62      heavily embedded into our ELA core instruction. Resources that support our ELA academic content are System 44, Read 180,  Attainment, and Unique. All of these resources address literacy and English language development. We also use the  Santillana program for our ELLs . This program provides home language and English language support.      Strategies incorporated into our instructional planning and delivery include but are not limited to TPR (total physical response),  scaffolding, constant visual aides, repetition, daily reviews, and activation of prior/relevant knowledge.  In conjunction with the  aforementioned strategies, we also offer discrete trials and TEACCH methodologies during instruction to our ELLs with 6:1:1  ratio mandates. Technology is also incorporated into our instruction to support our ELLs.  English language learners are given  the opportunity to work with the support of smart boards, IPADS, communication boards, and other means of technology that  provide research opportunities, visuals, and practice of technological skills.    EVery year, our instructional staff  creates grade level curriculum that is modified to meet the specific academic needs of our  students. We use IEP goals, CCLS, and management needs to construct this curriculum.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?   P373K is a high school for alternate assessment students with disabilities. All students participate in the NYSAA and are placed  according to their IEP mandates. Scheduling flexibility is applied within our school to grant our students the opportunity to  receive exposure to our diverse programs and student populations. For example, when ENL services are provided to our  students using the Standalone model, students are grouped with peers with identical mandated ratios; however, groups also  consist of students from different classes. Integrated models are utilized with many and various classroom teachers to ensure  scheduling flexibility and a co-teaching learning experience for our students. Changes are also made to schedules as mandates  and services are changed and/or revised on an IEP. Instructional flexibility is seen in a variety of strategies and supports for our  students. These supports and strategies include but are not limited to differentiation, flexible teacher created curriculum,  various academic resources,  individualized learning experiences (questioning, work products, and etc), teaching assistants,  and related services. The needs of all of our ELLs are taken into consideration when curriculum and school organization is  developed annually. Also, all teachers meet on a weekly basis to collaborate and create appropriate instruction and support  tools for ELLs with disabilities.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.   Intervention programs are offered at P373K for ELLs in all subgroups in the Freestanding ENL model and in the Dual Language  (Spanish/English) model in ELA and Social Studies are Fundations, Teacher's College Reading and Writing Continum, Wilson  Foundations,  SMILE, Unique, WIN, WAVE, Attainment, Ablenet, and JARS.  Interventions used in Math are Attainment, Unique,  WAVE, and the Eden Curriculum. Interventions used in Science are Ablenet Focus on Science and HAP (Health Advocacy  Program). These interventions are offered in English with the assistance of the ENL teachers, Spanish bilingual teacher, and the  Alternate Placement Paraprofessional when necessary and are all aligned to the CCLS.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Based on data, we see that we are in desperate need of a Spanish bilingual program. We are currently seeking a dual certified  special education/ Spanish bilingual certified teacher to teach a self contained Spanish bilingual class. We will also be  expanind our dual language program to accommodate more students. Parent, student, and staff surveys have shown that  ELLs are not participating in our school's vocational programs. Therefore, we have created a school based work site in the form  of a school store/kiosk that will be run by or English language learners.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   There was a Spanish bilingual program here at P373K. Unfortunately, it was initially closed due to low enrollment. However,  when we were ready to reopen the class, we found that we could not locate a teacher with the necessary credentials to have  the self contained class. We are continuing to search for a teacher with the certification requirements.      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63      ELLs are afforded the same access and opportunities as the rest of our student population.   In addition to our regular  school  programming, we offer after school programs such as Middle School After School, CHAMPS, AHRC, and Title III. ELLs are invited  to and always participate in these programs.   We have a variety of school programs that ELLs are entitled to being apart of.  Such programs include but are not limited to  student government,  buddy programs, empowerment groups, debate teams, and more.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Core content is delivered by the ENL Teacher through collaboration with each student's classroom teacher through the use of  research-based ELL Teaching techniques. These techniques foster language development and meet the demands of the  Common Core Language Standards.To support ELLs, our school uses a variety of instructional materials, including technology.  Every classroom has a Smart Board, some ELLs uses AACs (Augmentative Communication Devices) as per their IEP, all ELL  students have access to MAC laptops and MAC's with Touch Screens. Teachers of ELLs with autism use the boardmaker  computer program to create Mayer-Johnson picture cues/communication symbols, color printers and laminators to effectively  communicate with their ELL students.  Instructionally, we use Wilson Fundantions, ABLLS-R, Attainment, NYSAA Pacing  calendar, teacher made materials, i-pads (specific language programs), collaborative materials made with the classroom  teacher, and any specific manipulatives used by our support staff such as Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, and Speech  and Language Therapy. In addition, depending on the age/grade of the ELL students and his/her IEP the following instructional  materials (in alignment to the CCLS) may be used:  Wilson Fundations/Foundations, Words your Way, Reading Street, SMILE,  Headsprout, Ablenet, JARS,  McGraw Hill Literacy Program, Unique, D75 Curriculum, News2You, WIN and WAVE.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Currently, our school offers only an ENL program, but is looking forward to opening a dual language program in September of  2017.  Home language support is provided to English learners in our ENL program. Initially, HLIS surveys are assessed, and we  determine the native language abilities of our students. Native Spanish speaking students are also given the  NYSITELL examination upon entry into the DOE. This assessment assists us in determining the level of native Spanish language  and English language needs that our students have.  Instruction is then created using scaffolding with communication in native  language and/or other needs of the activation of prior knowledge. In turn , cross language transfer process is initiated, and our  students are more likely to process academic content.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    At 373K, we ensure that services and supports are grade appropriate for our students by checking to make sure that materials  are aligned with the grade appropriate Common Core Learning Standards.  Staff also makes sure that content is age  appropriate by reviewing content and visual supplements prior to distributing contents to students. Staff also ensures that  resources are modified to incorporate appropriate visuals and appropriate vocabulary in student assessments.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Currently, our school is not co-located with any other schools. Our building is used exclusively for P373K.      16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Prior to the start of every school year, newly enrolled ELL students and their parents are invited to come to our school for an  orientation meeting. During this orientation meeting, our ELL programs are displayed and described for our parents in an  attempt to provide a deeper understanding of our ELL programs. Title III information is also shared with parents at this time.  When families come in to complete the intake process, we also display the DOE ELL parent choice video to the families. When  completing the home language identification survey, parents are also questioned about their language preferences for  communication from our school.    Throughout the school year ELLs and their parents are invited to all PA meetings, workshops organized by the parent  coordinator, parent/teacher Conferences, and IEP meetings. The parents receive letters in their native language and  translators are provided when needed.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64         17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    At this time, we do not offer language electives to our English language learners as it is not a requirement in D75.        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   P373K currently offers an English/Spanish dual language program at one of its work site, Buena Vida  Nursing Home. It is a self contained work site which uses the 50/50 model. Core Content is taught in both  the English and Spanish languages. the ENL teacher is responsible for English language instruction, and  the Spanish bilingual teacher is responsible for instruction in Spanish. Resources and activities are color  coded to differentiate between languages. Locations are also changed to ensure instructional language  separation. For students with bilingual mandates, foundational literacy skills in the students' home  languages are established first to promote emergent literacy in the English language.         Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?   All ELL personnel at our school attend professional development four to five times during the school year.  These personnel  include: Assistant Principals, Bilingual/ENL Coordinators, Paraprofessionals, Classroom Teachers, ENL Teachers, Guidance  Counselors, Speech Therapists, Occupational Therapists, Physical Therapists, and the Parent Coordinator.  These workshops  are offered through District 75 and at the school level. They cover NYSESLAT testing, NYSITELL testing, ENL methodologies, and  compliance information.   On the school level, all staff members attend three workshops per school year on the Common Core  Learning Standards, balanced literacy, content area instruction, and formative and summative assessments) that incorporate  using ELL methodologies. Many of our teachers require the mandate of 10 hours of Jose P. training.  Certificates are kept on  file at the main site.     To support ELLs as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards, the District offers several ENL and Bilingual teacher  Professional Development sessions. Professional development will focus on working with the varied learning styles of ELL  students with disabilities, celebrating multiple intelligences and maximizing students' performance through the use of their  varied learning styles in conjunction with quality IEP that is aligned to CCLS and addresses language and culture issues via ENL  methodologies, enhancement of the native language, and assessment in both native and target languages.  Additionally, all  Domains from the Danielson FfT are addressed.Teachers at 373K are encouraged to participate in the District 75 ELL office  professional development series which include but are not limited to, Collaborative Team Teaching for ENL Teachers, Providing  Instruction for ELLs on the Autism Spectrum, and Compliance Institutes.             2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65         Throughout the school year, our  three ENL teachers will provide the mandated 15% of total hours for all non ELL classroom  teachers and administrators. These teachers will provide professional development that specifically addresses the needs of  ELLs including language acquisition, best practices for co-teaching strategies, and integrating language and content instruction.  These sessions are usually conducted during our extended day sessions and Professional Development Calendar school days.  Our  ENL teachers will receive the required minimum of 50% at workshops provided by the District 75 Office of English  Language Learners, and the Department of English Language Learners and Student Support that are dedicated to language  acquisition in alignment with core content instruction, best practices for co-teaching strategies, and integrating language and  content instruction for ELLs.  Administrators and school secretaries keep records of all professional development activities  through the use of attendance sheets, workshop agendas,certificates of completion, and presenter evaluation forms.        Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Our school provides many opportunities throughout the school year for the parents of our ELLs to come into our school and  learn about the program that is offered here. English language development skills, NYSESLAT assessment results, student  strengths and weaknesses are discussed in detail with parents during parent teacher conferences as well as  IEP meetings.  In  accordance with the revised  CR Part 154, we also provide opportunities for parents of our ELL students  to  conference with our ELL teachers to explore the levels of progression and/or regression of of ELL students. Our school also  obtains an open door policy. Parents are able to come in to discuss any issues or concerns that they may have with our ELL  programs. Teachers and parents also maintain open dialogue through means of email, telephone conversations,  student communication notebooks and logs, and etc. if ever necessary, a school based pedagogue is used to interpret  conversations and  translate documentation. In addition to the above listed parent meetings, our ELL teachers also individually  meet with the parents and guardians of our ELLs at least once a year. During these meetings, we discuss program goals,  student progress, assessment results, and language needs in content areas.       2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Parents of our ELLs play a very pivotal role in the ELL programs here at P373K. Parent choice once a HLIS has been completed  is the driving force behind our ELL programs. Their choices dictate the need for both ELL programs in our school (ENL and DL).  Parents also provide relevant information about our ELLs including their communication preferences outside of school,  language history, and language goals. Our school offers many workshops throughout the school year such as Front Door  information sessions, legal guardianship, and IEP Processes. For every workshop, there are interpreters on hand to meet the  needs of our ELL parents. These interpreters, comprised of bilingual staff, are also available during conferences and other non- ELL related workshops.  Our non-ELL related workshops are offered to all parents and guardians. They usually pertain to  children with disabilities or standard based instruction. We also host Title III meetings throughout the school  year specifically for our ELL parents.            Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Regina Tottenham, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   The Brooklyn Transition Center                                                                              School DBN: 75K373  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Language   In order to discover the language needs of parents, our school utilizes data obtained from the Home Language  Survey as well as the Home Language data reports retrieved from the Department of Education ATS system. In  addition, our teachers conduct Level One Vocational Parent Interviews with parents at the beginning of the school  year and parents are asked to reveal their preferred language needs. Also, parents are asked to complete  emergency cards at initial registration which request that parents list the languages spoken in their homes. Based  on these interviews, surveys, and data reports; our staff is able to conclude what the language needs of our  parents and families are. Our staff ensures that all written notifications are translated into the preferred  languages of parents before they are distributed. We also enlist staff members that speak the preferred languages  of the parents to provide oral translation and interpretation to our families. If there are no available staff to speak  the required language, we contact the Department of Education Translation Unit prior to the arrival of our  parents in order to ensure that we have someone to translate and/or interpret the language for the parent.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70         2.
