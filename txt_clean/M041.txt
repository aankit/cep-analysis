This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          6     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      PS 41 is a collaborative community dedicated to the mission of providing the highest quality education to each of our  students. Central to our mission is a shared belief that each child brings to our school a unique set of abilities and  talents. Our highly dedicated faculty work closely together in an enriching environment for all of our students. Equally  central to our mission is the teaching of important community values. Thus, we encourage children to celebrate  diversity, to respect each other, and to work together with shared goals. We recognize a supportive environment as   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8      one that also includes clear expectations and academic rigor.

Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   Located in the heart of historic Greenwich Village, PS41 both reflects the rich cultural diversity of our neighborhood,  and dynamically incorporates the resources of our neighborhood into our studies. The arts are integrated into all  curriculum areas. Our building is a vibrant testimony to the creative pulse of our community.    Our Green roof Environmental Literacy Laboratory (GELL), which opened in September 2012, has become an  important new outdoor classroom and community space for our school. The green roof gives teachers and students  the opportunity to observe and conduct hands-on experiments outside of the classroom in a natural setting. The  green roof has also supported us in building community with numerous learning events to support staff, families,  and our local community (city-wide events like Open House NY, teacher training, hosting other schools for tours,  and events with partners such as National Wildlife Federation). PS41 is partnering with MS 442 and The Bronx  Design & Construction Academy High School to develop and publish a first-of-its-kind K-12 green roof curriculum  guide.   We provide a variety of enrichment opportunities to support students’ interests, passions and academic learning.  We believe that students’ exposure to various arts and academic enrichment clubs assists them with engaging in  critical conversations, and reinforces and enhances the learning that takes place in classrooms.   - Book clubs   -Math Olympiads  -Extended Day clubs (specialty and classroom teachers) during non-academic Extended Day, so that all students  have the opportunity to participate   - STEM science club   - Technology club   - Track   - Art club   - Poetry club   - National Dance Institute   - Chorus   - Band (Rhythm-cats)   -Chess   -PAF intervention group  -Social Skills group  -Reading Recovery  -Whitney Partnership   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      -High Line Partnership      Family-School Partnership   Our family-school partnership is integral to everything we set out to accomplish at PS41. A meaningful and engaged  connection to one’s community and school has a significant and symbiotic impact upon academic progress. To that  end, we have devoted considerable time, effort and resources to providing multiple and varied opportunities for  every one of our 745 families to participate and be productive in our community.   Examples of our strong commitment to the family-school partnership:    Strong, respectful and dynamic partnership between the Parent Coordinator, parents, teachers and staff and  administration. Parents have an accessible and proactive liaison who works closely and positively with all school  staff. In addition, the Parent Coordinator has connected every family to differentiated e-mail lists and draws on  professional writing skills to communicate in a highly effective and valuable manner.     The School Leadership Team , in addition to working on the CEP, will continue to collect feedback from families that  provide constructive, productive information for the administration.   Examples of fostering home and school connections are:  -Family mornings-monthly gatherings of families with their children's class where lessons, curriculum and  celebratory events are conducted  -Class Potlucks-an annual tradition at the beginning of the year helps build community among families in the class  and create an adult connection to the teacher  -Back to School Night- program has been designed to provide both an overview of the curriculum and an  opportunity for parents to socialize and engage with one another in the building  -green Market- reinforce the work done via WITS to teach about health and nutrition; set up and pricing provides  real world way to engage math and communication skills  After school Fair- community access to the diversity of programs available to families to provide care and  enrichment opportunities after school,and before and on school holidays  -Kindergarten family picnic and middle school search meetings--support for incoming and outgoing students  -Workshops for families on subjects that include helping your children with transitions, safe technology, grief  counseling, math and literacy curriculum  Supportive Environment--Through our school-wide reflection process, our teachers noticed a need to support  colleagues in developing specific tools and strategies to help struggling learners be more successful.  This is how the Student Intervention Team (SIT) was formed. As a way to help build student independence,  accountability and transference in our instruction, classroom teachers from multiple grades decided to  collaboratively build a team to study how we could support students by helping teachers embed modifications in  all aspects of their instruction.   The team is composed of special education teachers in the lower grades (PreK-2) a special education teacher and  general education teacher in the upper grades (3-5), and 2 service providers. We have built in time for the team to  meet weekly, either before or after school; and time for classroom teachers to present, inquire, and plan with the  team.     The SIT will help and guide classroom teachers to provide interventions, accommodations and modifications for  students who are having academic and/or behavioral challenges. The SIT will tailor its support to individual  classroom and/or grade level needs. SIT members will help provide and implement specific tools and strategies for  teachers to help students (e.g., differentiation, adaptive materials, classroom management, engagement, behavior  plans). These interventions are to be implemented before students are referred to PPT. The interventions will be  hands on, practical and specific.   In reviewing our SLT survey, and feedback from our community (students, families, teachers), we found that  although we had workshops to address many topics we believed we should cover as a school (forming positive  friendships, establishing routines), community members felt that a better way to approach the engagement of  students, self-awareness and the building of healthy relationships would be to have a school-wide character  education program that addressed these topics across grades and departments.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Since healthy peer relationships predict students’ grades both concurrently and over time, PS41 developed a  Character Education Program, launched in September 2013. A committee of teachers and administrators  researched and analyzed various character programs, with the goal of selecting one to implement school wide. It  was concluded that the ideal program would be one created by our own community, bringing together the best of  many programs, as well as resources developed by the 41 faculty. One character trait is highlighted every month  (e.g., respect, empathy, resilience). Developmental lesson plans are created by our Community Building  Committee, which consists of many faculty members across grades and content areas . We continue to refine this  program based on feedback from students, families and teachers.     3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Students with ED classification-- need to provide more training to teachers in de-escalation strategies and find  community resources for families looking for mental health services.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   This past year the elements we made the most progress in are: Rigorous Instruction and Supportive Environment. Our  key areas of focus will be: to continue our work in providing all students with access to rigorous learning that will  increase cognitive engagement and to continue to provide a supportive environment where students and teachers  thrive.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 02M041   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   694   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     Over the last few years, we have continued to place an emphasis on having deep conversations and discussion.  Teachers and students have been considering the types of questions to ask that would elevate the level of dialogue in  classrooms. Structures and routines developed over the past few years have supported partner talk, small group and  whole group conversations. Teachers have been working towards having students lead whole group conversations,  posing their own questions and commenting on each others’ ideas. As a continuation of this work, we wanted to have  students take the lead with their own learning, including student self-reflection. After analyzing the results of our  State ELA exam scores we found in grades 3-5 that approximately 20% percent of our students on each of those  grades struggled with questions that centered on authors purpose and/or the central message of the text.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   All students will engage in conversations that cause them to think, reflect and deepen their understanding on their  continuum of learning. Students are expected to explain and justify their reasoning and conclusions based on  content-based evidence, and critique the reasoning of others     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and  strategies your school will implement to achieve the  identified goal for this Framework for Great Schools  element, including:   Target Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?     As we have realigned curriculum to meet CCLS, there have been greater demands requiring higher order thinking by  students. Teachers observed that when implementing rigorous lessons and tasks, there were groups of students that  were partially engaged. When looking at student data, teachers thought about how they were asking questions, what  tools they were using, and modifications being made to support the range of student needs.  The special education reform prompted us to think about how to support both special education and general  education teachers. For the past four years, our ICT teachers have been working closely with general education  teachers to provide access for students by sharing expertise.    .         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  By June 2017 all teachers will have training in tools/ strategies/techniques that provide all students access to  rigorous learning that will support students in staying cognitively engaged in lessons as measured by a student  growth on on demands assessments, mid unit benchmarks and end of unit assessments, as well as all teachers  scoring effective on at least two observations on their MOTP in 3C.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          16     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and  strategies your school will implement to achieve the  identified goal for this Framework for Great Schools  element, including:   Target Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

Teachers will work with our consultant from Kristen  Goldsmansor to study and create a toolbox of strategies to  support our students who struggle to articulate their thinking.  Our student intervention team will continue monthly  workshops for general education teachers. Ladder of scaffold  will be discussed and how those scaffolds are removed over  time to support student independence. Personalized charts  such as: word wall book mark, puffle step by step writing  support tips, math mini charts,what to do when stuck  cards,etc.. are given to students to use and  teachers/paraprofessionals teach into the use of these tools.  Table charts are available for content support as well as to  support organizational needs. During Curriculum night, family  morning each month and during teacher conferences,  families are provided with these tools so they can be utilized  at home to support ongoing earning across content areas.  These tool support strategies that focus on breaking down  information into smaller, manageable segments, acquiring  academic language, organizational skills and processing of  content information.

When the UFT contract was changed a few years back we worked with our teachers and instructional team to create a  vision for how we would structure our Monday afternoon professional development time. Each year we analyze the  work done, the impact on student achievement and teaching practices and make revisions to the plan to meet the  needs of our community. We have utilized various structures to support this ongoing work. Our teachers meet both  by grade level and cross grade level teams. We calendar our year long PD into 3 cycles. Utilizing Learning  Improvement Science has supported our need to want to understand problems more deeply. Is the problem we  identified a problem and if so, what evidence do we have to support that? The intention was to slow down jumping  into solutionitis. This is work we want to continue along with encourage our teachers to choose a topic/challenge they  feel passionate about studying in a more in depth way that will impact student a academic/social and emotional  growth.       Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.      Teachers will continue to refine and utilize cycles of learning to support student’s academic, social and emotional  growth. By June 2017 all teachers will have been involved in a minimum of three inquiry cycles and two topic based  inquiry cycles.   Last year several teams chose to look at the social/emotional development of children and factors that impact that  growth which then impact academic growth. Kindergarten looked at play and the impact on how children related to one  another through play to build social competence. Grade 5 studied the use of social media and the impact on peer  relationships and self esteem. Both teams took a different path in their cycle of learning and this work was shared with  all teams during our reflection sessions and resonates deeply with other teams. Cycles of learning provides the  structures to do this work and understand what challenges our students face, owe can best support them and improver  student growth. We will continue to employ teacher feedback on the effectiveness of how cycles are designed as well as  to share what protocols and structures worked best for deep collaborative team work to continue to thrive at our  school.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          19     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and  strategies your school will implement to achieve the  identified goal for this Framework for Great Schools  element, including:   Target Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   For the last two years our school has focused on how our mind set affects all aspects of our teaching practices as well  as interactions throughout the day. We hold the belief that a healthy community must talk openly about our  challenges as well as our successes. The admin team chose the book- growth Mindset by Carol Deck as our summer  reading last year. This year as we continue studying the topic of Growth Mindset we faced a new challenge around  how to offer support to our teachers who want to know how to best help children with trauma or escalating physical  and or emotional behaviors. We decided that along with the many trainings around de-escalation strategies and  workshops on students social and emotional (PBIS) well being we would take a step back to learn more about the  underlying factors that lead to these behaviors and how we can continue to build classroom communities where all  students value and feel safe taking risks, working through productive struggle and can relate positively to their peer  and teachers. This summer our faculty selected the book—Lost At School by Ross Greene as our summer reading. This  book came highly recommended by several teachers.       Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Column B   Verify with an (X)   Section Reference(s)   Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local                                                  1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S 41 The Greenwich VIllage School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of  Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent  involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the  families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision- making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School  Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of  the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   [PS 41] will support parents and families of Title I students by:         ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement  level, e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology;  ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning  and decision making in support of the education of their children;  ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support  and monitor their child’s progress;  ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;  ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format,  and in languages that parents can understand;  ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to  improve outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between  parents and other members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of  the school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School  Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their  members for additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the  school’s Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the  implementation of the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;  ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are  allocated directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting  skills;  ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and  strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team,  the Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes  providing technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership  skills;   ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and  families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the  assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school  environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of  events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.;  ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational  accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and  support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;   ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., NCLB/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report,  Quality Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;  ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise  parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their  right to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section  1118 and other applicable sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA).  ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the  morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of  the Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions;  ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;   ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations  and workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37         ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;  ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the  school year;  ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent- Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee;  ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;  ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;  ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;  ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of  their children’s progress;  ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed  about school activities and student progress;  ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a  format, and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  At PS 41 we use TCRWP as an assessment tool to assess the literacy skills of ELLs.  This assessment measures a variety of  literacy skills including: concepts about print, letter identification, high frequency word recognition, spelling skills, decoding  and comprehension skills.  We use these onoging running records, on demand assessments for pre and post unti work, mosl  asesments and conferencing to help support and plan for student needs and to design and modify lessons or grouping based  on needs presented. This also laoows us to plan appropriately for small group intervention work both as part of Tier 1 and Tier  2 Intervention.     We also regularly assess literacy in the ELL class.  Because our groups are small and divided by grade, we are able to strongly  support writing skills being taught by grade level.  We do a great deal of small group writing and editing, in addition to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      individualized pieces.  We use rubrics while writing and during the editing process, so students understand and internalize  what is expected of them.  Students in grades 2-5 keep dialogue journals with the ELL teacher, and are required to write and  turn in entries twice a week.  The ELL teacher keeps consistent records of oral language development,assessed through  individual conferences and classroom observations.  Noted are vocabulary, structure and general comprehension  development.     In accordance with the RTI Model for ELL's Academic Success, students we have who are below grade level in literacy and who  aren't showing enough improvement with Tier 1 support, get intensive, targeted intervention through extra reading/writing  support from a variety of sources.  Some of these sources are America Reads and student teachers, and AIS either in small  groups or through individual instruction.           2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?        3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We use a variety of methods to measure the success of our ELL program.  We analyze NYSESLAT data at the beginning of every  year to make sure that our ELLs are making consistent growth, but the ELL teacher also regularly monitors literacy  development through teacher-student conferences, portfolio assessment, and regularly kept dialogue journals (ELL  class).  Social English growth is monitored through individual student observation.  Aside from monitoring NYSESLAT results,  we also look at how our ELLs are faring in Science, Math and ultimately the ELA state tests.          4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?         5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   We collect a wide range of data to help us assess student needs. We use the data to drive our instruction, both in the regular  classroom, the ELL classroom, and when needed, with other Tier 2 or Tier 3 supports outside the classroom.        Our school places a strong emphasis on regular, personalized assessments, in addition to standardized tests, so we can analyze  students' needs and develop appropriate academic plans for them.  In the ELL classroom, we assess oral language  development through recorded observation of students interacting with peers during small group and paired work, and during  formal and informal (1:1 conferences) student-teacher interactions.  We use the data gathered to build oral language scaffolds  that focus on both social English and academic English.  We do word study lessons and use word thermometers that deal with  general conversation as well as conversation revolving around literature and specific content areas.       IWe will use RTI  as one way to support our ELLs through our Thursday meetings at 8:00am.  It is there that we will gather the  classroom teachers of all ELLs and provide support and training that they can use with their ELLs.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].    Our ELLs typically make great strides from year-to-year.  For example, almost all ELLs who began 2014-15 as "Entering," ended  the year as "Expanding." The only exceptions were two students who have learning disabilities. We attribute this to both the  immersive environment they are learning in and the coordination of all instructors working with the child to achieve grade  goals. With regard to grades, the younger the grade, the more improvement is seen. This is an expected outcome, given that  the Language Acquisition Device becomes less and less accessible the older the child becomes.  Since most of our ELLs are the  very young (K-2), we see much advancement from the NYSITELL to the NYSESLAT, due both to the nature of language  acquisition and the hard work of all instructors involved.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43         7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?            Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   This year, we have two Entering-level students.  One is a K, one is in 5        th       grade, so we are not able to instruct  them together. The rest are Emerging (1), Transitioning (1), and Expanding (10). Because we must support the lower  levels in a stand-alone model as well as an integrated one as per CR Part 154,  but because the very beginners are not  in the same grade band, Rebecca pulls these two children out for ENL instruction on a one-on-one basis.  Because it is  a one-on-one basis, individual needs can be met, and individual goals can be set and adjusted easily. So Rebecca  coordinates on a weekly basis with each classroom teacher, and learning goals are set.  Then in the next  correspondence, learning is assessed and new goals are set. As for the other ELL's, the administration has been able  to group them together to make Rebecca's time more effective.  For example, all the Expanding ELLs in 2         nd       grade are in the same class, and their teacher is ESL-Certified. In 1        st       grade, the two Expanding ELLs are  grouped in the same class, so that Rebecca can support two at the same time. In K, most of the ELLs are in one  classroom. One exception is the Transitioning student in 2        nd       grade, who is on the Special Education side of  the ICT class. Rebecca coordinates on a weekly basis with his classroom teachers and they decide the learning goals  for that week, before Rebecca pushes in to see him. Last is the Emerging Kindergartener, who is repeating  Kindergarten, has special circumstances (from a 3        rd      -world country, physical as well as learning disabilities)  and is seen by multiple service providers. Coordination with his ICT teaching team is also handled on a weekly basis.  So to summarize: individual goals are set weekly in coordination with the classroom teacher (via email or face-to-face  converstion).  Stand-alone or Integrated services are provided as per the new CR 154. Goals are assessed and  discussed weekly before moving on to new goals. We also email more frequently if a specific need arises, etc.     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Not applicable. We do not have the student population to require this program.     c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Not applicable. We do not have the student population to require this program.         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?                                 This year, we have two Entering-level students.  One is a K, one is in 5th grade, so we are not able to instruct  them together. The rest are Emerging (1), Transitioning (1), and Expanding (10). Because we must support the lower levels in a  stand-alone model as well as an integrated one as per the CR Part 154,  but because the very beginners are not in the same  grade band, Rebecca pulls these two children out for ENL instruction on a one-on-one basis.  Because it is a one-on-one basis,  individual needs can be met, and individual goals can be set. So Rebecca coordinates on a weekly basis with each classroom  teacher, and learning goals are set.  Then in the next correspondence, learning is assessed and new goals are set. As for the  other ELL's, the administration has been able to group them together to make Rebecca's time more effective.  For example, all  the Expanding ELLs in 2nd grade are in the same class, and their teacher is ESL-Certified. In 1st grade, the two Expanding ELLs  are grouped in the same class, so that I can support two at the same time. In K, most of the ELLs are in one classroom. One  exception is the Transitioning student in 2nd grade, who is on the Special Education side of the ICT class. Rebecca coordinates   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44      on a weekly basis with his classroom teachers and they decide the learning goals for that week, before Rebecca pushes in to  see him. Last is the Emerging Kindergartener, who is repeating Kindergarten, has special circumstances (from a 3rd-world  country, physical as well as learning disabilities) and is seen by multiple providers of services. Coordination with his ICT  teaching team is also handled on a weekly basis. So to summarize: individual goals are set weekly in coordination with the  classroom teacher (via email or face-to-face converstion).  Stand-alone or Integrated services are provided as per the new CR  154. Goals are assessed and discussed weekly before moving on to new goals. We also email more frequently if a specific need  arises, etc. All integrated ENL is in Core Content Areas, and/or, where appropriate ELA studies. Our school uses a Balanced  Literacy approach to learning, so students get consistent literacy input, helping them with Language Arts in English. Home  Language Arts are not applicable, because we do not have the student population to warrant it. As for ELA: Rebecca sees the  Transitioning and Expanding students only when they are studying reading and/or writing.  She coordinates with the classroom  teachers before hand and is familiar with the CCLS for each grade and discusses the learning goals for that week with the  teacher. They make a plan about what to focus on.  As for HLA, we do not provide HLA at PS41.        3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.                   In the stand-alone program, our two beginners receive one-on-one tailored ENL instruction.  For the pre-beginner,  focus is on survival English with direct translations in his HL. For the other beginner who has some conversational English, she  is studying classroom vocabulary so that she can function and follow directions in class, (for example, "line up, I don't  understand, partner, being still, drinking fountain, smart board, cubby, etc.) along with Tier 2 vocabulary for Math, Reading  and Writing vocabulary (for example, dot cube, roll and record, stretching a word, reading like a scientist).  Both students are  working with their first few signt words as well--learning how to recognize, pronounce and spell them (for example, the K  words right now are, a, are, is, in, see and the 5        th       grader is working on common verbs and their conjugations, am, are,  is, be, do, go, like, have). These words are presented in a themed lesson, so they have more meaning to the student, rather  than memorizing lists. In the integrated model, Rebecca pushes in during Reading or Writing Workshops, Word Study, or any  time where ELA is featured in the lesson. She sits with the ELLs when the children break from group discussion, and supports  the learning standard that is being taught with more direct vocabulary instruction as needed, and checking for comprehension,  and asking questions to assess understanding of the learning goal. class, we address a variety of content areas.  Instruction is  divided so that time is spent on specific Math language and Science language, as well as general English language  development.  In addition, because a great deal of PS 41’s curriculum is Social Studies based, during ENL class, Social Studies  themes are addressed.  Students learn vocabulary and language structures that scaffold what they are doing in their  mainstream classrooms.  They also learn language acquisition strategies that help them across the content areas.  For  example, in the ENL classroom we use “word thermometers,” which provide students with a range of vocabulary options for a  particular word/idea (ex. For temperature, we have words like boiling, burning up, scorching, hot, warm, room temperature,  etc.).  The words are related to a variety of topics we cover in class, including content area lessons.  Students are then  responsible for creating their own word thermometers for their mainstream classroom and they keep these in their  folders/notebooks to support independent work.  The multi-faceted approach we use with our ELLs facilitates their access to  classroom learning.             4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?                   The Spanish LAB is given when applicable.  In addition, when standardized tests are administered, we have  translations available when possible and translators available when the DOE does not provide tests in a student's language.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status       Currently we have no SIFE students but if any enroll in our school, they will be invited to attend extended day, small group   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      sessions   for individualized support.  In addition, they will, if assessment suggests they need it, receive support from our AIS (Academic   Intervention Services) team.     ELLs who have been in the U.S. for less than three years are monitored by their classroom teachers and the ENL teacher to  assess   any specific language and cultural understanding barriers.  The teachers regularly discuss their findings in order to develop  tools to   meet individual needs.  The needs are addressed through a variety of language learning methods used in the mainstream and  ENL   classrooms as well as but not limited to lessons about American customs and cultural norms.  These methods help students  become   comfortable around new traditions.  Students’ backgrounds and cultures are celebrated and they are often asked to be  “experts,”   teaching about their specific countries and traditions.        ELLS in grades 3-5 are given test preparation classes in addition to English language instruction.  Skills and strategies that are   required for the test are embedded into the mainstream curriculum so it is part of the students’ everyday learning  experience.    Students are provided with practice material and time is spent teaching “testing language.”   They also do some test prep in  the   ENL classroom.  On the day of the exams, ELLs are provided with the appropriate testing modifications as per testing  mandates.      When we have LEP students receiving between 4 and 6 years of English Language Learning services, members of the LAP team   meet early in the school year to discuss specific academic plans to help these students succeed.  The first thing we do is  analyze the   previous spring’s NYSESLAT results to see in what modality/modalities the student is struggling.  Once that is determined a  course of   action is designed to support the student in the areas (s)he needs.      Former ELLs receive targeted, integrated instruction in small groups during classroom instruction in the Content Area. Content  Areas   include Reading, Writing, Social Studies, Math, Science, and ELA.   Former ELLs, for up to two years after exiting the program are entitled to 90 minutes of ENL support. We currently have six  former   ELLs who are monitored to ensure that their academic Enlgish is on par with their non-ELL peers.   Testing accommodations are mandated for former ELLs for the two years after exiting, so classroom teachers are reminded as  the   NYS testing period nears, and ELLs are provided with extra time to adequately complete the exams.           6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   ELLs identified as having special needs are serviced as per their IEPs.  But ELLs, just by being ELLs, have "special needs" which  are   addressed as the classroom teacher and Rebecca Oyer, the ENL provider, coordinate with each other.  This is done on a  weekly   basis by email or face-to-face consultation.  Rebecca reviews ENL strategies with the classroom teacher, like explicitly teaching  a   tier 2 vocabulary word, rather than the implicit way that non-ELLs can access it. At the same time, the classroom teacher relays   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      the   learning goals for the week, and then Rebecca returns the communication with ideas for making sure the ELLs can access the   information. These strategies include quick, informal check-ins with the students to assess comprehension, making sure the  ELLs have a   nonELL "buddy" in the classroom whom they can go to for support, and making sure that when a new strategy is introduced,  there   are other ways to access the information, like pictures, gestures, etc. Related service providers regularly meet with the ENL   teacher to discuss ways to interweave the strategies each student is being taught, in order to facilitate the student's access  into the   general school curriculum. Technology being used includes an iPad for the pre-beginner.  He can access an online translator.  We   also use the computer in stand-alone class to access pictures to support comprehension, and Quizlet.com, which is a free  online   resource that provides games and assessments in a variety of topics.                 7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Service providers, including the ENL teacher, attend SWD's IEP meetings, in order to determine and plan for helping said  students   achieve their IEP and English acquisition goals. Scheduling of services is carefully coordinated to ensure that ELL-SWDs leave  class at   the least disruptive times.  The ENL portion of their services is provided in the integrated model as much as possible, so that  they can   continue to learn with their peers, with Rebecca's support.          8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  At this time in the school year, we have not identified any ELLs (beyond the SWDs) who need further intervention and support.  But, if an ELL is targeted as needing further services or support, we have a range of intervention services available at PS41.   If reading is found to be below standards, the Reading Recovery services are provided. One to one support: Cycles last  between 12-18 weeks and student meets with teacher 4 times a week for 30 minutes each time.  Early Morning Intervention in Literacy and Mathematics-Small group work with classroom teacher or other qualified faculty  member.  Duration-50 minutes twice a week        At-Risk Math Support-Push-in and pull-out with math specialist. Duration-2 times per week for 10 weeks     In addition, students who are identified as needing at risk support are seen by a SETTS teacher for cycles of 8-12 weeks.     Wilson/Fundations and Orton Gillingham programs( PAF) are offered  three times a week  during word study block and once a  week during independent reading.  This entails small group work with a specialist trained in these programs.      Our ENL teacher meets with all student and families prior to summer break to ensure leaning needs are supported through the  summer.  This includes books to take home, information on summer programs and continuation of writing in their student  journals.  All services are offered in English only.             9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      This year we are continuing to expand our PAF prgoram across grades 1-5. PAF utilizes an Orton Gillingham approach to  learning. The program will focus on grades 1 and 2. We will be adding a summer program where students can come in on  designated days during the summer to meet with a SETSS teacher who will read with them and provide them with new books  to take home in their book baggies.           10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We will not be discontinuing any services.         11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Ells are offered translation services in regard to all school activities-translation of curriculum, parent-teacher meetings, PTA  meetings, school-wide events, afterschool programs and community outreach programs. Families of ELL students are  contacted by the Parent Coordinator and meet with her when they first enter our school. If translation is needed, we provide  that and the PC ensures the families are aware of the many programs during and after the school day that we offer.      Our PTA also contacts and arranges for families to have a “buddy.”  Another PS41 family partners with the new family to help  them navigate the day-to-day questions they may have and helps them get to know the community at large. When possible,  the family is offered a buddy family who speaks the same language.      Lee's Book Club, Chess Club, Enopi tutoring, Steady Buckets- after school program offered to our ELL students.  We host and  after school fair in September to let families know of all the services, groups their child can participate in. Translations services  are available.      The Y runs our after school program and often can assist with translation services.  They publish their brochure in several  different languages.      Each month when our PTA or teachers host events, our parent coordinator and/or school counselors contact families of ELL  students to provide them with details of the events and to arrange for translation services if needed. In addition, our PTA  provides free tickets to evening or weekend events if a family needs assistance.   All students are notified of all programs available to them in a variety of ways: notes backpacked home, the website, letters  from the classroom teachers, letters from the PTA, letters from the Parent Coordinator. Any notes to a family who prefers  written information in another language is translated before giving the information.   As far as we know at this point in the year, one of our ELLs participates in an after school book club twice a week.  And a few of  them participate in the Y after school program--mostly sports oriented. The current Y programs our students are in are:  fencing, basketball, chess and baseball.One student attends the Enopi tutoring program.                   12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  We use an assortment of instructional methods to support ELLs.  In addition, students are provided with other support services  (Speech, AIS Reading) when appropriate.  Students have access to both classroom and school libraries, as well as leveled and  non-leveled (grouped by subject) books in the ENL classroom.  The libraries consist of both fiction and nonfiction texts that  range in reading levels. We use TC units of study in reading and writing. We use Investigations curriculum for math along with  Math in the City units of study as supplemental material.     We use technology throughout the school, in the form of Smart Boards, iPads, computer class.  Ways in which we incorporate  technology specifically for our ELLs are: books on cd (cds are sent home with some students), listening centers, access to  computer programs and language learning websites (in class and at home; the ENL teacher informs parents about helpful   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      websites during her meetings with them.)          13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   As previously noted, we have few ENL students with no two students speaking the same home language.  We do not deliver  native language support.  However, we do have students act as "experts" on their languages and cultures.  They are our  international liaisons and help us promote and celebrate cultural diversity in the school.  In addition, we recommend parents  bolster literacy in their L1 at home.         14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Required services and resources correspond to ELLs ages and grade levels by aligning with the Common Core Standards.  The  ENL teacher regularly has Professional Development sessions with teachers of all grades to ensure that the ENL work being  done is supporting what is going on in the general education classrooms.         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    We use an assortment of instructional methods to support ELLs.  In addition, students are provided with other support services  (Speech, AIS Reading) when appropriate.  Students have access to both classroom and school libraries, as well as leveled and  non-leveled (grouped by subject) books in the ENL classroom.  The libraries consist of both fiction and nonfiction texts that  range in reading levels. We use TC units of study in reading and writing. We use Investigations curriculum for math along with  Math in the City units of study as supplemental material.     We use technology throughout the school, in the form of Smart Boards, iPads, computer class.  Ways in which we incorporate  technology specifically for our ELLs are: books on cd (cds are sent home with some students), listening centers, access to  computer programs and language learning websites (in class and at home; the ENL teacher informs parents about helpful  websites during her meetings with them.)          16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   As soon as families register at our school, the Parent Coordinator meets them and evaluates their needs.  She helps facilitate  diferent things for different families.  In addition to working one-on-one with families to recommend relevant  programs/services, she helps find financial assistance for programs in the school, for families in need.  After registration, families are invited to meet their child’s teacher, to have some time to get information about classroom  procedures.  Families are also brought up to date regarding any notices, newsletters and handouts given out prior to that point  in the year (if the school year has already started). Families are also signed up for our school website by the Parent  Coordinator, and she ensures they have an account ID and password set up, so they can access all materials related to the  school and community. Our school website translates materials into many languages, and this is shown during the PC  meeting.            17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    We do not offer language electives.         18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49         d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Not applicable.        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Our ENL teacher attends monthly PD with our District ENL Field Support Team.  In addition, she has attended out of network  ENL PD at Teachers College  Rebecca Oyer, the ENL instructor, and Susan Ngai in the ELA support team who also is also ESL certified, will direct some of the  PD throughout the year.  We will also provide insight on how other PD also supports ELLs.  This will be done throughout the  year.  For example, many of the ELA teaching principles are also ENL principles--anytime academic language is introduced, the  same language acquisition strategies can be employed.   All personnel at the school who interact with the ELLs will be provided with the PD that Rebecca or Susan conducts, in addition  to any other PD that is relevant throughout the year.  This includes the paraprofessional for our ELL-SWD, the school  secretaries, our Parent Coordinator, the common branch teachers for all the ELLs in our school, and our two assistant  principals.        At monthly PDs facilitated by the Field Support Team, information regarding supporting ENLs as they engage in the Common  Core Learning Standards is given and discussed at length.  In school PD, Rebecca and/or Susan present the information  received from the Field Support Team.  Focusing on reaching the CCLS for all learners, also addresses the needs of ELLs, and  Rebecca and/or Susan will continue to highlight this fact: that ELA and ENL are two parts of the same whole--language  acquistion needed for academic success. Examples of our professional development learning opportunities are as follows:  •               Literacy/Math Grade Meeting (every week)  •               Inquiry-based Teacher Team Meetings (Weekly Monday PDs)  •               In-house TC Study Groups (K-5)  •               Outside PDs: TC Calendar Days   •               Outside PDs: TC specialty groups  •               ICT study groups with Gold Mansour & Rutherford (K-5)  •               PreK workshops at the district office (3-5 time a year)  •               District #2 ENL Workshops (Fall, Winter and Spring)  •               Chancellor's Day PD (September, November, June)  •               End of Year Literacy/Math Planning          2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Our middle school liaison, Mr. Robert Caputo meets with each family individually to walk them through the middle school  process and to discuss the range of programs offered in District 2. A translator for the parent (or the Translation Unit) is  available for the parent/guardian. In addition, Mr. Caputo works with each fifth grade teacher when completing applications  for middle schools and meets with every class to go over the school choices they have. Rebecca Oyer or Susan Ngai privide Mr.  Caputo with ELL strategies to use during his interactions with ELL families.  These include speaking slowly, using common  words, using the documents and other realia to support their understanding of the material, and allowing for any follow up  meetings needed for further comprehension.       Because this is a new requirement, we will be finding our way in the 2015-16 school year.  Also, because our ENL population is   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50         steadily between 1% and 2% of the whole school's population, it will be difficult to rationalize spending 15% of PD time on ENL  training.  It is predicted that if the motion to change 154.2 goes through, which allows schools such as ours to request yearly  exemption from this requirement, we will pursue that option. In the meantime, the ENL instructor will present PD materials to  the staff during regular PD meetings which occur on Monday afternoons. As for 50% of the PD for the ENL instructor, this will  be fulfilled by attending network PD and any other available options that are offerred by the ENL achievement  coach/department.         Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   At PS 41, Wednesday mornings at 8:00 are designated for parent engagement time. This information is relayed to all parents at  the beginning of the year. At approximately mid-year, the ENL teacher will schedule the required individual annual meetings  with the parents during the 8:00 time allotment, unless inconvenient to the parent/guardian, at which time another more  convenient time will be scheduled.  Before the meeting, the ENL instructor will check-in with the classroom teacher to discuss  any areas that (s)he feels should be highlighted during the meeting. During the annual meeting, all goals, progress, assessment  results and continued needs in all content areas will be discussed. A translator will be available, or the Translation and  Interpretation Unit will be accessed during the meeting, if the language is a low-incidence one for which we have not been  able to find a translator.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  PS 41 does not have a large ELL population (though there are many children who are bilingual). We are fortunate to be able to  take advantage of our strong community and the effective and top-notch resources we provide to all 41 families in a way that  integrates, engages and assimilates the ELL population we have.  Our ELL population uniformly has access to computer and e-mail.  We have an exceptional school website on which every family has an account and is able to access thorough and interactive  information on all school functions and events, individual class pages, extracurricular activities, community affairs, DOE  mandates and deadlines, afterschool programs, neighborhood and city resources, all calendars, emergency and safety  information and many, many other things. The website can be translated into different languages.  As soon as a family registers, we connect them to the website. As well, if we make any kind of determination that the family  requires translation services, we make sure that for vital things such as Parent-Teacher Conferences, those services are  available.     The Parent Coordinator maintains e-mail lists for each grade and sends out information frequently; all families are available  through e-mail. In certain cases where there has been a significant language barrier, the Parent Coordinator has facilitated a  “translator” who is also added to the e-mail list and who can translate all pertinent information to the family.  We have a very proactive and dynamic PTA which maintains a Class Parent system. Each class has at least 2 Class Parents—the  Class Parents also maintain e-mail lists and they send out frequent e-mails that target the specific needs of that class. The Class  Parents alert the Parent Coordinator to any family in which they feel a language or other barrier is present and the Parent  Coordinator makes individual, concerted efforts to engage the family. The Class Parents make sure that each family in the class  is invited to all events (each class does its own “Pot Luck” dinner each fall which provides a wonderful opportunity for all  families in the class to socialize and get to know one another) and the Parent Coordinator makes sure that any family with a  financial hardship receives complimentary admission to any event.  PS 41 is committed to making every family part of our community.             2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51      Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.

Question C2 does not allow for a response to be posted directly below it. Record  keeping of annual individual ENL meetings: The ENL instructor will keep copies of all records used and relayed to parents during  this meeting. These notes and records will be placed in the same folder kept for information from Part IV, #10 (placement letters,  etc.).                             2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.                     In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Kelly Shannon, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:         PS41                                                                                  School DBN:   Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

Yes/No       (*Primary)             * The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs  on translation,   interpretation, compliance and budget.      School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      We do a number of things to assess parent language preference here at 41 . We pull information from the HLS as  well as from a parent language preference form given at the initial parent-ENL teacher information session, that  requests parent language preferences for oral and written information. We also run the RAPL report on ATS to  corroborate the information we have and we make sure our emergency contact forms list parent language  preferences. The school ensures that all parents are provided with appropriate and timely information in a  language they can understand. All families enrolling students into our school complete a home language survey.  This provides us with information regarding what languages parents write and speak at home. Michele Farinet,  our Parent Coordinator, is in contact with all families to ensure that they receive the necessary translation  services. Our guidance counselors also reach out to non-English speaking families to make sure the school is  meeting their needs. Families complete the Learning Environment Survey and our own School Leadership Team  survey. These surveys inquire and assess how well our school communicates information with all families. Class  parent representatives communicate with teachers and families consistently throughout the year. Teachers   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      provide feedback regarding the needs of their students’ families so that important documents, notices, and  meetings are translated and interpreted.We will create a report that we update regularly with the languages that  parents speak, by class and grade.We can collect data through Blue Cards and Parent Surveys.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     Written Preferred    Percent Written          Oral Preferred    Percent Oral          Language    This year all parents  indicated English,  except one who  requested written  materials in Mandarin.            3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.            Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services    1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be   distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.      Document Name    Month/Frequency Distributed to   How do you plan to translate?   Families    Include procedures to ensure timely  provision of translated documents      to parents.
