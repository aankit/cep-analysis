This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      West Side Collaborative Middle School (WSC) seeks to build student independence by providing engaging learning  experiences that support students so they can analyze, synthesize, and take ownership of their learning to move  towards independence and self-advocacy.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    School staff works closely in collaborative teams to develop curricula across content areas that allow students to  demonstrate their understanding and make their thinking visible. Student digital portfolios and student-led  conferences are school-wide practices that support students in articulating learning goals, reflecting on their body of  work, and articulating ideas about their learning to parents and peers.   The school community aligns curricula to the Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS) though strategic planning done  in collaboration within the school’s content area teacher teams and grade level team meetings. The school schedule  provides time for weekly grade level humanities teams and math teams to meet to refine curricula. The school  community recognizes that each student has their own unique learning profile and works in collaboration to develop  curriculum that is aligned to the CCLS and is also responsive to the specific needs of each learner in the school  community.   Literacy teacher teams utilize resources from the Department of Education recommended Expeditionary Learning  curriculum as well as Columbia University’s Teachers College Reading and Writing Workshop to develop a year-long  curriculum for students which addresses the CCLS with an emphasis on critical thinking and textual analysis. The  teams utilize data from state exams and teacher-developed periodic assessments to identify high leverage areas of  instructional focus. Literacy leaders from each grade team meet periodically with coaches and consultants to reflect  on development of curriculum to ensure common practices across grade levels to support reading comprehension  strategies.   The math teacher team utilizes resources from EngageNY and Connected Math to develop their CCLS aligned year- long curriculum across grade levels. Within meetings, the math team utilizes data from state exams and teacher  developed periodic assessments to identify high leverage areas of instructional focus for each grade. In addition to the  core curriculum, teachers also develop curriculum for weekly focus classes where students are grouped based on  analysis of assessment data for targeted instruction that support students’ needs for academic intervention and/or  enrichment in relation to specific learning standards.   Teacher leaders support the professional learning community at WSC through developing inter-visitation cycles and  post-visit de-briefing sessions for staff emphasizing high leverage instructional strategies aligned to school goals.  Teacher leaders meet weekly with school leadership to support implementation of school wide-initiatives to support  student academic achievement. Teacher teams also collaborate with consultants from Teaching Matters to engage in  practices supporting use of assessments and the online assessment tool, Mastery Connect. Teaching Matters  consultants also collaborate with teachers in developing aspects of the school’s online portfolio structure. WSC also  collaborates with NYCDOE's Mastery Collaborative Program which supports WSC's work in implementing mastery  based grading practices as culturally responsive teaching practices to enhance the school's ability to provide a  supportive learning environment.   West Side Collaborative also has partnerships with organizations such as Urban Advantage to support student access  to hands on learning and science institutions across the city. As part of the school’s science curriculum, students  engage in a week-long science course where they study topics such as human biology, hydrology, ethology, and  rocketry using the principles of inquiry based learning. The school also has engaged in partnerships with The Whitney  Museum of American Art as part of the school’s arts curriculum.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Over 28% of students have IEPS and over 5% of our students are English Language Learners. Grade level teacher  teams and special education teachers work in collaboration to ensure instruction meets the needs of all learners  through flexible groupings and needed modifications and supports that facilitate student achievement.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Two areas where West Side Collaborative Middle School has made progress are Collaborative Teachers and  Supportive Environment. Teachers collaborate to develop curriculum that supports students in setting academic  goals, reflecting on and revising student work, and creating dynamic and engaging portfolio presentations. Teachers  have also engaged in professional learning cycles in relation to culturally responsive teaching practices and have made  curricular modifications to support students' opportunity to make meaningful connections with the curriculum. In the  area of Collaborative Teachers the school has continued to make progress in creating a strong culture of learning for  parents, students, and teachers. Teacher leaders work in concert with school leadership to develop comprehensive  professional learning plans to support WSC's instructional foci and teachers' professional goals. Teachers have  collaborated in teams to engage in inquiry based inter-visitation cycles to support professional practice and promote  sharing of best instructional practices amongst the teaching staff.   One area of focus for West Side Collaborative Middle School is Rigorous Instruction. Based on feedback from the  School Quality Guide and teacher observation data, one high leverage instructional goal is to ensure that all student  subgroups, including ELLs and SWDs, receive appropriate instructional supports and opportunities to engage in quality  student discussions and targeted instruction to support academic achievement. The core teacher team, in  collaboration with the principal, are developing the professional learning plan for teachers to support school progress  with this goal.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 03M250   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   178   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Teachers have participated in Assessment Matters trainings and Mastery Collaborative trainings during the 2015-16  and 2016-17 school years. Many staff members and are trained in the practice of aligning assessments to the CCLS  across content areas. These staff members are leading colleagues’ work in the area of effective use of assessments to  inform instruction. Teacher leaders collaborate with consultants from Teaching Matters to evaluate and refine  teacher team practices regarding use of student assessments. As a Teacher Incentive Fund School, Peer Collaborative  Teachers and Model Teachers work with DOE support staff and principal to design professional learning plans for  teachers. Teacher teams engage in the process of norming grades on assessments to build a common understanding  of grade level work. Assessment data is used to inform instruction, groupings, and interventions. Teacher leaders are  part of the cabinet and help set policies. Teacher teams work collaboratively on curriculum and common  expectations.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40        Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. West Side Collaborative , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A  of the Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent  involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the  families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision- making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School  Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of  the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   West Side Collaborative Middle School will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Teacher-created assessments as well as Degrees of Reading Power Assessments are used in accessing the early literacy skills of  our ELLs. ELLs have one self-contained class a week, known within the school as the ENL Personal Learning Module (PLM).  Upon entry into West Side Collaborative, students are given a series of persuasive, informational, narrative writing tasks. The  writing tasks are given school-wide and are based on the Teacher's College model of persuasive, informational, and narrative  writing tasks. The ELL Coordinator, Bradford DiPietro, reviews these results and determines if the students will need the  additional one-on-one ENL classes or if they will remain with the pull-out/push-in model throughout their coursework and  studies and the PLM class. This information is also decided based on the students' level of ELL status and minutes required.      Data gathered in the ENL PLM class greatly impacts the school's instructional plan.  WSC also uses the Diagnostic Reading Assessments along with informal assessments and classroom observation to assess the  specific needs of ELL students.  This impacts WSC's instructional plan as ELLs are placed into sub-groups based on their skills in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50         speaking listening reading, and writing modalities.  Students are grouped in mixed grade instructional groups based on their  proficiency levels for cycles of targeted instruction.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Common planning time is provided in the fall for teacher teams to assess data with the ENL Coordinator to identify patterns,  trends and instructional needs for WSC's ELLs.  Teams are also provided time within the school day to engage in  instructional modifications based on student learning data.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Degrees of Reading Power and Teacher Created Performance Tasks and grade level baselines and mid year assessments.           4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Dedicated periods throughout the week are programmed to provide targeted instruction to ENL students aligned to learning  needs identified trhough assessment data.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A  - MS250 is a middle school         6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].        7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The ENL coordinator meets with principal to review state data and NYSESLAT data to identify data trends and measure  progress on the individual student and group level.  ENL teacher uses the NYSED ENL blueprint to evaluate and refine ENL  curriculum and learning activities.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   The organizational models followed at West Side Collaborative are a combination of push- ins and pull- outs from  both General   and CTT classes. The ELL Coordinator/ENL teacher, Bradford Di Pietro, pushes into scheduled grade level, inclusive  classes throughout  the week. In these classes, it is predetermined that the ELLs sit close to one another and in the front of the classroom.  When pushed  into a main content class, the ELLs are set to the standard of the rest of the class; they follow the agenda of the whole  class i.e. TTQ  as a starting question, the mini-lesson, and the workshop time. The ELL Coordinator sits alongside the ELLs in class to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51      ensure they  are understanding directions and staying focused and on task. Since the ELL Coordinator is made privy to the day's  lessons and  workshops before the lesson is executed, multiple differentiation pieces are considered. **This year, in accordance  with the  "integrated ELL Most importantly, with reading, the ENL program, teachers received a "Integrating ELLs into your  Classroom" guide  made exclusively by the ENL teacher for WSC teachers.  In addition to the teachers having this knowledge, the  coordinator modifies   the texts by including vocabulary. Similarly, in a science or history class, visuals are commonly provided for the ELL  students.     In the pull-out setting, the ELL students are taken either individually, in pairs, or as a whole class grade ELL group (that  is, all 6  th  graders, all 7th graders, all 8th graders) to work out of the classroom. Individual pull-outs usually include Independent  Reading time  with the ELL Coordinator, where students get to practice pronunciation and fluency. This is also an ideal time to  individually check for  understanding in the student's progress with reading comprehension and vocabulary building. This time also servces  as a way to  develop a more close-knit relationship between the ELL and the ELL Coordinator. These informal conferences are ideal  coaching and  teachable moments. When pulled-out as pairs, these students have been coupled because they are struggling with  the same details,  albeit the introduction of their essay or similar grammar struggles. Lastly, in whole grade ELL group pull-outs, the  groups are small  enough where working on an in-class project is ample workshop time. This time is also crucial for Read Alouds,  facilitated by the ELL  Coordinator. In group ELL time, collective stories are read and dissected. Again, this is quality time to check for  understanding of the  ELLs progress. It also aids in creating future NYSESLAT test practice packets for fundamental skills i.e. grammar and  reading lessons  tailor made to the ELLs' current needs.      To ensure that the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels, the ELL  Coordinator/teacher, Bradford DiPietro, meets with grade team teachers to develop a schedule that accommodates  the mandated  minutes.  Per CR Part 154, Beginning ENL students at the Beginning/Entering and Low Intermediate/Emerging receive  180 minutes  of standalone ENL instruction per week as well as an additional 180 minutes of integrated ENL services.  Students  above these  levels receive above their required 180 minutes of integrated ENL time, as well as individual standalone minutes that  are conducted  in conferences within the ENL PLM and Focus time.       b.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?        In order to best serve our ESL students while maintaining appropriate relevancy to the content areas, the ENL teacher  meets with grade team teachers to develop a comprehensive curriculum which both addresses the content being covered in  class as well as adapts and modifies content when necessary.  As WSC provides a Free- Standing ENL program to its ELL  population, the majority of instruction is delivered in English.  A small number of CTT students receive additional services with  a bilingual English-Spanish paraprofessional. *To reiterate what was answered in question 1 of this section, all WSC teachers  received a PD and "Inclusion" guide to integrate ELLs into their classroom for the 2017-2018 school year that will be updated  by the ELL Coordinator, Bradford DiPietro, as time goes on and changes or supplementary materials are deemed necessary to  add.         3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      WSC uses a hands-on workshop model in ELA that provides students with the opportunity to explore literacy in both reading  and writing across content areas.  Through the use of targeted mini- lessons and conferring, students are assisted in  developing and enhancing their skills as readers and writers so that they may meet the New Common Core Standards of  becoming independent, self- directed learners.  To ensure that ELL students receive the instruction they need to advance,  students are given both formal and informal assessments to determine their strengths and needs.  They also receive small- group targeted instruction to support their learning.  During students' designated Independent Reading time which is  configured into every grade level, the ELL Coordinator uses this time to do individual conferencing with the ELLs to practice  reading aloud. Sheltered English is used across content areas.     In addition, ELL students use multi- media tools to enhance their understanding of vocabulary, reading and writing. Since WSC  is serious about teaching Common Core Standards and preparing our students to be proper and upstanding "21st Century"  citizens, then access to technology and self-discovery through technology is a priority. Technology aids such as Google Docs,  word processors, Power Point presentations and videos contribute to building strong literacy skills. L     In Social Studies, ELL students are assigned projects that help them develop a hands-on understanding of the time periods  studied.  Students are able to work in small groups, encouraging both team- building and a solid understanding of key  concepts.  As students work, teachers offer guidance and help them increase understanding through the use of conferring and  multi- media tools such as video- streaming and Google Docs.  Students are able to make autonomous decisions about their  learning, freely choosing to focus upon particular sub- groups throughout history for special and individualized projects.     Science is currently offered three times per week at 70  minutes per period (210 weekly minutes).  Instruction is delivered in a  setting which enables students to be both inquisitive and kinesthetic learners.  Students are introduced to scientific concepts  and exploration while applying English language usage to lab report- writing and the promotion of content- specific language  and vocabulary.  All students are responsible for active participation in investigatory science explorations as guided by the  classroom teacher.  Students work towards acquiring the appropriate knowledge of scientific concepts and methodology, as  well as independent and self- directed production of content- relevant work.          4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      To ensure ELLs are appropriately tested in their native language, state tests will be offered in the students' native language  should it be deemed necessary by the ELL Coordinator, by the parents, and by the ELL. However, to date, no ELL has taken the  state tests in any language other than English.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status     Differentiated instruction is acknowledged amongst all ELL subgroups.  To ensure learner success, each student is assessed by  the  ELL Coordinator and team teachers, and his or her needs are identified.  Teachers work in small groups with these students to  provide the necessary instruction for meaningful, autonomous learning.  Our staff is trained in using differentiation strategies  and  tools to support students at the various levels. For testing all students receive flexibility in setting, timing, and scheuduling.  All  students also have are accommodated by having questions read aloud to them.  Students also have access to a translation  dictionary /glossary.        6 a. In conjunction with the classroom teachers, the ELL Coordinator works to establish a foundational understanding of the  SIFE  student's L1 literacy (as well as level of proficiency in the target language).  Each SIFE student is delivered a curriculum  developed  by the student's teachers and parents.  Instructional plans are developed on a case by case basis, with the student receiving a  combination of push- in and pull- out services from the ELL Coordinator and the other necessary support staff.  Educational  plans for  SIFE students are highly individualized and are created with consideration to the academic and emotional needs of the  students.     6 b. Newcomers receive a combination of push- in and pull- out services with the ELL Coordinator and other necessary support  staff.   Per CR Part 154, students receive the mandated number of support units as determined by their NYSITELL / NYSESLAT  scores.  They  are assessed through both informal and formal assessments in- school, as well as periodically through borough assessments  for ELLs.   Newcomers are able to enhance their skills through a comprehensive ELA/ ENL program which strives for inclusion as well as  seeks to  improve cultural awareness.     6 c. For ELLs receiving services 4 to 6 years, a greater focus is placed on developing cognitive academic language  proficiency.  Per  CR Part 154, students receive the mandated number of support units as determined by their NYSESLAT scores.  They receive a  combination of push- in and pull- out services with the ELL Coordinator and other necessary support staff.  ELLs receiving  services 4  to 6 years are assessed through both informal and formal assessment in- school, as well as periodically through borough  assessments for ELLs.  They are able to enhance their skills through a comprehensive ELA/ ENL program which strives for  inclusion as  well as seeks to improve cultural awareness.       6 d. The instructional goals for Long- Term ELLs are to both enhance mastery of the English language as well as provide  students  with the guidance to become autonomous speakers of the target language.  Per CR Part 154, students receive the mandated  number of support units as determined by their NYSESLAT scores.  They receive a combination of push- in and pull- out  services with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      the ELL Coordinator and other necessary support staff.  Long- Term ELLs are assessed through both informal and formal  assessment  in- school, as well as periodically through borough assessment for ELLs.  Additionally, West Side Collaborative provides  interventions for students being designated at- risk.       Throughout the day, support services in ELA and ENL instruction are provided through a comprehensive push- in/ pull- out  model.  At  risk students receive 1:1 services with the ENL teacher, who reinforces literacy through a variety of programs such as Wilson  Reading and writer’s workshops.  The ESL teacher also pushes into Humanities  blocks, offering the students support and skills for reading comprehension and writing.  A variety of materials including leveled  books in both fiction and non- fiction genres are available in the classroom library.  Students are given both whole- class as  well as  individual “Just Right” books to read. WSC uses a hands-on workshop model in ELA that provides students with the  opportunity to  explore literacy in both reading and writing.  Through the use of targeted mini- lessons and conferring with both classroom  teachers  and the ENL teacher, students are assisted in developing and enhancing their skills as readers and writers so that they may  meet the  New Common Core Standards.  To ensure that ELL students receive the instruction they need to advance, students are given  both  formal and informal assessments to determine their strengths and needs.  They also receive small- group targeted instruction  to  support their learning.  In addition, ELL students use multi-media tools to enhance their understanding of vocabulary, reading  and  writing.  Through the use of Google Docs, word processors, Power Point presentations and videos, students build their literacy  skills     6e. Former ELLs receive the same testing accommodations for two years after services. Also, students who passed the  NYSESLAT but  are submitted for possible "re-evaluation" from their teachers will spend time in the ENL groupings.                6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   The ENL and CTT teachers meet to plan lessons and identify specific strategies to be used to support the development of the  necessary skills for students with special needs.  Based on students' performance levels as indicated on the Individualized  Education Plan, appropriate resources and strategies are implemented into each child's learning program.  Middle school  appropriate ELL educational texts have been purchased and are used to ensure that students have access to age appropriate  materials to accellerate each child's English language development.  Students receive the mandated number of support units  as determined by their NYSESLAT scores.  All ELLs identified as having special needs are served per their IEPs. This year, with  the onset of more advanced technology at WSC, iPad programs are being used to enhance the teachings of the ENL and CTT  teachers. For example, an ELL may start creating flash cards on "First Words" or "Baby Carrot" with the ENL teacher and these  same visual and recorded definitions and lessons will be supplemented and continued with the CTT teachers.           7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  ELL students at West Side Collaborative have the opportunity to be educated alongside their general education peers. The  classes   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      at WSC are not tracked. Although all ELLs are placed in the same ELA (Readers and Writers) classes, they experience a wide  range of diverse classes throughout the school day. At WSC, we believe the most appropriate and comfortable setting for ELLs  at any level is alongside their peers in the classroom. As previously mentioned, the push-in and pull-out dynamic of classes at  WSC is expected by the students (not even just the ELLs, as there are enrichment programs that push-in and pull-out as well).  To be pulled out of a classroom is not stigmatized by the students, as at one point or another, every student, albeit general ed,  CTT, or ELL, is pulled from the classroom. Similarly, with the constant presence of the ELL Coordinator, students come to  recognize this teacher as another adult and teacher in the room.                8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  WSC uses an interdisciplinary model in ELA, Social Studies and Science that provides students with the opportunity to explore  literacy by both reading and writing across content areas.  Through the use of targeted mini- lessons and conferring, students  are assisted in developing and enhancing their skills as readers and writers so that they may meet the New Common Core  Standards of becoming independent, self- directed learners.  To ensure that ELL students receive the instruction they need to  advance, students are given both formal and informal assessments to determine their strengths and needs.  They also receive  small- group targeted instruction to support their learning.  In addition, ELL students use multi- media tools to enhance their  understanding of vocabulary, reading and writing.  Technology aids such as Google Docs, word processors, Power Point  presentations and videos contribute to building strong literacy skills. iPad student activities are also introduced.      In math, formal and informal assessments are used to determine ELL students’ specific needs.  These needs are then addressed  through targeted interventions such as push- ins and pull- outs with the math coaches and ELL Coordinator.  In addition,  students are compelled to reflect upon their own needs as learners.  Teachers use students’ insights to support their learning  and integrate multiple intelligences.  The ELL Coordinator works with the classroom teachers to ensure that students  understand and master state content.        9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Blended learning and meaningful use of technology and online resources at WSC will continue to permit ELL students to work  at a self-guided pace and for them to have resources available through the Internet and the Teacher, but ultimately have a  gradual release of responsibility to challenge them as they work towards proficency in grade level learning standards and  skills.         10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?    No programs will be discontinued.                 11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELL students are offered equal access to all school programs. ELLs are included in all field trips, advisory, arts, science, dance,  and performing arts clubs and the school's DYCD after school program which is provided by CityParks Foundation. Within the  after school program all students including ELLs receive homework tutoring and the opportunity to engage in STEM and arts  activities.  By receiving ENL services from a licensed ENL teacher that are targeted for small group instruction and supports  their learning, ELLs are encouraged to remain involved and interactive in school culture and activities. Flyers, permission slips  and robo calls are shared in the ELLs home language to inform and invite students and families to participate in school  programs.   Parent workshops are delivered and Spanish.  The parent coordinator works closely with families to ensure that  translators are provided as needed.          12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56          Technology and multi- media is used in various modalities to enhance teaching.  A school- wide online supportive website is  used to help students understand math concepts.  Power Speak, an online language program, is used to build understanding of  language.   Students also have access to a dictionary of their native language and English (i.e. Spanish/English, Arabic/English)  in every room. Formal and informal assessments are used to identify ELL students’ needs and in consultation with the ESL  teacher, classroom teachers confer with ENL students about these needs to support growth.  Academic intervention services  are offered and students are programmed for small group instruction to support their learning.          13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   As WSC provides a free- standing ENL program to its ENL population, the majority of instruction is delivered in English.  A small  number of CTT students receive additional services with a bilingual English- Spanish paraprofessional.                  14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.     All required services support and resources correspond to ELLs' ages and grade levels. ENL teacher utilizes student data to  ensure services and resources are appropriate to each student's age and grade level.          15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    School Based Support team works with staff from both schools when assessing students' learning needs.           16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   All new students are given a welcome orientation to the school.  ELLs are paired up with buddies to help them acclimate to life  at WSC as well as life in New York.  Teacher- student communication is open and consistent; we believe in demonstrating  passion for learning and compassion for our students. Homeroom at the start of every day is an opportunity for students to  take part in the "Grab and Go" Breakfast program, socialize with their friends, receive notices to bring home (which are always  offered in the students'/parents' preferred language), and reach out to content teachers. Office hours are also an opportunity  for students to informally discuss academic issues with their Academic Coach. The ELL Coordinator is the academic (Base  Camp) coach for all ELLs, which provides many additional hours of ELL services throughout the year.                 17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Power Speak, an online language program, is offered in five different languages: French, Spanish, Italian, Mandarin, and  Japanese.  All WSC students are afforded the opportunity to use the program during the school day during their Explorations  period, in after-school programs, and at home.                  18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A - WSC is Freestanding ENL       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The school's approach for Professional development is inclusive, and includes opportunities for teachers and staff to receive  resources for supporting ELLs throughout the year The professional learning plan includes the following:      2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  The school guidance counselor meets with the principal, ENL coordinator and parent coordinator to discuss individualized  needs of entering ELLs to create an action plan to support each student and implement next steps  for implementation by  teachers or  non-instructional staff.   All WSC teacher serve as academic coaches and advisors and receive training to support  students in their transition to middle school. The guidance counselor and ENL coordinator have reviewed the Dignity for All  Students Act and collaborate with teachers to develop lessons and activities for students as part of the school's social  emotional learning curriculum.  The guidance counselor, parent coordinator and ENL coordinator join teacher team meetings  to share pertinent information that can support  our ELLs in their transition to middle school.      The ELL Coordinator attends district and borough trainings and professional learning to support ELL instruction and ENL  programs.  The ELL Coordinator turnkeys information in Professional Development days. She also integrates herself into pre- planning for units for the entire year, which contributes to all staff's minimum hour requirements. Records for this process and  sharing between ELL Coordinator and General Ed/ICT teachers is completed through Google Documents and Google  Spreadsheets. The unit planners for each class are updated on a daily basis. This enables the ELL Coordinator to go into each  grade's academic planning and contribute differentiated materials for ELLs. The ELL Coordinator is also embedded into "Team  Meetings" once a week - an hour a week - to offer feedback about differentiated materials for upcoming lessons. Agendas  and  records of ELL professional development are logged in an online form shared with school staff and personnel. Attendance  for meetings is logged and kept in the school's main office.                 Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Since the ELL Coordinator is the Base Camp coach of all ELL students, communication between parents is constant because of  "Parent Office Hours" and student-led-conferences.  When parents come in for mandated student-led conferences, they have  the oppportuniy to speak with the ENL coordinator and to schedule and additional meeting with the ELL Coordinator at an  additional time during parent office hours.  During parent office hours additional information about students is shared with  families. Students' NYSESLAT scores as well as their baseline to benchmark scores are shared with the parents. Students'  academic goals for the end of the academic school year will be set by the ELL Coordinator and clearly outlined to the parents.      Provisions for interpretation and translation are followed the same way the initial parent meeting is held; in-house speakers of  the language are present for the meeting and when there is a language in need of translation the NYC DOE Translation  department is called.          2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   There is an orientation for incoming parents facilitated in English and Spanish.  WSC has a PTA that runs workshops on  adolescent development and academic success throughout the year. These are conducted by the Parent Coordinator,  and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         translation services are provided. At the annual grade level "Curriculum Night," the school hosts "parent walks" where parents  get a glimpse of what their child experiences in a classroom setting. Parents are invited to volunteer, albeit for field trips or  school events.  We distribute monthly newsletters which are translated  for our bilingual families to keep them informed about  events at WSC. Content area classes, such as math, also send home a monthly newsletter to parents to inform them of the unit  their child is currently studying. Our automated calling system translates messages.  High school articulation workshops  provide an opportunity for parents to prepare for the application process and translation services are available.  Flyers are sent  out in multiple languages and communication is always open.  Information is also send digitally to students and parents  digitally via email.      Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Novella Bailey, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.

Yes/No         * The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs  on translation,   interpretation, compliance and budget.      School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      West Side Collaborative fosters a close-knit relationship amongst parents*, educators, and students throughout a  student's career at WSC. Therefore, it is our priority to ensure parents are provided with appropriate and timely  information in a language they can understand. At the beginning of the school year, parents are given the NYC  DOE "Preferred Language" hand out, even if they have already filled this out in previous years. We are aware that  home langauge preference is also available on ATS, but it is important to keep this information updated, as  students' home situations often change. By updating a family's home language at the beginning of every academic  year in ATS and on the student's blue emergency card, it is on file for the school year what language all parent and  guardian newsletters, hand-outs, conversations, etc. should be articulated in. This information is gathered within  the first two weeks of the academic year and filed in the main office. In addition, additional information about  families' language preference noticed in interactions between staff and families during our orientation , curriculm  night, and other school events is shared with office staff, guidance and PC and added to school records to inform  parent communication and translation needed.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62      Our most recent ATS report indicates the following home language data for our school population:   18% Spanish   3% Arabic   1% Haitian Creole   1% French   .5% Fench Haitain Creole   .5%Chinese   .5% Bengali   Our greatest population of non-English speaking parents and guardians are Spanish speaking. There are a number  of Spanish speaking educators on staff who are readily available for translation. There is always someone in the  main office who can speak Spanish such as our parent coordinator, as well as paraprofessionals in classes with  students who require the service. Should a household require another language other than English, Spanish, or  French (spoken by the LAC, Stephanie Caruso), the "Translation & Interpretation Unit" number is readily available  in the office. The plaque displaying the phone number is hanging on the Parent Coordinator's desk with the  language indication card directly below (I'm a parent and I speak…).The Translation & Interpretation Unit services  will be utilized should another langauge other than English, Spanish, or French be necessary to communicate with  parents and guardians. An outside translator will be sought to aid in communication for the duration of the school  year to ensure equal opportunity for obtaining school and community information.   *As delineated by the NYC DOE, "The term 'parent,' whenever used in this regulation, means the student's  parent(s) or guardian(s), or any person(s) in a parental or custodial relationship to the student, or the student, if  he/she is an emancipated minor or has reached 18 years of age"           2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     Written  Preferred       Percent  Written       Oral Preferred    Percent Oral          Language    Languages preferred for written and oral  communication include English, Bengali,  Chinese, French, French-Haitian Creole,  Haitian Creole, Arabic and Spanish.            3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu).
