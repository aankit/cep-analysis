The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7     In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           8       NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           10         1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Section 4: SCEP Overview      Collaborative Arts Middle School, CAMS, (29Q355) was founded in the fall of 2011 with a three-prong focus on  scholarship, artistry, and service. Our mission is to cultivate scholars, life-long artists, and community activists in an  environment that respects the specific developmental needs of the middle school learner. For CAMS, the arts  encourage, inspire, and support academic inquiry, while service learning allows students to apply their scholastic and  artistic talents to community needs. Believing that "he who waits to be asked has waited too long," we are dedicated  to providing our students with opportunities to give back to the world from which they benefit.      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    In conjunction with our staff and wonderful families, we utilize the support of many organizations to provide our  students with learning and personal opportunities. We maintain a partnership with Music Theater International  (MTI), which supports the production of our annual musical. Additionally, Price Waterhouse Cooper (PWC) works  with our seventh grade population to enhance the content of financial literacy course. The seventh grade  population is also supported in the College Access for All mission through our partnership with I Will Graduate. Our  relationship with 105th Precinct of the NYC Police Department affords us sessions on bullying. Working with  LIVERespect gives our Boys' Group access to a pilot curriculum on a program that will engage boys in ending  violence and discrimination against women and girls. In order to engage the girls, we use the Pretty Brown Girls  curriculum to empower our young ladies. With the help of community based organizations, we were able to  provide our students with dental and vision screening.    Additionally we have adopted of the Response to Intervention (RTI) structure to address the academic and  behavioral needs of our students. One policy utilized is a focus on choosing to use a Restorative Justice approach to  encourage conflict resolution over suspension. Furthermore, we use Google Classroom within our humanities  (ELA/SS) and science departments. In preparing students for high school, we offer audition preparation and the  Alegbra I regents exam.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Our school serves the Tri-Community (Laurelton, Rosedale, and Springfield Gardens) section of southeast Queens. We  are a Title I school and as such, 73% of our children are eligible for free and/or reduced lunch. Our student population  largely originates from across the African Diaspora (86%). We are nearly even split with young ladies making up 52%  and young men making up 48% of our population.    On each grade, we maintain a minimum of one honors class for students with a focus on math acceleration. Our  school’s special needs population is 23%. As a result, we serve students along the Special Needs Continuum from  related services to self-contained with the assistance of one-to-one crisis paraprofessional. the majority of our Special  Needs students are either in ICT or self-contained class settings. Additionally, we serve a transient population, with  12% of students living in temporary housing situations.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           64        Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           65      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Collaborative Arts Middle School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title  I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent  involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the  families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and  decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the  School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed  members of the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students  Collaborative Arts Middle School will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement  level, e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology;  ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning  and decision making in support of the education of their children;  ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support  and monitor their child’s progress;  ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;  ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format,  and in languages that parents can understand;       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           66         ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to  improve outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between  parents and other members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement    Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of  the school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School  Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their  members for additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the  school’s Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the  implementation of the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;  ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are  allocated directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting  skills;  ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and  strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team,  the Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes  providing technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership  skills;   ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and  families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the  assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school  environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of  events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.;  ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational  accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and  support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;   ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report,  Quality Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;  ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise  parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their  right to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section  1118 and other applicable sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);  ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the  morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of  the Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions;  ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;   ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations  and workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           67            The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement            ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;  ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the  school year;  ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent- Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee;  ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;  ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;  ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;  ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of  their children’s progress;  ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed  about school activities and student progress;  ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a  format, and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

We use the DRA as a universal screener (Performance Series) for reading. This provides reading lexile levels for our students.  The teachers can then modify texts and provide readings that are within the reading range for each student. Students scoring  in lowest 20th percentile on the universal screening, receive Tier III reading intervention on the classroom level. This is a  phonics based program called Lexia.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           72         Teachers receive training in administering the universal screener and facilitating the Tier III intervention.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Due to the fact that we do not have a subgroup of ELLs, teachers look at the individual ELL students and chart their  progress.  We also use benchmark exams provided by the city.        4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Teachers have one data administration period a week.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Paste response to question here:        6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].    Across the board, our students score lowest in the writing subsection of the NYSESLAT. With the exception of two students,  reading is the second lowest category.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   There is a standing ELL meeting every Tuesday with the principal, the coach, and the ENL teacher to review data and make  adjustments.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   All of our ELL students on a grade, both transitional and current, are grouped in the same class where possible. This  allows for the ENL teacher to provide more integrated interventions. The students are pulled out for stand alone ENL  up to 4 periods a week.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Paste response to questions here:      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Paste response to questions here:         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              By grouping the students together in the same class, students receive the majority of their mandated integrated ENL  services.          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           73      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      Our school uses Expeditionary Learning in our Humanities classes. During integrated ENL the ENL teacher pushes in  classrooms and works with small groups of ELLs using the curricular materials provided by the city. Students receive native  language support through the use of google translate, native language versions of class novels (when available), and native  language versions of the CMP3 Math curriculum, when available.  During the standalone periods the teacher is focused primarily in teaching code based as well as meaning making strategies  using the CCLS Language, Speaking and Listening Standards. There is also a focus on mini writing projects by using mentor texts  from content area to unpack the text by focusing in on the language of the text. i.e.: problem solution, cause and effect,  argument, sequential writing) Additionally, there are periods dedicated to guided reading allowing for scaffolds of instruction  are used to reinforce reading skills. I.e.: main idea, drawing conclusion, inferencing.  The ENL teacher has access to all curriculum maps and unit maps for the school. During ENL classes, she is able to frontload  the necessary vocabulary for students' upcoming units in humanities, math, and science.            4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      Paste response to question here:        5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a.     SIFE - The primary focus for SIFE students is to develop the student’s speaking and listening skills. In both standalone and  integrated ENL periods, the student will primarily be responding verbally as well as being read to. If necessary, the student will  receive additional phonics support using Just Words or a similar program. Students receive extended time on all exams. State  provided dictionaries are provided for math and science when available.  b.     Newcomer - Similar to a SIFE student, the goal when working with newcomer students is to develop the student’s  speaking and listening skills. In both standalone and integrated ENL periods, the student will primarily be responding verbally  as well as being read to. Students receive extended time on all exams. State provided dictionaries are provided for math and  science when available.  c.     Developing  - Students who are developing will be asked to respond in writing more often and will get less auditory  support when reading. They may use an ereader that incorporates a dictionary or a text to speech function, but the majority of  the demands of reading will be on the student. Students receive extended time on all exams. State provided dictionaries are  provided for math and science when available.  d.     Long Term - Long term ELLs will receive few scaffolds to support reading with the exception of previewing vocabulary and  building background knowledge. Students will continue to receive scaffolds and support for their writing.. Students receive  extended time on all exams. State provided dictionaries are provided for math and science when available.  e.     Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status- Former ELLS will receive 90 minutes of integrated support a week.  This will be an opportunity to review their work with their teacher. This is also an opportunity to develop more domain specific  vocabulary to be used in writing and speaking. Students receive extended time on all exams. State provided dictionaries are  provided for math and science when available.          6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           74      The classroom paras are being trained in Wilson Just Words which can be used with ELL-SWDs to accelerate their language  acquisition. Additionally, the Expeditionary Learning curriculum, grade level appropriate, has modifications built in for both ELL  and SWD classrooms. These include scaffolds, multiple means of representation, and direct vocabulary instruction.   Both Go Math and Expedionary Learning focus on vocabulary acquisition. Using these programs, teachers can fornt load  necessary vocabulary for their units. Additionally, teachers reserve three periods a week for Tier II interventions within their  classrooms. This is time for teachers to work on students' explicit understanding of classroom texts or math fluency.  Finally, all SWD receive intervention periods each week using an online platform that adjusts to the students' levels.  In order to ensure that SWD ELLs are properly serviced, the IEP coordinator, Ms. Clinton, reviews all IEPs at the beginning of  each school year. Additionally, during all IEP meetings, a translator is made available so that the meeting can be conducted in  the parents' preferred language. Finally, all tri-annual reviews are conducted in the student's native language.        7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Our ELL SWD  are able to remain with his class for the majority of their periods and receive only standalone ENL class. They are  also programmed to be in class with their non SWD peers during physical education, art classes, and lunch.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Currently, our targeted intervention programs include: ALEKS for math, Wilson Reading for ELA, math fluency guided practice,  and reading fluency guided reading in all classrooms. Students are offered these supports during their core content classes.  Science targeted intervention is aligned with the ELA intervention. Our social studies classes are rolled into our ELA classes.   When available, translated versions or native language versions of intervention are used. For example, the performance series  is available in Spanish for math.     The data from last year's exams show growth in ELA over previous years.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      We are planning on adding Wilson Reading or Lexia for students who are SIFE or newcomers lacking phonemic awareness.  Students who enroll who show less than 85% accuracy on the phonemic awareness screener will receive Wilson Reading  intervention.          10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We are not discontinuing any services.       11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELL students are integrated into all curricular activities. Students participate in all core and non-required courses. They also  have the same choices of electives as all students: art, music, theater, or dance.  All of our ELL students are afforded equal opportunity to all school programs. ELLs are invited to participate in any after school  program. Sports and Arts provides after school programs which are available to all students on the campus. Our teachers also  run after school programs that are open to all students. Teachers are encouraged to reach out to their ELL students to  participate in their after school clubs.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  We use Google translate to aid in the translation of test materials. Every classroom is equipped with a smartboard allowing for  visual interpretations of new vocabulary words and content. When available, native language dictionaries are made available       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           75         to students.  Also, native language versions of classroom texts such as class novels, are used when available. We currently do  not have numbers to represent any one subgroup.      We use Expeditionary Learning in our humanities classrooms, FOSS kits in our science classrooms, and Go Math for math. All  curriculum and materials are grade level for all of our students.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   We use Google translate when necessary to translate instructions or materials for students in ENL classes.        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    ELL students follow the same curriculum as their grade level in each subject. Standalone ENL classes are linked thematically to  the work in students’ Humanities classes. This allows for the subject matter to remain grade appropriate.         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    We use Google translate to aid in the translation of test materials. Every classroom is equipped with a smartboard allowing for  visual interpretations of new vocabulary words and content. When available, native language dictionaries are made available  to students.  Also, native language versions of classroom texts such as class novels, are used when available. We currently do  not have numbers to represent any one subgroup.      We use Expeditionary Learning in our humanities classrooms, FOSS kits in our science classrooms, and Go Math  for math. All  curriculum and materials are grade level for all of our students.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Spanish:          18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Paste response to question here:        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  ELL personnel (including teachers, personnel, and APs) in the school are given a list of available PD opportunities offered  through the district, city, and Borough Field support office. Additionally, the school secretary and ELL coordinator participated  in the start of year webinar about intake, enrollment, and programming .  Additionally, Monday PD sessions focus on a variety of topics including Language Acquisition. At least 15% of professional  development time is devoted to ELLs. The focus is as follows:       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           76           Marking Period 1- Understanding the unique needs of ELL students  Marking Period 2- Management needs and planning for ELL students  Marking Period 3- Guiding students to know their own data  Marking Period 4- Unit planning for next year with ELLs in mind     Both ELL teachers work with the literacy coach on a weekly basis to unpack the Common Core Learning Standards. These  activities include reviewing task alignment activities, lesson plan reviews, and standard unpacking exercises. Additionally, both  educators have opportunities to go to outside professional development offered by the city, district, or borough field support  offices.        2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.    Department meetings each week are professional development. 15% of this time will be used for ELL-specific professional  development. Meeting agendas, staff sign ins, and all presentation materials are kept by the school's instructional coaches.  These professional development sessions focus on vocabulary acquisition, opportunities to use modeling, lesson planning, and  small group instruction.        Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   We reserve the parent engagement time on Tuesdays from 2:40-3:25 for the ENL teacher  to contact parents of ELL students to  discuss results on recent exams, progress in courses, and areas of concern.  Translation services that cannot be provided in  house are provided through translation services.       2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  Currently our parental involvement for ELL parents is lower than our non ELL parents. This year we are forming a committee to  increase parental engagement across the board by creating more opportunities for parents to be in the building. This  committee will take into account the specific needs of our ELL parents when planning events. The parent coordinator is  involved in this committee. The Parent Coordinator ensures that all outreach is translated before notices are sent home.              Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Tammy Holloway, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.            2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           79                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:                                                                                   School DBN:     Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      During enrollment, trained staff members met with families to determine students' home languages. The process  is formalized through the HLIS survey which is given to the family in their native languages and or in English. On  the HLIS, families indicated which language the student speaks at home. After collecting all data from the HLIS,  the ELL Coordinator conducts an informal interview with the famliy in English or in their native language if  necessary. If it is determined that the student speaks another language or little to no English, he or she is  administered the NYSESTIL by the ENL teacher, Lily Song which is a formal initial assessment that establishes a  student's English proficiency level within 10 days of enrollment. The student's performance on the test will       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           81      determine if the student needs ENL services. Spanish speaking students are administered the Spanish LAB within  10 days enrollment.   By reviewing the Home Language Identification Survey, by meeting with classroom teachers and parents, using  information provided by ATS reports and the Student Emergency Contact Cards, MS 355 is able to assess the  school's written translation and oral interpretation needs. According to these assessments, it is evident that  translators and interpreters are necessary to accommodate the needs of Haitian Creole, Spanish, French,  Slovak, and Punjabi.          2.
