The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7     In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           8       NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           10      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   MISSION   Section 4: SCEP Overview      It is the mission of P.S. 31 to ensure that all students receive a quality well-rounded education that will serve as a solid  foundation for future success. We will provide tools to enable our students to perform problems, think creatively,  plan, meet high standards, and be technologically literate. This enormous task cannot be accomplished alone. It will  take a team, including all staff members of P.S. 31, parents, the Department of Education staff and the community to  help students build skills, self-esteem and gain appreciation for all people. Our students will be tomorrow's leaders!   VISION   The vision at PS 31 is that:    ● Together with families and strong academic programs, we will ensure children are engaged, nurtured, and  supported with the tools needed to develop into independent learners and creative problem-solvers.   ● All students will develop and maintain a positive self-concept which will lead them to have a life filled with values  and purpose.    ● All student, staff, parents and community will gain confidence and respect for self and have a mutual respect and  regard for all.    ● All students, staff, parents and the community will become partners in learning                              2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    SCHOOL CHARACTERISTICS   P.S. 31, the William T. Davis School is located in the New Brighton section of Staten Island. P.S. 31 is an elementary  school with 385 students from pre-kindergarten through grade 5.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           11      Our school motto is “Prepare Each Day to Live Your Dreams”. Building on this theme,     Students are recognized on a monthly basis for displaying academic and character traits such as responsibility,  respect, caring, fairness, honesty and citizenship. The student names are displayed on a bulletin board near the main  office.     Effective communication and engagement with parents/guardians is a critical goal. To achieve this, the school has  an open door policy for parents to come in and meet with our parent coordinator. Monthly progress reports are sent  home with students for parents to review. Teachers engage parents in discussions about children and how they can  improve their performance academically and socially during the Tuesday parent engagement block as well as during  the school day.     All classes read and respond to a common book each month. Books are selected to support character and social  emotional development and instill a growth mindset.   Every classroom has a Smart Board and laptop computers. Use of technology will help students acquire skills needed  to best prepare them for college and career.    PS 31 has established relationships with community organizations. The Sundog Theatre Company has brought art,  drama, music and movement to the students. Universal Temple of the Arts also provides art-based programming.  Power My Learning supports our school by conducting workshops and supplying laptops to students in grades Pre-K  to 5. In addition, they provide coaching support to begin station teaching and blended learning in the second and  third grade classes. The school works with the Staten Island Community Partnership to support the "Dads Take Your  Children To School Day" program. We work with outside organizations such as The Fresh Air Fund and the Good Grief  program to bring information and expedite enrollment for interested families.     School trips are an essential part of the curriculum. Classes regularly travel to museums, parks and theaters to  increase their knowledge of the content areas, the arts and their community.      Students and parents are welcomed each morning by school staff upon arrival. Parents and students are welcome  to address questions and concerns each morning in this informal setting.     Most students can identify at least one person they believe they can turn to if they need support.    STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS   PS 31 has formed a partnership with the College of Staten Island (CSI) education department. One section of their  reading class is taught by the CSI professor at PS 31. The students then assess, intervene and re-assess selected  students under the supervision of the professor. Last year, almost 40 second grade students were paired with the CSI  students for weekly tutoring. The goal is to raise the reading performance of students who are approaching the  Common Core ELA learning standards.      In 2018-2019, PS 31 will work with Power My Learning to improve teaching and learning in the first, second and third  grades with a particular emphasis on station learning and the use of technology. This will continue the work they  began with students in the 2017-2018 school year. In addition, they will provide professional development sessions  for teachers and hold workshops for families to increase parent engagement.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           12         PS 31 is continuing its work with Readworks. Readworks is providing and supporting the Article-A-Day program with  resources for teachers and students along with high quality professional development to meet the Reading for  Information standards. The primary emphasis is to improve reading comprehension by reading daily, building  background knowledge and learning academic vocabulary through text.    We are continuing participation in Rising New York Road Runners, NYRR's youth program and events platform, is built  to develop movement skills in children through a mix of running and fitness activities. The program is designed to help  kids build their confidence, their motivation, and their desire to be physically active for life. Rising New York Road  Runners' curriculum is based on the latest athletic research, on the concepts of physical literacy and long-term athlete  development.       An Extended School Day Violence Prevention Grant is providing an after school program with several components  including The Virtual Y after school program for grades 1-5, Read Alliance for grades K-2 and computer coding for  grades 2 and 3. This program extends instructional time for the participating students and provides enrichment,  especially in technology and the arts. The goal is to provide additional instructional supports and to increase  motivation for students to attend school.      In addition we will continue to work with Boy Scouts of America by providing a meeting place for fourth and fifth  graders to join the Cub Scouts.    NYU Lutheran provides a dental program at PS 31 so that students can have routine dental work performed during  the school day which positively impacts student attendance.        3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   More specific data with respect to student performance is contained in the Needs Analysis sections that follow.

Many students  have social and emotional needs that affect their academic performance.We have distinct student populations with  specific needs: our English Language Learners (ELLs) and our population of Students with Disabilities (SWDs). Our  English Language Learners gain proficiency in oral language (speaking and listening) before they gain proficiency in  written language (reading and writing). The greatest instructional need for English Language Learners is support with  academic reading and academic writing skills. We have a large population of Students with Disabilities. The  instructional needs of this group is as varied as the students themselves. However, two common threads are the need  to increase proficiency in academic reading and academic writing AND the need to increase proficiency in math. For  students who are ELL-SWDs, the greatest instructional need is an increase in academic vocabulary. These students  tend to be vocabulary-deprived, which then has an adverse effect on their academic progress.   In 2016-2017, the school added a Horizon Kindergarten class. This class is an 8:1:1 class for selected students with  autism. A first grade class was added in 2017-2018. A second grade class was added in 2018 - 2019. This program  requires professional development for teachers and paraprofessionals, time for teachers to observe students for  assessment and planning and team time for teachers and related service providers to meet to define and  coordinate services.    FRAMEWORK FOR GREAT SCHOOLS   In 2016-2017, the school added a Horizon Kindergarten class. This class is an 8:1:1 class for selected students with  autism. A first grade class was being added in 2017-2018. A second grade class will be added in 2018 - 2019. This  program requires professional development for teachers and paraprofessionals, time for teachers to observe  students for assessment and planning and team time for teachers and related service providers to meet to define  and coordinate services.       Based on the School Quality Guide, the school performed above the district and citywide average with respect to  TRUST. Informal surveys conducted by the School Leadership Team confirm that most respondents are satisfied with  school culture and learning environment.       PS 31 has also established a SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENT where most students are known by administrators and  other school staff in addition to their teachers and can identify a staff member they can reach out to when they need  assistance.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   FOCUS TO IMPROVE STUDENT PERFORMANCE      Based on classroom observations and analysis of student work, there is a need for teachers to learn the Common Core  Learning Standards (CCLS) in more depth to plan and deliver lessons that are standards based with multiple access  points to engage all students in rigorous instruction. In addition, changes in ongoing assessment and instruction are  needed to improve student performance as measured by NYS exams       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           14      THEREFORE,    the key area of focus for this year is to promote effective student engagement through rigorous instruction that is  aligned to the standards. Planning for instruction will be driven by collaborative practices. Students will become  assessment capable learners. Our goal will be to continue building strong family ties and trust in our community, as  evidenced by the Framework for Great Schools report.      Goals:     Proficiency in Early Childhood Literacy (Rigorous Instruction)    Development of FBA/BIPS (Supportive Environment)    Establishing and maintaining Impact Teams (Collaborative Teaching)    PD plan to support development of learning intentions and success criteria and use of formative assessment   data to drive instruction (Effective Leadership)  Strengthening Parent and Family Engagement (Strong Family and Community Ties)      The element of the Framework that PS31 made the most progress is Trust. According to the 2017-2018 School Quality  Guide the survey score in the element of Trust was + .51.      Our instructional focus for 2018-2019 is, “IF teachers use data to collaboratively plan standard based ELA lessons that  include explicit instruction (EI) paired with specially designed instruction (SDI) that meet the needs of individual  students, THEN student engagement will increase and students will demonstrate progress toward meeting ELA grade  level standards as evidenced by progress monitoring through the iReady program, TCRWP running records and  program/teacher made assessments both formative and summative.                   2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           15      School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 31R031   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   388   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   # Special Classes (ELA)  # Special Classes (Math)   # Visual Arts  # Foreign Language   % Title I Population  % Free Lunch  % Limited English Proficient   56  58   18     % American Indian or Alaska Native  % Hispanic or Latino  % White   # SETSS (ELA)  # SETSS (Math)  Types and Number of Special Classes (2018-19)  # Music  # Drama  # CTE  # Dance   14  10   18  18   # Integrated Collaborative Teaching (ELA)  # Integrated Collaborative Teaching (Math)   School Composition (2017-18)   90.0%  % Attendance Rate  89.4%  % Reduced Lunch  6.2%   % Students with Disabilities   Racial/Ethnic Origin (2017-18)   % Black or African American   1.0%  43.3%  % Asian or Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander  5.7%   % Multi-Racial   Personnel (2015-16)   Years Principal Assigned to School (2018-19)  % of Teachers with No Valid Teaching Certificate  % Teaching with Fewer Than 3 Years of Experience   1.21  0%  0%   # of Assistant Principals (2016-17)  % Teaching Out of Certification  Average Teacher Absences (2014-15)   Student Performance for Elementary and Middle Schools (2017-18)   ELA Performance at levels 3 & 4   18.2%  Mathematics Performance at levels 3 & 4   Science Performance at levels 3 & 4 (4th Grade) (2016-17)   70%   Science Performance at levels 3 & 4 (8th Grade) (2016- 17)   Student Performance for High Schools (2016-17)   ELA Performance at levels 3 & 4  Global History Performance at levels 3 & 4  4 Year Graduation Rate   Regents Diploma w/ Advanced Designation   N/A  N/A  N/A   N/A   Mathematics Performance at levels 3 & 4  US History Performance at Levels 3 & 4  6 Year Graduation Rate (2011 Cohort)  % ELA/Math Aspirational Performance Measures  (2015-16)   Reward  In Good Standing  Focus District   Priority School   Overall NYSED Accountability Status (2018-19)   No  No  Yes   Recognition  Local Assistance Plan  Focus School Identified by a Focus District   No   Focus Subgroups   -

We will continue with RTI  Orton-Gillingham interventions in K-2 to build strong foundational skills.    iReady BOY diagnostic data also revealed that students in grades K, 1, ,2 and 3 lacked phonics skills. K- 60% below; Grade  1 – 90 % below; Grade 2 – 97% below and Grade 3- 89% below level. The data includes SWD and ENL students.   67% of the SWD are two or more grade below performance level.   81% of the ENLs are two or more grades below performance level.   Data from iReady focusing on standards RI.1 , RI.4 and RL.1 and RL.4 revealed:   RI/RL 4 : 90% of the students in grades 1 -5 are below grade level.   RI.1: 89% of the students in grades 1-5 are below grade level.   RL.1: 87% of the students in grades 1-5 are below grade level.      iReady will provide individualized instructional learning paths to address varied needs of students. In addition we will  work with the special education specialist to meet the needs of SWDs and ENLs.      Data from New York State ELA and Math testing was analyzed in determining school needs.

(Quality Review  was not conducted in 2017-2018.) The school needs to align instruction with curriculum, provide rigorous instruction  with emphasis on higher order skills and provide students with actionable feedback from assessments consistently in all  classes.       Based on classroom observations and analysis of student work, there is a need for teachers to learn the Common Core  Learning Standards (CCLS) in more depth to plan and deliver lessons that are standards based with multiple access  points to engage all students in rigorous instruction.    Strengths   School is meeting target in student progress. (School Quality Guide)    Needs   In February 2016, the New York State Education (NYSED) identified our school, P. S. 31R, as a Focus School. This  continues for the 2017-18 school year based on the performance of one or more of our school's subgroups in ELA and  Math. A review of the testing data indicates that changes in ongoing assessment and instruction are needed to improve  student performance as measured by the NYS exams.

Needs Assessment      In 2017-2018 school year, there were 234 incidents reported in the Online Occurrence Report System (OORS). Of these,  191 were level 3 or higher.(OORS)      Attendance rate was 87.9% with 36.25% of students classified as chronically absent for the 2017-2018 school year.           2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           28      On the 2016-2017 School Quality Guide, PS 31 is approaching the target with a rating of 2.76 for supportive  environment.       Strengths as noted in the Quality Review are that most students are known by name to school administrators and other  staff. Most students can identify a staff member they are comfortable enough with to discuss concerns.      PS 31 needs to more effectively address the social-emotional needs of students that result in disruptive behavior in the  classroom and common areas and that may also result in excessive absences.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  The BEDS survey is used each year to identify teachers who need additional certification. Currently 100% of the staff is  highly qualified as defined by Every Student Succeeds Act(ESSA) . If a teacher did need additional certification, teacher  would be supported with ongoing professional development to meet certification needs.    In the event of a pedagogical vacancy, strenuous efforts are made to hire a HQT.    Teachers are recruited using the open market and ATR pool when appropriate. Prospective teachers are interviewed  by a team consisting of school administrators and teacher leaders. New teachers are supported through the formal  mentoring process and through involvement with colleagues on teacher teams.    All teachers are supported through high quality professional development delivered by the school instructional  leaders, by district and central personnel, publishers of curriculum materials and other vendors. Teachers also  participate in professional development activities during the dedicated time on Monday with most teachers involved  in Professional Learning Communities based on self- identified learning goals. A teacher resource room is maintained  that includes an extensive professional library, curriculum materials, sample lessons, classroom charts, etc.    Retention strategies include supporting the teachers in developing their effectiveness using the research based  Danielson Framework. Teachers develop individual professional goals and school administrators provide support and  assistance as needed. Teachers are observed formally and informally using the Danielson rubric and provided with  feedback and discussion. Assistance to improve effectiveness may include lesson modeling, low inference observation  and feedback, inter visitations, professional development workshops and materials.   All teachers are part of a grade level team with meetings facilitated by an instructional leader. Teachers are assigned  to grades taking into account their preferences, experience and professional capacity for the assignment. Teacher  teams identify instructional materials, strategies, and curriculum plans for their grade and school administrators  facilitate the acquisition of materials and supplies.    Teachers are provided with time to meet the planning and instructional requirements of their assignment. The weekly  schedule includes at least 1 common planning period for each grade in addition to the time provided on Monday and       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           58      Tuesday after school to provide the additional time and support needed to develop effective Common Core Learning  Standards-based instruction to meet the needs of all students.    If a vacancy occurred and was filled by a teacher who was not highly qualified, Title 1 funding may be used to assist  the teacher in meeting requirements        2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the strategies and activities for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, staff, and  paraprofessionals that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   PS 31 has identified instructional leaders on each grade who can model lessons, provide resources and engage in  discussion with other teachers on grade, Teachers are encouraged to visit other classrooms to observe best practices  and request low inference observations and feedback from peers. Teachers are surveyed to identify professional  development needs and coordinate the delivery of professional development based on those needs.   Teachers and paraprofessionals form Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) based on self-identified needs. PLC's  based on book study identify action plans to improve teaching practice and assess impact of change. As indicated  above, teachers also participate in teacher team meetings and identify the professional development they need to  enable all students to meet the CCLS.    Teachers, principal and assistant principal attend citywide and district sponsored training as well as training offered by  representatives of CCLS based curriculum. Information is turn keyed to effected staff.   School administrators conduct formal and informal observations and provide feedback to teachers including  opportunities for professional development with a specific focus to address identified needs.   All staff members are encouraged to reflect on their practice and identify personal professional development goals.  School administrators and staff developer assist in developing personal development plans.    School maintains a professional resource center with literature, models, samples of curriculum delivery methods to  enhance teaching practice.   80 minutes of professional development time on Monday afternoon is used for book clubs, turnkey training, team  meetings and other professional development activities. 35 minutes after school on Tuesdays is used for teacher team  meetings.

TA Coordination with the Regular Program   Describe the planning, coordination and support of the TA program with the regular educational program (i.e.,  providing ELT, accelerated, high-quality curriculum, including applied learning; and minimize removing children from  the regular classroom during regular school day).       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           59      N/A        Part 4: SWP Schools Only   4a. Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/information,  early intervention services, etc.).  Preschool students who attend PS 31 are provided with a curriculum aligned with the Common Core Learning  Standards. The Pre-K teacher attends Kindergarten teacher team meetings and other curriculum professional  development to facilitate transition. Pre-K parents from this school and other Pre-K programs are invited to tour  school and observe the Kindergarten program with their children. Pre-K teacher works with Kindergarten teachers  each spring to share records and discuss individual students as part of the articulation process. Pre-K students visit  Kindergarten classes during May and June to assist in transition.         4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     School administrators, and testing coordinator research assessments and present choices to teacher teams. Teachers  participate in grade level teams to discuss appropriate assessment measures for the students in their grade.  Instructional lead of each team is a member of a vertical planning team that reviews assessments to ensure  consistency across the grades. Professional development is provided by administrators, test coordinator, by the  Department of Education periodic assessment team and by assessment publishers. Teachers who attend professional  development sessions are expected to turnkey the information to the appropriate staff. Teachers meet weekly in their  teacher teams to analyze student data and use that data to inform their instructional practices.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           61        Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           62      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. William T Davis School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of  the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      William T Davis School will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           63      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent-Teacher Association, as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on  the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input. To increase  and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  -Teacher Association and Title I Parent Committee.

The data indicates a need for intensive  instruction in reading and writing to attain English proficiency. This academic intervention must  also include reading and writing in the content areas including science, social studies and math in  using ESL methodologies to meet the Common Core Learning Standards.  The Title 3 after  school program is designed to develop skills in listening, speaking, reading and writing in the  English language. The goals for the program are to   •     Attain English Language Proficiency  •     Meet or exceed New York State and City expectations and standards  •     Develop these skills in content areas including math, social studies and science.  Subgroups include general education and special education students. Grade levels include First  through Fifth grade. In addition to all ELLs, the program will be offered as a transitional service  to former ELLs.  Schedules and Durations:  The program consists of 15  two hour sessions offered after school, two days a week from 2:35- 4:35.  Grades 1-5 will attend  on Wednesday and Thursday  beginning February 2018  and  ending June2018    2018.     Language of Instruction:  The only program currently in our school is a free standing ENL program. Therefore, we use  English as the language of instruction.  Number and type of certified teachers:  One  certified ENL teacher(content teacher if needed) will teach the program. The assistant  principal will serve as supervisor. In addition, the assistant principal will provide instructional  support during the program.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           71         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   Types of materials:  Materials include content vocabulary  and Informational texts including trade books from the  content areas of science and social studies. Internet programs,National Geographic and  Readworks.org will be used to support reading and writing in all areas. The Making Meaning  program will also be used to provide additional instruction in reading, writing, listening and  speaking. The Common Core Learning Standards in reading, writing, speaking and listening will  be addressed on each grade level specifically with respect to informational reading and writing.  As part of our "cultural studies approach" to literature,students engage in a unit of study of non- fiction texts from a variety of cultures and historical periods.  The unit includes a  study of  the  literature with an integration of relevant art, music and dance. Title 3 funds will be used to obtain  a bus to attend a performance  that aligns with the curriculum. Tickets for a show will be  purchased using other funds. Following the trip, students will use graphic organizers to record  their information..  This also aligns  to the ELA common core learning standards in responding  to literature.    Students are asked to demonstrate understanding of fictional stories by making connection to  themselves. One text used for this instruction is Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, Very Bad  Day. After reading the book and making connection verbally and in writing, a  trip to attend a  dramatic presentation of "Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, Very Bad Day" at the St. George  Theatre is planned. Students will be asked to compare the experience of reading the book ELA  common core learning standards for responding to fiction, speaking and listening as well as the  Blueprint for the Arts in drama. Title 3 funds will be used to obtain a bus to attend the  performance. Tickets for the play will be purchased using other funds.   To increase parent engagement, parents of ELL students are also invited to attend these trips.   Program notification in parents preferred language (based on indicator on home language  identification survey)will be sent home to parents/guardians.  An English letter will be attached  as well.  The ENL coordinator will maintain  copies of parent letters as well as daily attendance  sheets. Parents/Guardians will sign out upon dismissal.

Instruction must be scaffold and differentiated to provide access to the curriculum for the ELL  students. All teachers are encouraged to attend professional development workshops provided by  the Department of Education, UFT, etc.   In addition, the certified ENL teacher who is also the Title 3 program teacher attends  professional development workshops and meetings offered by the network instructional  specialists and other Department of Education staff. Topics for this professional development  include acquisition of English language skills, Universal Design for Learning, differentiation of  instruction and data collection and analysis.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           72         Part C: Professional Development   The ESL teacher provides rigorous professional development during after school workshops to  teachers of ELL students. The professional development curriculum includes the following  topics: explanation of the mandates for ELL instruction, orientation process for parents and  students, assessments including NYSITELL and NYSESLAT, stages of second language  acquisition, ESL standards, ESL instructional methodologies, and learning styles of ELL  students. The curriculum is designed to enable all teachers of ELL students to deliver high  quality instruction to the limited English proficient students.   The ENL teacher provides four 90 minute workshops during the professional development  extended day for groups of certified common branch and special education teachers to cover the  above curriculum. In addition, each teacher may meet with the ESL teacher during professional  development periods to analyze the design of individual lessons to incorporate ESL  methodologies and to ensure access to the curriculum for the ELLs.  The ESL teacher will also  provide professional development in the analysis of performance data to individualize teaching  and learning approaches.. Since this professional development will be performed during the  extended day, Title 3 funds will not be used for it.   Ongoing professional development is also available during the school day. Common branch and  special education teachers are encouraged to observe ELL lessons conducted by the ESL teacher  during the pull out portion of instruction. The ESL teacher is also available to model lessons in  the classroom.  All teachers receive ongoing professional development in the planning and delivery of literacy  and math lessons for all students including ELLs from other teachers and network staff.   Professional development will be conducted  monthly on specific  designated Monday Afternoon  Professional development time. Title 3 funds will  not be used for this pd.  The ENL coordinator  will create an agenda that will address the ELL Identification Process, ELL Policy as well as  various ELL strategies for classroom use. Attendance sheets will be generated and teachers will  sign in. Teachers will be given certificates for hours completed. If available, an ENL special  presenter  may be invited to present a lesson for pd.         Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact  higher achievement for ELLs.

All  parents are encouraged to attend and participate in PTA, school safety and school leadership  team (SLT) meetings. Participation is encouraged through the use of translation and  interpretation services in Spanish, the most common language for the ELLs. Each meeting is  held once per month and each lasts about one hour.  SLT Walkthroughs are held several times  per year during which parents may visit several classrooms accompanied by instructional staff to       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           73         Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    observe and discuss instruction. This empowers the parents to become engaged with the  curriculum, school staff and community.  Single topic workshops are facilitated by the parent coordinator. Ell parents are invited to PTA  monthly meetings which take place on Friday mornings. Meetings often last for (1) hour and  continue for the remainder of the school year.These topics include core curriculum expectations,  literacy, conducting a read aloud, New York State testing, planning for the science fair, and other  topics of interest identified by the parents. Translation and interpretation in Spanish are provided  at these events by parent volunteers. The school has partnered with Literacy Inc to provide  parents  with the training to serve in the school as reading volunteers. Volunteers may choose to  read to students in English and Spanish and Spanish language fiction and non-fiction books are  provided.  Classroom teachers have scheduled grade appropriate homework help sessions for all parents and  interpretation services are provided. In addition,copies of math program materials are provided to  parents in Spanish so they can assist their children at home.  Parents of ELL students new to the school are invited to tour the school and receive information  about school programs and activities. Tours are facilitated by the parent coordinator. Parents are  welcome to visit the classroom and observe instruction. Parents of ELL students are encouraged  to attend class trips to share the cultural and community experiences with their child.   Report cards are provided to parents in their native language when available. Monthly progress  reports also keep parents informed of their child’s progress and these are available in English and  Spanish.   Parents are notified of activities through bi-monthly school newsletters, letters and notices that  are backpacked home and word of mouth by volunteers who translate information during  morning arrival and afternoon dismissal.   Translation and interpretation during the school day is provided by school staff whenever  possible. Parent volunteers assist as needed. Services of the NYC Department of Education  Translation and Interpretation Unit are used to communicate with non-English speaking parents  when translator is not available at the school.  Parents are advised of the availability of  translation services by means of signs in school lobby, card at safety agent's desk and on school  letters.    In April, the ENL teacher will provide ( 1) 45 minute parent workshop  to provide information  on the upcoming NYSESLAT examination. Parent brochures will be given out in requested  language as well as various test taking strategies.   Our ELL parents were invited to tour the school prior to the start of the school year.  On August  31, 2018, parents/guardians were provided a tour of  the school with our Principal and Parent  Coordinator.  On November 5, 2018, parents are invited to attend a Title 1  meeting.                2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           74   Part E: Budget   FOR SCHOOLS NOT CONCEPTUALLY CONSOLIDATED ONLY.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Early literacy skills are assessed using the TCRWP four times per year.  In June, 2018, 96% of  ELLs scored at level 1 or 2 based  on the June benchmarks for their grade. 96% of students remained at their initial benchmark level 4% moved one benchmark  level up. From September to June 8% did not improve or entered late in the school year and not enough data was collected,  32% of the students increased by one reading level, 36% increased by 2 levels, 24 %increased by 3 levels or more independent  reading levels.  Instruction was tailored in part based on the characteristics of these levels and the error analysis of the running  records. For instance, students reading at Level A and B need to solidify letter-sound relationships, word by word matching of  the spoken to written word and decoding basic words. Students at level G and H need more complex word solving strategies       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           77      and are beginning to encounter challenging vocabulary.        2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Analysis of reading record miscues and error patterns indicates that students show progress in grade level phonics skills.  However, the lack of fluency when reading impacts comprehension.  Supplemental curriculum material for the Core  Knowledge program is used to provide additional instruction to ELL students. Comprehension is also impacted by the need to  develop appropriate  vocabulary and background information. Guided reading instruction to develop understanding of text structures and strategies  to identify word meanings are indicated to improve comprehension.  Repeated readings and accessing audio recordings of  books to improve fluency are also indicated. Development of written expression skills including spelling are also included in  the instructional plan for ELL students.   The current school-wide plan of reading an article each day and creating a written  response is further differentiated for ELL students to include an emphasis on vocabulary, especially tier 2 words that will be  encountered in academic reading.       3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We do not have a sufficient number of ELL students to form a subgroup for AYP purposes. We evaluate the success of our  program by evaluating the progress of individual students on standardized measures such as the NYS ELA , Math and NYSESLAT  exams and informal measures such as the TCRWP and unit assessments in the content areas. Individual data is analyzed to  determine trends. Instructional decisions are based on this data.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    These instructional decisions include increased emphasis on reading and writing strategies and techniques including  the development and use of content area vocabulary to achieve increased progress towards English language acquisition.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   All students including ELLs are provided with "increasingly intensive, targeted instruction designed to meet their needs" (RTI  Guide) The Initial data is obtained during the screening process. The first part of this is the HLIS as this provides the teacher  with information about the students linguistic background. The formal assessment (NYSITELL) provides additional data on the  students English acquisition level. All students are screened for performance on literacy and math strands. This screening can  identify if the student should receive targeted support in the academic area in coordination with language support services.  Students begin with Tier 1 instruction. The instructional core needs to be adapted so that curriculum is accessible for the ELL  student. If the student is not showing sufficient progress on the skills and competencies, a more intensive targeted  intervention is provided. Progress monitoring is continued to assess how a student is responding to the instruction. The  student progress must be compared to that of their peers. Teachers can then use data to determine when to adjust instruction  for all ELLs or for specific students. Student progress can be reviewed by the school RTI team to review interventions for  appropriateness to the curriculum and the cultural and linguistic background of the students. The ENL teacher and the  classroom teacher work collaboratively to differentiate lessons, define initial interventions and assessment methods. If a  student demonstrates persistent difficulties after receiving intensive interventions over a period of time, we will request an  evaluation to determine if a student requires special education students.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Of the 28 students who were tested using NYSESLAT or NYSITELL, 21% were Entering, 4% were Emerging, 18% were  Transitioning, 36% were Expanding and 21% were Commanding. 2017-2018 data not yet available.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           78         Test data is shared with and reviewed by certified ENL teachers and data specialist. ENL teachers work with classroom teachers  to disseminate information.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   The school has a free standing ENL program. A typical schedule for students at the beginning/entering level of  proficiency as well as the low intermediate/emerging level of proficiency involves 4 integrated periods of not less than  45 minutes each per week and 4 standalone periods of not less than 45 minutes each per week,   for a total of 360  minutes. A typical schedule for an intermediate/transitioning level of proficiency is two 45 minute period each week  of  standalone ENL and two 45 minutes of integrated service for a total of 45 minutes. Advanced/expanding student  receive 180 minutes of integrated instruction consisting of four 45 minute periods each  week.  Proficient/commanding students receive 90 minutes of integrated instruction consisting of two 45 minutes per  week. The program model for standalone periods is primarily  heterogeneously grouped by grade with no more than 2  consecutive grades together.  During integrated periods, students are heterogeneously grouped and are instructed by  the ENL and content area teachers. Content area covered during the integrated periods consists of literacy, math,  science and social studies.  Content area is also incorporated into standalone instruction especially through an  emphasis on non-fiction literacy and informational texts. All instruction is provided by the certified ENL teacher.   The integrated service takes place in a classroom on the students' grade with the ENL teacher pushing in to instruct  along with the classroom teacher. The standalone service is provided by the ENL teacher in a classroom dedicated for  that purpose  (room 311).    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     not applicable   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      not applicable        2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Mandated instructional minutes are provided to all students. School administrators review student data and teacher schedules  to ensure that the program model is followed. IEPs are reviewed by school administrators and the school assessment team.  Currently students whose IEPs mandate bilingual instruction are assigned alternate placement paraprofessionals as PS 31 does  not have a transitional bilingual class. These paraprofessionals provide native language instruction and the ENL teacher  provides English language instruction.  PS 31 has two full time ENL teachers who ensure that students are served in the free standing ENL period in accordance with  the instructional minutes mandated according to the proficiency levels. Beginner and  Low Intermediate students receive 360  minutes of ENL instruction while Intermediate and Advanced students receive 180 minutes.  Proficient students (former ELLs)  receive 90 minutes of integrated service each week.  Following is a sample schedule for a beginner student receiving free standing ENL services.

Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   The ENL teacher follows the school wide common core curriculum to ensure that students receive Common Core Learning  Standards based instruction ELL methodologies are employed in the delivery of instruction. To encourage ELL students to  become self-directed learners rather than teacher-dependent learners, the ENL teacher demonstrates proficient models of  both oral and written English language. To further the infusion of content instruction, the ENL teacher uses a combination of  mini lessons, guided practice and independent practice,  collaborative learning partnerships, and  computers practice. . The  ENL classroom is visually rich including paired pictures and words to encourage acquisition of English language vocabulary. The  ENL teacher works collaboratively using a team teaching approach with the classroom teacher during integrated  periods  providing on-going assistance including the necessary English language vocabulary in the content area instruction. Both the  ENL teacher as well as the classroom teacher provides concrete experiences which will allow the language to become  comprehensible. There is flexible grouping in the ENL classroom as well as the regular class based on the academic needs of  the student as evidenced by the data obtained from various sources including NYSITELL and NYSESLAT and periodic  assessments. The ENL teacher meets with teachers on common preps, informal meetings, teacher team inquiry meetings, and  during articulation opportunities to determine the most effective way to provide content area support for ELLs. Planning  includes adapting common core based lessons for the classroom to support ELLs and planning to integrate content information  in the standalone  ENL periods as well as the inter-grated periods.  The ENL teacher creates a partnership with the classroom  teacher to enhance communication between parents and teachers.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?       Students whose native language is Spanish are initially assessed with the Spanish LAB. Additionally, Spanish proficient  paraprofessionals are available to translate assessment information for students to determine their acquisition of content area  knowledge. New York State assessments in Math and Science are obtained in translated versions so that students are assessed  in their native language whenever possible. When translated state assessments are not available, students may be provided  with a translator. Additionally, students are provided with bilingual glossaries. Home language books and materials are  maintained in the school library and the ENL classroom. Students may choose from these materials and respond to  comprehension prompts given in writing and verbally by a proficient speaking peer who shares the same home language. Their  response can then be translated so the teacher can assess literacy skills. Whenever feasible, students are paired with other  students with the same home language to give an opportunity for speaking and listening skill practice.          Students who are referred to the School Assessment Team for evaluation are evaluated by a bilingual team.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing         2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           80      d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Instruction is differentiated for ELL subgroups as follows:  a.     SIFE: Although we currently have no SIFE students, our plans for Students with Interrupted Formal Education include  intensive support in all academic content areas. Individualized goals are established based on assessment data. Small group  instruction and individualized programs using technology are employed. In addition, before and after school sessions are made  available to the student to provide additional individualized instruction.  b.     ELLs in schools less than 3 years: classroom strategies include:  *Providing a buddy that speaks the same language when possible  *Providing an English speaking buddy to demonstrate routines and procedures  *Creating opportunities for new students to participate in all school-wide activities.  *Providing visual support such as charts, word walls with picture cues, picture cards , graphs or videos  *Allowing opportunities to interact with classmates at a teacher directed center or guided reading instruction  *Using books accompanied by audio cassettes to allow the students to master English skills while using a visual aid  simultaneously.  *Using bilingual dictionaries to assist in translation where applicable.  *Providing continual praise/encouragement of the child’s success  *Specific instruction and assessment in listening and speaking  *Progress monitoring using formal and informal assessments to establish individual goals in listening, speaking, reading and  writing  *Use of technology to individualize instruction in reading, listening, speaking, math and other content areas  * After school test preparation instruction led by a certified ENL teacher  *The instructional plan for all ELLs including Students With Disabilities (SWD)are aligned with the state standards in ELA and  math.  Teachers prepare students for state exams using a standards based curriculum. Test preparation strategies and materials are  used as part of the instruction to prepare students for the testing process. Students are also provided with testing  accommodations in the classroom as well as on the state exams.  c.     ELLs receiving service for 4 to 6 years: in addition to continuing strategies from above, emphasis is placed on reading and  writing instruction. Results of assessments including NYSESLAT, ELL interim assessments, periodic assessments, NYS ELA and  Math exams are reviewed to determine zone of proximal development so that instructional goals that be accurately set.   d.     Long term ELLs require additional targeted instruction in areas where progress has not been made. Such instruction is in  addition to any ENL services and may be provided by the AIS teachers or by the classroom teacher. This additional instruction  will consist of no less than 30 minutes of small group direct explicit instruction at least 3 times per week.   e.     Former ELLs are supported for up to 2 years if needed, They may be provided with ELL test accommodations during that  time on classroom as well as state tests. These students are provided with two 45 minute periods a week  of integrated ENL  services in the content areas and may continue to participate in any before or after school programs intended for ELLs. They  may also be supported in the AIS or reading Volunteer program.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   IEPs of all ELL students are reviewed to determine the mandated services. ELLs with special needs are serviced in accordance  with their IEP. ENL services are provided when indicated on the IEP in addition to other mandated services. SESIS and ATS  reports are reviewed to determine that mandated services are initiated. When an IEP mandates bilingual instruction, an  alternate placement paraprofessional is assigned to the student to ensure bilingual support in the classroom since a bilingual  class is currently not available.  The student is also provided with ENL services based on their level. The ENL teacher, speech  teachers and classroom teachers collaborate in identifying and delivering appropriate interventions for these students. These  students are also eligible for Academic Intervention Services (AIS) that may includes additional instructional materials,  resources and instruction by AIS teachers. Reading volunteers  may also assist these students. Grade level curriculum is used  with differentiation to accommodate the needs of the ELL-SWDs including opportunities to listen to materials during teacher       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           81      read alouds, audio books and the use of technology such as MyON and readworks.org. In the classroom, students frequently  work in pairs or small groups. Students are provided with the opportunity to engage in oral discussion and reports to  strengthen speaking skills in accordance with grade level standards. Supplemental reading and writing material is used to  facilitate development of literacy skills. This includes use of Wilson reading program, Source Books,Making Meaning reading  comprehension program, Being a Writer, grammar and vocabulary workshop materials. These materials are available for all  grades. Through MyON, teachers have access to leveled books which can be matched to students based on appropriateness.  They include high interest readable texts to maintain age appropriateness for the older students.           Graphic organizers and vocabulary instruction using context and pictures from textproject.org are used as an additional  strategy to provide access to content and accelerate English language development.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  ELL students with disabilities are initially placed in the least restrictive environment following an evaluation in their native  language. ELLs are placed in a general education classroom if they receive Special Education Teacher Support Services(SETSS)  and an Integrated Co-Teaching (ICT) classroom with 85% of the students being general education and 15% being special  education. Decisions to place students in these programs are based on the level of academic support the student requires.   During standalone ENL periods, SWDs may be included with ELLs from general education classes in accordance with the group  size specified on their IEP. ELL-SWDs are included with general education students during gym, art, music periods and  lunch/recess time. Trips and other activities are planned on a grade level basis so that all students can participate equally.  Instruction is planned on a grade level basis and the additional supports that may be needed by an ELL-SWD are identified in  the planning process so that the student can continue to receive services in the least restrictive environment .      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Targeted interventions programs for ELLs in ELA, math and other content areas are offered in English as follows.  •    Orton-Gillingham  •     Explode the Code and Core Knowledge phonics (Grades K-3)  •     Being A Writer; research based writing intervention (all grades) Making Meaning; a research based reading comprehension  intervention (all grades)  •     Sadlier Oxford Vocabulary Workshop program (Grades 4-5)  •     Daily small group instruction in reading strategies provided by classroom teacher. Materials used for this reading include  books and passages from the content areas of science and social studies.  •     Daily small group instruction in math content and strategies provided by classroom teacher  •     Differentiated instruction in all content areas  •     Individualized instruction using technology such as Readworks.org, Pathblazer, or MyON  •     Center based activities such as  Conversation Cues Oral language Cards  •     Home Team Advantage Literacy Tool Kit NYSESLAT and Beyond workbooks (all grades) These interventions are offered in  English.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      ELA curriculum (Core knowledge for grades K-2 and Expeditionary Learning for grades 3-5) is reviewed on an ongoing basis to  identify areas for improvement and additional resources. For the upcoming school year new ELA programs will be used.  Programs (Reading Streets K-2 and iReady K-5) will be adapted for ELL and SWD  to allow for differentiation and use of ELL  strategies.   The Go Math curriculum is used school wide.  Units are  reviewed to include increased use of manipulatives and  multiple entry points into the curriculum.  In addition, we are integrating Teacher College Writing, a  research-based writing  curriculum into literacy instruction as NYSESLAT data shows lack of progress in this area. In addition, Explode the Code, an  Orton Gillingham based phonics program, will be added based on students needs.  A school-wide program to increase reading  comprehension is relevant for ELL students. We have incorporated Readworks.org - Article-A-Day, this includes reading daily to  build background knowledge and content vocabulary.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           82         10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We do not anticipate discontinuing any programs at this time.      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs.  Currently the school does not have after school programs. When after  school programs are offered they are open to all students. Invitations to all programs are translated in the preferred language  so that parents can understand and consent to the student's participation. Interpretation is available at parent workshops,  parent teacher conferences and PTA meetings so that parents have appropriate access to information. To ensure that ELLs  have equal access to curriculum programs during the school day, students with the same native language are grouped for  certain activities to assist each other. Also when needed, a translator will assist in clarifying instructions to student. Bilingual  glossaries and dictionaries are available to assist students access content area materials. When available, Spanish language  curriculum materials are provided to parents to enable them to support students with home based assignments.   When Title 3 funds are available, the school has an after school program for additional literacy and test preparation. The goal  of after school test preparation programs is to provide students with additional practice in the skills and strategies. required  for standardized testing. The rationale for such programs is that students need additional time and support in a small group  setting to facilitate the development of these skills. The goal of the arts enrichment program is to provide students with  additional access to drama, music and visual arts. The rationale is to provide all students with an opportunity to experience  success with and enjoyment of the arts. This program is funded in collaboration with a CBO, Sundog Theatre.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  The instructional materials used in the Freestanding ENL Program are as follows:  •     Write Time For Kids  •     Time For Kids Exploring Non- Fiction  •     Dual Language Library  •     Leveled Library for independent reading  •     Saludos- The Earth Is Our Home-Blue Level  •     Saludos- Gifts Of The Earth- red level  •     High Points Basic Book Shelf  •     Pearson Longman TOPS  •     Great Source Reading and Writing Sourcebook  •     Oxford Picture Dictionaries  •     Translation Dictionaries  •     RIGBY- On Our Way To English Wordly Wise Vocabulary-grades K-3  •     Sadlier- Oxford Vocabulary Workshop Program-Grades 4-5  •     Readworks and MyON online reading program  •  Home language materials includes Readworks and MyON which contains a leveled library of books in Spanish. This library  included fiction and non-fiction texts including informational texts in the content areas of science and social studies. Go Math  materials are available in Spanish to support students. Bilingual dictionaries and glossaries are also available.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Home language support is provided through the use of bilingual paraprofessionals, family workers, dual language libraries,  bilingual dictionaries and glossaries.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           83         Required services and resources are selected to correspond to the ELL students’ ages and grade levels.Common Core Learning  standards for each grade are consulted to ensure materials are rigorous and in line with expectations for students. Instruction  is altered to provide the scaffolding required for student success with the grade level curriculum. Material are adapted as  needed. Teachers meet by grade to collaboratively review curriculum and analyze student work. As part of this process,  teachers identify modifications to ensure accessibility to the curriculum for ELLs.   Related service providers group students by  age/grade when services are provided in a group setting.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    We do not share a building (co-location).     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Before the beginning of the school year, all parents including parents of ELLs are invited to attend an orientation at the school.  Students are invited to participate in a walk through of the school building to familiarize them with the school environment.  Families of newly admitted students during the school year are offered the same opportunities for orientation and  familiarization with the school environment.  The parent coordinator coordinates activities for new ELLs and their families. She  may be assisted by the guidance counselor, social worker, ENL teacher.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Language electives are not offered.      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   not applicable         Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Professional development continues on an ongoing basis throughout the school year. All teachers are engaging in a  professional development during the 80 minute scheduled period each Monday.  Our school will provide the following  Professional Development opportunities to all teachers of ELLs including common branch teachers,special education teachers,  speech teachers and the ENL teacher:  Units of study for writing and looking at students work in accordance with Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS)  Increasing teacher effectiveness in accordance with research based rubrics  Delivery of Common Core literacy curriculum (Core Knowledge grades K-2, Expeditionary Learning grades 3-5)  Effective questioning strategies and techniques  Total participation techniques to improve student engagement  Recording and analysis of running records       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           84      Setting and monitoring progress towards individualized student goals based on data  Differentiating instruction using Universal Design for Learning (UDL) model  Integrating technology into the standards based curriculum  Understanding and using data from assessments including New York State ELA, Math Science, NYSESLAT, LAB-R exams,  Periodic assessments such as TCWRP, NYC Performance Assessments, and ELL Interim Assessments  Collaborative inquiry protocols and strategies  In addition, the ENL teacher, general and special education teachers participate in relevant workshops held on district and  citywide level to receive additional training and support for improving teaching and learning for ELL students.     The principal and assistant principal participate in district and citywide professional development workshops.  Paraprofessionals attend a professional development workshop on a monthly basis. Specific training sessions are scheduled as  needed to provide paraprofessionals with skills and strategies to implement specific assignments.  Secretaries attend district and citywide professional development. In addition, secretaries are provided with professional  development by the certified ENL teacher in policies and practices for enrollment of students.  Professional development is provided to parent coordinators, guidance counselors, psychologists, speech teachers,  occupational and physical therapists on network and citywide basis. School facilitates the attendance of these providers at  these workshops.     PS 31 has partnered with Readworks for professional development. The focus of this professional development is to improve  reading comprehension with an emphasis on building vocabulary and background knowledge. Additional strategies that are  relevant for ELLs are incorporated into this work.   All staff are encouraged to pursue attendance at conferences and workshops . Teachers of ELLs were encouraged to attend  curriculum based professional development that was held over the summer. In addition, as noted above, teachers are  provided with continued training during in-school and outside workshops, on scaffolding curriculum to allow all students  including ELLs to meaningfully engage in the Common Core Learning standards. All teachers of ELLs including the ENL teacher  are part of a teacher inquiry team that meets weekly to analyze student performance in line with the standards. This inquiry  process creates additional professional development opportunities to align instruction with the standards based on individual  student needs.  Professional development is focused on building vocabulary to increase acquisition of English language skills, providing  multiple entry points into the curriculum and using formative assessments to develop effective instruction.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  As students transition from elementary to middle school additional support is provided to the staff. Representatives from the  middle school are invited to make presentations to our 5th grade teachers and students including ELLs and their parents in our  school to provide information about the programs that are available. Parents and students are invited to open houses at the  intermediate school to familiarize themselves with the programs and environment.

For all bilingual and English as a new language teachers, a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the required  professional development hours must be dedicated to language acquisition in alignment with core content area instruction,  including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for English  language learners.  This professional development includes attendance at workshops, participation in book studies and review  of supplemental instructional material for ELLs within the core curriculum.  The ENL teacher is available to model lessons to  classroom teachers. All teachers have access to professional materials such as the ELL resource library. Teachers are  encouraged to participate in other professional development opportunities that may be offered by the Department of  Education, UFT, etc. Participation in workshop instruction by the certified ENL teacher is documented with a sign-in sheet and  agenda. Documentation of ENL training is maintained in the ELL binder which is kept in room 311.            Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Annual meetings with parents are scheduled during Tuesday parent engagement time when practical. These meetings include  classroom teacher, ENL teacher and other staff necessary to sufficiently inform the parent or guardian about the child's  language development in all content areas in English. This meeting is conducted with a qualified interpreter/translator in the  language or mode of communication the parent or guardian best understands. If it is not practical for the parent/guardian to  meet during parent engagement time, the meeting will be scheduled at an alternative time during the school day. Attendance  will be recorded and maintained in the ELL critical document binder maintained in room 311.      In response to 2. below, records are kept in the ELL critical document binder. In addition, the parent coordinator maintains a  parent conference binder for all conferences.     2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   PS 31 has an open door policy for all parents including parents of ELLs allowing them access to school administrators and the  parent coordinator on a daily basis. Parents are invited to attend PTA meetings, curriculum workshops, two open school weeks  and parent teacher conferences. In addition, monthly progress reports are sent home for each student and parents are invited  to meet with the teachers to discuss the report.  Parents are encouraged to take part in the annual Learning Environment  Survey. Spanish language interpretation and translation is provided for all of the above activities. For other languages,  assistance from community members for interpretation and translation is requested. If it is not available, the interpretation  and translation unit is contacted.  There are additional opportunities for parents to become involved in the classroom.  Parents are also invited on class and  school trips. Parents may also serve as reading volunteers, learning leaders and volunteer translators/interpreters.     Staff members are available in the lobby each morning to facilitate accessibility to staff and information.     One of the parents on the School Leadership Team is an ELL parent.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Daniel Singleton, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.            2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           88                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   The William T Davis School                                                                              School DBN: 31R031  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      At registration, the pupil accounting secretary determines the primary language spoken by the parents based on  interview by a certified teacher and the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS). If a language other than  English is indicated, the certified ENL teacher or other qualified pedagogue interviews the student and parents.  The ENL teacher reviews the HLIS. Spanish bilingual paraprofessionals and a Chinese speaking parent coordinator  are available to translate and interpret at registration if needed. For other languages, the translation and  interpretation unit is called. Appropriate codes are entered in ATS and the school emergency card is noted to  identify preferred home language. There are several ATS reports that are run to determine translation and  interpretation needs of the parents in our school. The RHLA and RPOB are run as needed to ensure that parents  are provided with timely information in a language they can understand. For example translated versions of  report cards and progress reports are given to parents based on this information.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           90      Spanish bilingual family worker in the school assessment team members meet with parents of newly admitted  special education students to assess need for translation and interpretation.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     Written Preferred    Percent Written          Oral Preferred    Percent Oral          Language    The home language for  86.6% of our students is  English. Spanish is the  most common language  other than English. It  was reported as a home  language for 12.4% of  the students. The  remaining 1% of the  languages include  Arabic(.2% ), Ga.( .1% ),  Hausa (.1%) , and  Urdu(.1%).            3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.            Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services    1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be   distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.
