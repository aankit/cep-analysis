Background  Rise Schools have demonstrated:   ●   ●   they have the will and conditions in place to accelerate student growth and meet school improvement  benchmarks.  they have the capacity to lead/implement a school improvement strategy.   Rise Schools have seen some gains1 across multiple measures including graduation rates, college readiness, state  test scores and attendance. As a result, these schools will fully transition out of the Renewal Schools program at  the end of the 2017-2018 SY and continue under the guidance of the Office of Field Support, in partnership with  the Office of School Support and Supervision.    1All Rise Schools met at least 67% of their benchmarks, are not on the State’s Priority list, and have demonstrated a  sustainable school improvement structure that will allow them to build on their progress.    Six Rise Keys for Continued Improvement         1.  Strengthen the Instructional Core   2.  Strengthen Instructional Leadership Capacity   3.  4.  Apply a tiered approach to student intervention  5.  Promote a positive, inclusive school environment for students, staff, parents and   Improve Data Driven Practices   community partners  Increase monitoring and accountability   6.     Theory of Action  If the NYC Department of Education provides customized supports to Rise schools and principals designed around the  “Six Rise School Keys for continued improvement” then, Rise principals and their teams will have the tools and resources  to accelerate outcomes for ALL students and increase students’ access to an excellent and equitable education.    Structure of the Rise School Comprehensive Educational Plan (R-CEP)   The Rise School Comprehensive Educational Plan (R-CEP) will serve as the organizing and overarching document for each  Rise school and will be directly aligned and developed around the elements of the Framework for Great Schools, New  York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, and Strong Schools, Strong  Communities, including the following:   ●  Rise Benchmarks: please refer to the 2018-19 Rise benchmarks provided to your school.  ●  Establishing an overarching summative vision aligned with elements of the Framework for Great Schools and  documenting key areas of celebration and Rise through analysis of assessments and by envisioning what the  desired outcome for each school will be at the end of the School Rise process.    ●  Setting mid-year point benchmarks that create the path for improvement by focusing on desired outcomes and  goals. In this way, the plan will be mapped to the overarching summative vision. In addition to the five discrete  goals formed around the elements of the Framework for Great Schools, each school will create an action plan.  ●  Transformation into a community school in order to increase student and family access to physical and mental   health services and other social-emotional supports made available in or near the school.   ●  Expanded learning opportunities for all students, including additional instruction provided during afterschool   and/or summer programming provided in collaboration with community partners.   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          5         ●   Intensive professional development for all staff to ensure effective implementation of curriculum and  instruction aligned to the Next Generation Learning Standards (NGLS) and to support staff in effectively  responding to the differentiated academic and social-emotional needs of all students.   ●  Additional, focused strategies to increase parent and family engagement.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Information on the Framework for Great Schools and the DTSDE   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.     The Framework for Great Schools and the R-CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Rise School Comprehensive  Educational Plan (R-CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for  continuous improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review  and analysis of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities  and strategies that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.   In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.     2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          6         The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools      In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets, the American Institute of Research (AIR) Needs Assessment, the  NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative and qualitative data.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools – they call it a Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement.  All Priority and Focus Schools and Focus   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          7     Districts must use the new tool; and districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Education Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement         NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   I.  Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:     a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          8   a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)         It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the R-CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the R-CEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.     Next Steps for R-CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists in every Rise school and   meets all the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the American Institute of Research (AIR) needs   assessment, the school’s updated NYSED accountability status and most current quantitative and qualitative  data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Rise Key and the corresponding statement of   Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an  Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select  their SOPs. Schools that did not undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major  findings/recommendations from your most recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other  qualitative and quantitative data.       Step 4: Discuss and respond to the guiding questions under each Framework element.     Step 5: Revisit your school’s current goals, and strategically create new goals informed by the needs   assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART – Specific,  Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you monitor  progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you have identified, and will let your school  community know when you have reached your goal.     Step 6: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 7: Update your school’s AIS section. Title I schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement   Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 8: Complete the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) and the Community School sections.     Step 9: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether strategies and activities outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust practices along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Rise Program Priorities    Our Rise Theory of Action (page 4) is drawn from research1 on turnaround schools, the DOE Framework for Great  Schools, DTSDE Tenets, and the Quality Review, which suggest that these key priorities have the greatest impact on  student achievement.     2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          9         RISE Keys   Priorities      1.

Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including your school’s mission statement and a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or  special initiatives being implemented.   Identify any special student populations that the school has and what their specific needs are.   2.  3.  Describe your school’s approach to family engagement and progress made with establishing families as   partners in furthering student achievement    4.  Describe how your school is leveraging community school partnerships to support progress in elements of the   Framework for Great Schools and your Rise Benchmarks and indicate where this has been a challenge.   5.  Summarize the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) opportunities that have been offered to your students this year.      "At John Adams High School we hold ourselves responsible for fostering and sustaining a school wide culture of  lifelong learning, resulting in the skills and knowledge necessary for success in college and 21st century career  readiness."   John Adams High School Mission Statement      John Adams High School is a large, diverse NYC school with a student enrollment of 2,400. Formerly a priority and out  of time school, its status was changed to that of focus school effective July 1, 2016 and during SY 17-18 it was  announced that the school would be "graduating" from the Renewal program into RISE. This progression was  accomplished in large part due to major structural and instructional changes made over the course of the past several  years, which resulted in significant changes in our culture and practice, bringing both to closer alignment with our  mission statement. These changes include, but are not limited to, the establishment of Small Learning Communities  (SLCs) centered on specific interests and themes; the administration of monthly assessments designed to measure  student progress in core subject areas classes; the implementation of the inquiry cycle, in which the monthly  assessments play a key role in determining learning gaps and the impact of instructional strategies designed to  address them; a school wide focus on meaningful student engagement, feedback and student ownership of their  learning; the recognition that in order for student outcomes to improve adults as well as students must become  learners; and the implementation of a school wide system for supporting student social and emotional needs. In this  RCEP we will be analyzing the impact of our past work as well as laying out the framework for what steps we as a  school community will enact in order to continue and build upon the progress already made. Chief among our  priorities is the continued advancement of instruction and learning, as indicated by increases in credit accumulation,  Regents passing, and attendance rates, and ultimately, graduation rates. Equally important is an increase in college  and career readiness. In order to provide our students with the preparation and opportunities they deserve we have  instituted a series of initiatives with the combined goals of improving instruction and aligning it with the Common  Core Learning Standards, promoting the learning both of students and adults, and fostering a culture of collaboration  and engagement between students, parents, staff, and community. Examples of these initiatives are CLASS, the Judith  Hochman writing program, and PBIS.   The CLASS program is a two year school improvement and leadership development program offered through Hunter  College. The cohort which began this two year cycle in SY 17-18 is focusing on data analysis and the cycle of inquiry to  identify both learning gaps and the structural/instructional systems which contribute to the creation of those gaps;  the result is the development and implementation of evidence based cycles to change the identified obstacles to  learning and student growth. Due to the fact that CLASS participants also serve as SLC directors or work in other ways   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          14      to facilitate SLC common planning time it also is an important means for supporting the professional learning of other  staff members as well.    We incorporate writing across the curriculum into the inquiry cycle and base our work on the writing research of  Judith Hochman. This provides for a scaffolded approach for developing student writing, critical thinking skills, and  content knowledge, as well as inquiry based learning among staff members. David Coleman, one of the driving forces  behind the Common Core, has cited Hochman’s program as being an exemplary example of Common Core  implementation. In SY 15-16 Hochman specific writing strategies were introduced into grades 9-12 in all subject  classes and we since have been engaged in an ongoing revision process to better align these strategies with identified  learning gaps, create a pacing calendar for the introduction and release of some of the scaffolds, and to incorporate  writing assessment into our monthly department assessments.   The Positive Behavior Interventions and Support (PBIS) program operates from the understanding that behavioral and  academic concerns oftentimes are interrelated, and thus uses a two-pronged approach that addresses the needs of  the whole student. At John Adams we have created specific communication systems centered around transparency,  accountability and data collection, as well as systems for offering opportunities for the promotion of positive, pro- social behavior. PBIS serves as a framework through which our school is building a positive, supportive community  and like the CLASS participants, the PBIS team plays a key role in facilitating data inquiry, which in the case of PBIS  relates to topics such as attendance and family engagement. One of the very small number of large high schools to be  implementing PBIS, John Adams has been named a PBIS model site by the DOE and our program is overseen by a  mediation teacher. Our PBIS program is closely aligned with the Quality Review's rubric for a Positive Learning  Environment, in which we received a rating of Well-Developed for SY 16-17. The impact of PBIS also is reflected in our  attendance data (77.7% in SY11-12 vs. 86.4% for SY 17-18.) In order to broaden the PBIS menu of intervention  strategies SY 18-19 will see the introduction of Restorative Justice practices, particularly in the form of Restorative  Circles and a Youth Court program.   Taken together these programs represent our philosophy of student learning. At its foundation is the belief that in  order for students to learn adults must learn as well, with much of this adult learning represented by the inquiry cycle  (what do students need to know (curriculum, state standards, etc); what do they know (what prior knowledge do they  have and/or how much of what has been taught have they actually learned); how do we know this (how are we  assessing what students know); what do students still need to know (what learning gaps exist); how do we know this  (how are we assessing and measuring learning gaps); how will we teach new content and address learning gaps (what  instructional strategies are most effective, how will we provide multiple entry points, how will we promote rigor and  higher level thinking skills, how will students be engaged); how effective are our strategies (how will assess whether  what we are doing is working); and what are our next steps (how will we continue to improve student outcomes.) In  practice this translates into teaching from a rigorous curriculum aligned with Common Core/NYS standards,  implementing instructional strategies which meaningfully engage students (which we define as involving the minds of  all students in all phases of the lesson), assessing student learning, and providing students with immediate and  actionable feedback.   The Instructional Support Services Department conducts school-based professional development that supports  teachers in designing and implementing Individualized Education Plans and best practice strategies to educate  students with disabilities. The Danielson Framework and Advance are utilized as part of the observation and feedback  cycle, to propel professional growth. The ISS Department Common Planning Time includes work time to ensure that  ISS Teachers leave with collection of strategies and resources that will foster improved student learning through  developing a culture rooted in effective teacher practice. ISS Teachers will engage meaningfully in the work of  improving teacher practice through teacher reflection and development and understand how the instructional shifts  embedded within the Common Core Learning Standards and EngageNY inform improved teacher practice and Quality  IEP Development. Monthly targets are differentiated by the needs of John Adams High School, the Special Education  Department and Compliance to the PPR, CORe Checklist and the Transition SPP13. Weekly ISS Professional  Development is determined by monthly target goals and in response to teacher observation, assessment analysis,  teacher evaluation, feedback and support.    2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          15      Recognizing that strong family engagement with the school is a powerful contributor to student success, in SY 16-17  we launched the use of Kinvolved, which allows us to inform parents through texts and in real time about student  attendance. The program also allows us to send texts on any other issue, as well. During its first year in use 250,000  messages between the school and parents were sent and received, and several John Adams members were asked to  present a webinar guiding schools on successful implementation. Kinvolved was used by approximately 60% of staff  members and in SY 18-19 one of our goals is to increase usage even more.   Rigorous Instruction is one aspect of the Framework for Great Schools which has been improved over time.. While we  received a well developed on component 1.1 (rigorous and engaging curriculum) on the 2015-2016 Quality Review,  component 1.2 (developing teacher pedagogy) was our area of focus, and one for which we were evaluated as  developing. In short, while we had curriculum and structures to support rigor and high expectations, they not  translating into day-to-day classroom instruction. Rigor, then, became an important focus and inquiry target during SY  16-17, resulting in ratings of Well Developed for 1.1 (Curriculum), and Proficient in 1.2 (Pedagogy) and 3.4 (High  Expectations) in SY 16-17 Quality Review.   Our CBO is Global Kids and we have partnerships with a number of other organizations, including Northwell/LIJ, Urban  Arts, JetBlue, and AOL. Establishing the partnerships themselves was not particularly challenging, but it originally was  somewhat of a challenge to maintain the degree of consistency and ongoing presence necessary to achieve all of the  desired results; this largely has been due to limited resources, both financial and time. problematic has been the lack  of familiarity on the part of the CBO with DOE regulations, although with time this has been less of a problem than in  years past. The CBO also has been playing an increasingly important role in attendance outreach and has developed  an action plan, discussed later in this RCEP, to strengthen their work and extend their outreach.      Extended Learning Time is built into our students' programs and is differentiated to meet individual student need.  Included in our ELT options are College Now classes, Small Learning Community based electives, support programs  such as Reading Horizons, double periods in content areas of identified need, and classes for students who passed a  class but failed the Regents or passed the ELA and/or Math Regents but who did not achieve college readiness.                   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          16         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 27Q480   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   2281   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   YES   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide,   Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review?   John Adams did not receive a Quality Review for SY 17-18 but QR ratings for SY 16-17 indicate the school received a  rating of Proficient both in 1.2 (Pedagogy), 2.2 (Assessment). The school received Developing ratings for both of these  components in the Quality Review conducted during SY 15-16. Additionally, in SY 16-17 the school received a rating of  Well Developed in several other components related to rigorous instruction: 3.4 (High Expectations), and Well  Developed in 1.1 (Curriculum) and 1.4 (Positive Learning Environment).      Several years ago the school established that all curricula must be aligned with Common Core Learning Standards  (CCLS), and since that time has implemented the Engage NY curricula in all subject areas in which it is available, across  all grades and classes, including classes in English as a New Language (ENL) and Instructional Support Services (ISS).  When an Engage curriculum is not available another CCLS aligned curriculum, such as those developed by New Visions  for Science or the CUNY USH curriculum, are used in its place. An extensive system of tracking and monitoring, data  analysis, interventions and inquiry, which will be discussed later in this RCEP, has been developed and implemented in  order to support students and help them meet with the rigor demanded by the coursework.      The 2017-2018 school year saw a major focus placed on creating student self-efficacy and ownership of their learning.  This work actually had started in SY 16-17, which emphasized providing students with student friendly actionable and   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          19      specific feedback. In SY 17-18 this was broadened to include measuring the impact of that feedback on student work  and performance and also became a subject of Cabinet inquiry. As a result of that inquiry, along with data based on  Advance observations, informal instructional rounds, monthly department assessments, and student focus groups, a  major focus of SY 17-18 was on the use of performance tasks which result in productive student struggle, and in  supporting students with strategies for approaching such tasks. This resulted from our findings that while an individual  curriculum and lesson plan reflected an appropriate level of rigor, all too frequently teachers "watered down" material  through actions such as excessive scaffolding, not providing wait time, giving students answers to their questions  without showing them how to reach the answers themselves, etc. Just as the work from SY 16-17 was expanded in SY  17-18, the work done this year once again will be broadened to address appropriate use and removal of scaffold,  strategies for multiple entry points, etc, through a focus on differentiation throughout SY 18-19.      An area of strength in our school is the use of inquiry and the monitoring and revision of systems to measure the impact  of instruction and professional development. Approximately 60 teachers have received intensive training in the inquiry  process, which is turn keyed to other staff members. All teachers in the four core content areas have participated in  coaching and professional developed offered by coaches from the Office of School Renewal, and as was the case in SY  17-18, all teachers, counselors and APs Supervision in SY 18-19 will participate in formal inquiry work a minimum of  twice per week. Much of the work this year is centered on Danielson 1c, 1e, 3b, 3c, and 3d, and, supported by Engage,  WITSI, and inquiry training, the expectation is that this will lead to an increase in rigor, the use of data to make  appropriate instructional decisions, and increased alignment between CCLS, student need, and the curricula, as well as  increased alignment with Danielson. An additional inquiry focus during SY 18-19 will be on meeting the learning needs  of ENL students and will be discussed elsewhere in this RCEP.   Priority Need: Continue to work towards building a school and classroom culture of providing students with daily  opportunities for productive struggle in all their classes and to differentiate instruction as a means of doing so.           Part 2 – Summative Vision for Rigorous Instruction   What is your school’s instructional focus? What is your vision for promoting the instructional focus consistently across  classrooms?       Our instructional focus for SY 18-19 is as follows:   If teachers plan, implement, and differentiate lessons that meaningfully engage students in rigorous skills and content  and give actionable feedback with the expectation that students will act on and revise based on that feedback, then  students will develop critical thinking skills and ownership of the learning.      Based on inquiry, data analysis, and Advance reports, a determination has been made that professional development  regarding performance tasks, productive struggle, and differentiation will be key aspects of our work in the 2018-2019  school year. This focus will allow us to continue to work towards embedding rigor and a sense of ownership in our  students while simultaneously developing critical thinking skills, all being concepts incorporated into our Instructional  Focus.   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          20      One of our guiding principles, and an important element of school culture, is that in order for students to learn, adults  must learn as well, and this principle will continue to be the framework for consistent promotion of our instructional  focus across departments and classrooms. Adult learning will be promoted through practices such as:   1.) Weekly professional development on topics aligned with our Instructional Focus.   2.) Regularly scheduled common planning time (eight times per month) during which teachers can review lesson plans,  analyze student work, and share best practices.   3.) Teacher text based discussions on professional topics.   4.) ENL and ISS teachers will participate in content area PD, in order to share best practices with General Ed teachers  and in return become familiar with Regents and content area requirements.   Outside the individual classroom, at the larger department and school wide levels, all required curricula in the four core  content areas (English Language Arts, Math, Science, and Social Studies) is based either on the appropriate NYS Engage  curriculum or a similar standards based, such as designed by New Visions or CUNY, when available. This curricula is  designed to align with the engagement and rigorous aspects of our instructional focus, while a series of scaffolded  supports such as the WIT help students meet the levels of rigor involved while simultaneously developing their critical  thinking skills, another key aspect of our instructional focus. Departments have built into their pacing calendars and/or  unit plans opportunities for students to formally revise their work based on actionable feedback received from  teachers. Consistent use of strategies such as these raised our Quality Review Rating for component 2.2, Assessment,  from developing in SY 15-16 to proficient in SY 16-17.   Taken together, these structures and strategies-for student assessment and ownership of their own learning, providing  a rigorous curriculum, creating opportunities for students to act on feedback and revise their work and ultimately to  assess and take ownership of their own learning-have become an essential part of our school culture, and the  expectation is that at the start of SY 18-19 they will be reviewed and revised in response to end of SY 17-18 data.. In  addition, expanded learning time will continue to provide both students and staff with opportunities to continue  building rigorous learning experiences. Whether an individual student is in a Regents review or SAT prep class, an  enrichment class or skills building class, the expectation will be that the instruction and learning represent a true  reflection of our theory of action, which, summarized, attests to the linkage between appropriately challenging tasks  related to the analysis of all genres of text, which, when provided with the appropriate scaffolds and supports, will  result in the ability to think broadly and deeply. In practice, then, much of ELT will seek to develop student critical  thinking and analytical skills through the use of rigorous text, within the framework of classes based on student need  (i.e., literacy or math support classes, credit accumulation classes, College Now classes, etc.)          How will you implement a standards-aligned curricula that meets the needs of your diverse learners, including ELLs  and SWDs?  We recognize that our students come to us with a wide range of personal, academic, social-emotional concerns and  represent a wide range of diverse cultural heritages. By way of background, the Engage NY curricula is used in all of our  ELA and Math classes, included ISS and ENL classes. In order to meet these needs we have introduced a broad range of  academic and social/emotional initiatives so that students will be supported in meeting the accompanying rigor  demanded by this curricula. To provide context it should be noted that Engage ELA and Math units are used in all classes  in those departments, including all ISS and ENL classes (and hence the upcoming emphasis on differentiation as a means  of continuing to support students in meeting rigorous standards). For those subjects in which Engage is not available a  New Visions based, or in the case of USH, CUNY based curriculum, is used.   Our initiatives will be discussed in more depth in other sections. However, academic needs are met through use of the  WIT program, both teacher and student facing trackers used in individual classes, an in-house developed IEP tracker   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          21            (the IEP at a Glance), and instructional strategies designed to engage students with their learning and provide them with  appropriate and actionable feedback. This latter component has expanded successfully over the past two school years  so that students became more directly aware of their own individual goals and learning gaps; the strategies chosen  were based on a vision of students being better able to explain what it is they are being expected to learn and to do,  how a particular activity in which they are engaged assists them in doing so, and how that is enabling them to reach  their learning goals. These existing practices will be built upon over the course of SY 18-19; for example, student facing  trackers will be revised to include an opportunity for them to choose their own individualized goals in addition to the  skill and content goals of the unit, and a new EDAT @ a Glance, modeled on the demonstrably successful IEP @ a  Glance, will be launched.   Personal and cultural needs requiring support for successful implementation of the Common Core to occur are  addressed through structures and programs such as PBIS, Small Learning Communities, and our school based health  clinic, as well as through what will be an increased focus on cultural diversity during the 2018-2019 school year.     What is your vision for ensuring that all student have access to rigorous coursework that moves them towards career  and college readiness? How will you support the personal and academic skills, habits, and behaviors needed for  students to be career and college ready?  In recognition of the fact that students must develop skills which allow for success in college and career but that the  path to this readiness will be different for different students, we have developed a variety of course offerings designed  to support students in this respect, and have been working towards spreading instructional shifts to support this  throughout all of our classes.   Over the course of the past several years we have instituted a number of new courses and programs, including Junior  Airforce ROTC, additional College Now classes, block scheduling for all students taking Global History and for those  students whose data indicate would benefit from it in other targeted courses, and specialized classes for students who  have not yet passed a Regents, or who passed it but not with a grade indicative of college readiness. In addition, we  became an official IB (International Baccalaureate) school in September 2016, allow all interested students to register  for Advanced Placement classes, participate in the Co-Op Tech program, received CTE recognition for our Law program  and are working towards recognition for our Virtual Enterprise and EMT programs. We received approval for our IB  program to become a screened program starting in SY 17-18, and redesigned two of our SLCs, based on student and  parent feedback received at events such as high school fairs and the Community School Forum; our Environmental SLC  became the screened Future Educator Academy, while the Medical and Fitness SLC transitioned into Pre-Med.  Additional programs will be implemented in SY 18-19, with examples including a Connect to College program offered  through Queensborough Community College and, reflecting our participation in the College Access for All program,  ninth grade students will be programmed for a course designed to prepare them for college and college readiness.   Regardless of the particular class, high expectations for students and staff alike are becoming more and more a part of  school culture and are reflected in instructional shifts. For the past four years we have looked at instruction through the  lens of meaningful student engagement, and in recognition of the instructional shifts required of the Common Core,  data analysis, and the creation both of district and school initiatives, have expanded it to its present formulation.  Building upon the SY 16-17 instructional shifts of providing students with clearer, specific, and actionable feedback so  that they can become supported in understanding and acting upon it, SY 17-18 added a particular focus on performance  tasks and productive struggle, and SY 18-19 will continue this emphasis and use feedback to students and learning gaps  identitifed both on monthly department assessments and teacher facing trackers, among other things, as a framework  on which to increase differentiation.      How do you envision embedding the elements of culturally responsive instruction and how will you know that  implementation is successful?  Culturally responsive instructional and pedagogical practices to be used during SY 18-19 will include:   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          22         1.) Expanding the Engage NY curriculum with the works of culturally diverse writers.   2.) Using our library data base of articles/journals to supplement classroom texts with diverse viewpoints and  experiences.   3.) Linking each content unit to an Essential Question which, when answered, will allow students to bring their own  viewpoints, experiences, and backgrounds into their answers.   4.) The school will continue to host an annual Multicultural Festival.   5.) Planning lessons which allow for multiple entry points to allow for increased student choice.   6.) Holding student focus groups to gain insight into what students themselves would find responsive.     What is your vision for the use of a comprehensive assessment strategy (diagnostic, formative, benchmark, and  summative) to drive curricular, instructional, and organizational decisions that impact student outcomes?  While not specifically mentioned in our Instructional Focus, assessment underscores almost all aspects of it. Meaningful  engagement provides an opportunity to assess student learning; assessment must occur in order to determine whether  content is at a sufficient level of rigor; decisions regarding the impact of instructional strategies and scaffolds cannot be  made without valid assessment; and feedback to students is meaningless without an assessment of its impact on  student revision and learning. In recognition of the importance of (valid) assessment (and using assessments to drive  data based instruction and decision making), John Adams has developed a comprehensive assessment strategy which  drives our curricular, instructional, and organizational decisions so that every decision made promotes positive student  outcomes.   One important component of our assessment practices is our monthly department assessments, given in all four core  content area and ENL class culminating in either the Regents or LOTE (Language other than English) exams. These  assessments are cumulative, serve both a formative and summative purpose, and are deeply embedded with our  inquiry work.   Monthly assessments are summative in that they assess student learning from the start of the school year to the point  at which they are administered each month. Teachers analyze the results and determine which skills and content both  the class as a whole and individual students have mastered, and where learning gaps still exist. Instructional strategies  then are shared during department CPT (common planning time) meetings, and teachers implement these strategies  into their planning and instruction. The following month's assessment contains both material taught since the time of  the last assessment as well as questions based on learning gaps identified in the earlier assessments, to determine  whether the strategies utilized have been successful. Assessments are formative in that analysis of what was learned  and what was not then serves as a basis for what must be incorporated into future lessons. All of this data is placed into  a Google based template, providing transparency for teachers and administrators alike. Assistant principals use this data  when conducting professional development, observations, or other interactions with teachers, and the transparent  nature of the template allows teachers to determine whether there are colleagues meeting with success whose classes  they would find it beneficial to visit.   WIT centered inquiry, also conducted during department CPT, serves as another form of assessment. During this time  teachers review student work to assess the impact of WIT strategies not just on writing but on vocabulary development  and content knowledge as well.   During the past two school years we introduced and then solidified additional components of our overall assessment  strategy. The first of these consists of two separate sets of skills and content trackers, one teacher facing and the second  student facing. Both of these consist of skills/vocabulary/content that must be taught and learned over the course of an  individual unit, and use of the trackers allow both teacher and student to measure progress, identify areas of strength,   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          23         and target areas needing additional supports. Starting in the 2018-2019 school year we will move to the next step with  these trackers, using the teacher facing one to help promote differentiation and the student facing one to enable  students to measure their own progress, identify individual goals, and develop increased ownership of their learning.    Assessment can be conducted in numerous ways and, outside of the formal systems described above, we also have  conducted assessment through the use of student focus groups. These groups are designed to provide staff and  administrators insight into student perceptions of the utility and helpfulness of our various structures; for example,  during SY 17-18 focus groups gave their thinking on the quality of feedback from teachers and the types of feedback,  activities, notes, etc, they found most helpful. These topics were selected in part due to a perceived need arising from  Cabinet inquiry (ie, the alignment between the Instructional Focus, planning, and classroom instruction). While the  student focus group topics for SY 18-19 have yet to be determined, one potential topic would be the impact of our  efforts to increase the types and quality of differentiation.     How do you envision differentiating teacher professional learning opportunities to support instructional foci, meet  students’ unique needs and advance culturally responsive education in your school?  As previously stated one of our core beliefs is that in order for students to become learners adults must become  learners as well. Since adults, like students, come to their learning from different places and with different skills,  capacities, and knowledge it is important that, as is the case with student learning, adult learning be differentiated as  well. In recognition of this fact differentiated professional learning opportunities at John Adams take a number of  different forms, including:   1.) Presentations conducted by our team of Peer Collaborative Teachers (PCTs). These workshops focus on needed  topics identified by a variety of data points, such as teacher surveys, incident reports, academic data, inquiry, and  observation reports and address a range of topics, such as lesson planning, student assessment, classroom  management, team teaching, data analysis, and differentiation. Workshops are provided throughout the day, with  teachers choosing which ones they best believe are most relevant to them.   2.) Our PBIS team conducts workshops designed to assist staff in recognizing and support student social-emotional  needs. Typical topics include bullying, LGBTQ concerns, and social media misuse.    3.) Our school has an extensive mindfulness program, with teachers receiving PD on student stress, text anxiety, signs of  depression, and causes of acting out. Our meditation room is used for a variety of programs throughout the day,  including mindfulness classes and workshops for students identified as at risk.   4.) Like the PCTs, the UFT Teacher Center conducts a series of workshops and professional development programs,  typically centering on school initiatives and instructional strategies. As with the PCT workshops teachers choose those of  relevance to them.   5.) Department common planning time is structured to allow opportunities for General Education, ENL, and ISS teachers  to interact with each other to promote shared knowledge regarding content and skill requirements, and strategies to  enable all students to master those requirements.   6.) Department intervisitations, conducted on our Friday teacher collaboration days, allow teachers the opportunity to  visit colleagues' classes to see the implementation of a variety of strategies and initiativies, some school or department  based and others unique to the teacher being visited.   7.) Departments often use professional development days for teacher led presentations typically centering on data  analysis, steps taken to close learning gaps, and the impact of this work.   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          24      8.) Our model teachers make their classrooms available to those interested in seeing the implementation of topics  typically addressed during PCT or UFT Teacher Center workshops.   9.) Our CBO, Global Kids, runs programs on increasing student attendance and the culture of those countries from which  we receive large numbers of students.

Indicate resources you will leverage to achieve this annual goal and implement this action plan, including  human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, lead CBO’s community school budget, FSC Supports,  etc.  Resources to be leveraged include outside instructional coaches, department common planning time; SLC common  planning time; weekly professional development meetings; AP inquiry meetings.    Resources to also be used in order to support our growing CTE, IB, and STEM programs. We will need professional  development, instructional supplies, and equipment in order to provide sufficient resources for these programs.   Funds will also continue to be allocated in order to brand our two new SLC's as explained above. Our JROTC program  moving into its fourth full year, will be funded to support new activities such as drill team events.    Students will have the opportunity to become certified in a number of different computer applications as we  purchased the Certiport exams. Additionally, The school funds the Virtual Enterprise program.   Finally, the school will be funding the building of a court room within the school in order to help advance our CTE  certified Law program and have a space to implement a youth court which will be discussed later on.

Similar to your Annual Goal, your mid-point benchmark should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and  Time-bound.  By Feb. 2019 credit accumulation will be at least 1 point higher than it was in Feb. 2018, as measured by the overall  number of credits earned by content area.     Part 6b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress.  Progress will be monitored through growth demonstrated on monthly benchmark assessments comprised of course  required skills and content. These benchmarks are cumulative throughout the year, are aligned with course content  and Regents questions, and are used as predictors for success in the course and Regents.      2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          28         Part 6c.

The school has demonstrated significant growth into a safe learning environment that uses a strategic plan to identify,  analyze, and support the social-emotional developmental health of students, resulting in measurable progress in  targeted areas. Source: DTSDE Report, p. 19   The Positive Behavior Interventions and Support (PBIS) program operates from the understanding that behavioral and  academic concerns oftentimes are interrelated, and thus uses a two-pronged approach that addresses the needs of the  whole student. At John Adams, a specific communication system was created, centered on transparency, accountability  and data collection, as well as systems for offering opportunities for the promotion of positive, pro-social behavior. PBIS  serves as a framework through which the school is building a positive, supportive community, and plays a key role in  facilitating data inquiry, which in the case of PBIS relates to topics such as attendance and family engagement. As one of  the very small number of large comprehensive high schools to be implementing PBIS, John Adams has been named a  PBIS model site by the Department of Education, has hosted numerous schools seeking to implement programs of their  own, both from within and outside the DOE, and is a past recipient of the citywide award from the Office of School  Wellness for the work being done. In SY 17-18 there were 35 Superintendent Suspensions. In order to continue to   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          30      reduce suspensions, provide additional social/emotional supports to at-risk students, and foster a supportive, rather  than punitive school environment, SY 18-19 will see the implementation of restorative justice programs and structures.   In order to continue this work in SY 18-19 John Adams has applied for and received several grants and/or partnerships.  These include the Upward Bound program at St. John's University, the Learn 2 Breathe program, and a project to be  conducted with the Psychology department at Hunter College. In addition, the school will be participating in the NYS  Mentoring Program, conducted through the Office of Children and Family Services. Also important will be continued  outreach to families, and strengthening the role and presence of Global Kids, our CBO. New for the current school year  is our partnership with Ramapo House for Children, which is training interested staff members in restorative circle  practices as well as restorative justice in general. This partnership was created in response to the increase in  suspensions SY 17-18 over the previous year. A deeper analysis revealed that a significant part of this increase was due  to repeat offenders, leading to a determination that new approaches must be taken in supporting these students. Staff  members then will turn key their learning to other staff. Restorative programs are the outgrowth of a data    Priority Need: Continue to systematically promote a vision for social and emotional developmental health that is  connected to data and learning experiences and results in creating a safer and healthier environment for families, staff,  and students.         Part 2 – Summative Vision for Supportive Environment   What is your vision for a supportive school environment? How will you, in partnership with each CBO and families,  enact your vision?  For the past several years John Adams has placed a strong emphasis on changing school culture from that of a punitive  environment to one which supports the academic, social, and emotional needs of students, families, and staff members,  and we have been successful in doing so. For example, the SY 16-17 Quality Review rates us "Well Developed" with  respect to a positive learning environment and "Proficient" in high expectations; additionally, in June 2017 we received  an award from the Office of School Wellness for our work in these areas. Our goal in SY 18-19 is to review the impact of  our systems, implementing new ones when necessary, in order to maintain our well developed rating and move our  proficient in high expectations to well developed.       Our vision of a supportive school environment is one in which all members of the school community not only feel  supported, but, in fact, actually are in a way which has a positive impact. Our designation as a Community School  provides a pathway for those supports in that students receive health (physical and mental) supports and benefit from  an array of programs and organizations working in the building, our CBO currently being Global Kids. Working with and  through our CBO, and through separate school based programs, we envision supports in SY 18-19 to incorporate the  continuation of the following:      1.) Our CBO, runs a series of after school programs; many of their workshops are designed to support at risk students  with social/emotional needs and/or attendance issues. In addition to these workshops, however, they also offer  enrichment activities, such as computer and dance activities. The Urban Arts program provides additional enrichment  activities as well as academic supports. In another form of support of student social and emotional learning our CBO  works closely with our Parent Coordinator to provide outreach to parents and provide workshops based on parent  interests. Currently we are seeking to obtain funding to continue Urban Arts for SY 18-19.      2.) John Adams Student Government meets once a week to discuss various student activities and student issues at our  school. The Principal comes to the meetings to address any of the issues that students have. As far as the activities go   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          31      the school supports most of the activities that the students desire. Representatives from the student government also  sit on several school committees, such as the school Safety committee and the school’s leadership team.      3.) John Adams is entering its fifth year of PBIS implementation. Systems have been created and protocols have been  put in place that allow for behavioral and academic supports. As PBIS implementation continues, it is forming the  framework from within which all school wide systems and operations can work together toward the singular purpose of  providing a supportive environment for students and staff.      4.) The school has developed a set of positively worded behavioral expectations that are building wide and universal.  These expectations are visible throughout the building on prominently posted signage. These expectations are also  taught in classroom settings in regular intervals and reinforced via a formal reward system known as the Rack Em Up  system. The Rack Em Up system involves staff members giving a ticket to a student when they display behavior  consistent with the language of the behavioral expectations matrix, thereby providing instant gratification and  recognition. These tickets can be redeemed for prizes once a month in the cafeteria. A referral system is also in place  that allows for informed decision making about student supports including counseling. This referral system is online and  visible to all concerned parties so that real time conversations can take place and decisive action be taken within  effective and appropriate time periods.      5.) With Google as the platform for communication and data tracking, PBIS assigns students to one of three tiers, each  one having more intensive supports available. At the same time, the system tracks all behavioral referral forms  submitted for behavioral infractions. The correlation between supports being offered and behavioral performance  allows for informed decisions to be made about the effectiveness of individual supports as they apply to each student  on a case by case basis.      6.) The data collected regarding both behavioral performance and supports offered, along with feedback from family  and community members, paint a picture of what has and has not worked as well as might have the most potential for  success in the future.      7.) Our teacher-led PBIS committee allows for not only the creation and maintenance of a supportive environment but  provides a strong framework for teacher collaboration and community building. PBIS has become a cornerstone of our  school renewal efforts. It has been used as a framework for directly impacting behavioral and academic issues among  students. This includes; student led mediation classes, student advisory, peer mentoring, staff mentoring, check in check  out , targeted tutoring/inquiry, counseling, mental health assessments, professional development for students and staff  community building events and other supports for promoting desired behaviors. During the last three years these  efforts resulted in an almost 50% decrease in superintendent suspensions, a 2.5 increase in attendance, and a sustained  increase in parent participation in events such as PA meetings. As a nationally recognized PBIS school we will continue in  SY 18-19 to support crucial concerns such as student social/emotional health, emotional regulation, classroom  management, and parent engagement. PBIS will be expanded to build upon the structure for Chancellor’s initiatives  such as restorative justice. In order to further design our school as a true Community School and recognize the  importance of addressing student social/emotional needs our guidance and security departments will follow the PBIS  framework; we will be supported in this work not only by PBIS but by our CBO as well.   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          32         8.) Teachers play various roles in order to support these various aspects of student success, including SLC directors,  Deans of Student Life, and a lead Guidance Counselor.      In SY 18-19 the following new programs/strategies will be implemented:      1.) We are beginning a new neuroscience track program in our new Pre-Med Small Learning Community. Neuroscience  will encompass research, biofeedback, and virtual reality units, all designed to help students practice coping strategies  when dealing with stressful situations.      2.) We have developed a partnership with Hunter College. Through its Psychology Department, our science research  class will receive support with creating apps to improve stress management skills. Students also will visit the Hunter  College psychology labs and be afforded the opportunity to present their findings at a relevant professional association  conference.      3.) A renewed partnership with the "Changing Minds Program" will continue to allow us to bring in a consultant that will  blend meditative practices both for students and parents with film making. The consultant will work with our  Administrative Staff to review and edit the film material gathered last year. This will culminate in a final film production  documenting social, emotional, behavioral, and academic initiatives surrounding the neuroscience pathway.       4.) The $250,000 grant obtained through collaboration with St. John's University will enter year two implementing an  after school and Saturday program that incorporates meditation, tutoring, and cycling into the curriculum. A component  program, Cycle Smarts, will incorporate bicycle skills via Physical Education classes and will include a literacy, science,  and math component.   5) A relationship with Mndfl ED, a CBO supporting meditative practices will commence and be used to add expert  teaching to the existing curriculum.   6) The relationship with Ramapo for Children will enter year two focusing on school-wide Restorative Justice practices  and circles.   7) A CBO (Global Kids) and school staff member jointly attended a week long training program in mindful education  practices. Both staff and students will receive turnkey training to enable them to become more mindful of teaching and  learning.         Describe your plan to implement a culture of trust and high expectations for teachers, students, families and  community partners.   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          33      A culture of trust and high expectations is dependent on a number of factors, such as transparency, communication,  honest feedback, professional learning, and support. At John Adams we will continue to create this type of culture  through:   1.) Use of our PBIS and Rack 'em Up system, which recognizes all members of the school community who have  evidenced support or assistance towards one another and/or school goals.   2.) Student focus groups, held at the school, department, and SLC levels.   3.) Supporting adults' professional learning, through school structures such as intervisitations and teacher led  workshops, and through supporting their outside learning as well.   4.) Implementation of our restorative justice program in SY 18-19.   5.) Department representation at administrative/cabinet meetings, in order to gain further insights, suggestions, and  feedback.   6.) Continued outreach on the part of the CBO to families and the community.           Who are your CBO partners? How will each CBO sustain and support the social-emotional and academic growth of  your students?   CBO Partner   CBO Focus   Global Kids   Global Kids   Attendance/AIS   At risk students          How will you, in partnership with your CBO, create a supportive and engaging environment for your students’  families?  1. There are multiple avenues by which partnering with Global Kids will help create a supportive environment and  engagement for John Adams families. We will work with Global Kids to build a strong Community School Team that will  be sure to include parent leaders. As part of this collective, members will engage in decisions and actions that will  strengthen the school environment and build relationships with community establishments so as to bring in more  resources to our students and families.       2. The lead CBO will work closely with the Parent Coordinator and PTA board in engaging more families in order to  increase attendance at Monthly PTA meetings, school events/meetings and opportunities in the community. Global Kids  will strategize alongside the PTA with how to recreate the monthly meetings so as to create a more dynamic setting that  will incentivize family attendance. This will include re-engaging our alumni parents to speak with current  parents/families in the school who have seniors who are college bound. We will also re-strategize the way in which we  outreach to parents about PTA meetings. This may include door-too-door visits or sending newsletters home, as well as  promoting PTA meetings at school-wide events such as Open House and Freshmen Orientation.       3. The lead CBO partners with each SLC to support their attendance inquiries. Since May 2016, the lead CBO has  engaged with at least 25 families to offer additional supports to students whose attendance is considered chronically  absent or at-risk of becoming chronically absent. In SY 2018-2019, each SLC will continue our past practice of conducting   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          34         ongoing gatherings for parents to attend; Global Kids staff will work with SLC directors in creating agendas, outreach  and facilitating these meetings.       4. Community School Events such as Family Night and the Community School Forum are aimed to engage John Adams  families in getting to know one another, as well as to create a space for the school to hear from them in how they think  the school can continue to grow. Coordination efforts for both of these events are spearheaded by the lead CBO.       5. Through the lead CBO, a partnership was started with Action NYC, an organization that offers legal immigration  consultations and services to students and families. Action NYC conducted screenings with 37 John Adams  students/families to determine whether legal support could be offered. The resource was well received and we are  looking to continue the relationship in SY 2018-2019.      6. The Office of Community Schools assigns a Family Outreach Specialist to each school site. The school and lead CBO  intends to use our Family Outreach Specialist as a resource to bring in leadership development workshops for parents  who will be identified as leaders in our school.      7. During SY 2017-2018 the Parent Coordinator brought in a community resource who conducted weekly workshops for  parents that touched on the subjects tax preparation, professional development and computer skills. Community school  funds were used to pay for the facilitator and we plan to support different aspects of this initiative in SY 2018-2019.      What essential questions, or key themes, will be explored by all staff and students that acknowledge and celebrate the  culture and heritage of the student body?  At the June 2018 Chancellors' Day faculty conference the concept of culturally responsive education was introduced to  staff. During the 2018-2019 school year John Adams intends to take a two pronged approach to this.    1.) One key theme will be to promote a sense of efficacy among all students. A major way we will do this will be to  continue to ensure that our instructional focus is implemented fully, across all departments and classrooms, for one key  aspect of our focus is the development of this self-efficacy. Many of the strategies addressed in other sections of this  RCEP, such as student facing unit trackers, providing students with actionable feedback, the use of intervention tasks,  and student focus groups, work towards this goal. Students need to develop not only the skills, but the confidence, as  well, to know that they can approach rigorous tasks successfully, and succeed once they leave high school.   2.) Two of the major goals of our PBIS program is to make the school more welcoming and to be more mindful of what  we do and how we treat one another; this is in natural alignment with acknowledging and celebrating students' culture  and heritage. This will be done in various ways, such as the acknowledgement of culturally important events through  announcements, banners, etc; continuation of our annual Multicultural Celebration; school/family/community events  sponsored by our CBO; and inviting representatives from local cultural groups to speak at or organize school events.

Your goal must be consistent with the  expectations in part 2, responsive to the identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART –  Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Meeting your SMART goal should directly impact  meeting at least one of your Rise Benchmarks.

Indicate resources you will leverage to achieve this annual goal and implement this action plan, including  human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, lead CBO’s community school budget, FSC Supports,  etc.  Leverageable resources include the use of social/emotional school based mentors and support teams, as well as our  partnership with our CBO, Global Kids, and the School Based Health Clinic sponsored by Northwell/LIIJ. Instructional  resources include a mindfulness/meditation program. AIDP funding will be used to support after-school intervention  and outreach to be provided by teachers, attendance teachers guidance counselors, and school aides working 8  hours/week.   Resources will also be allocated in order to ensure access to PBIS data on Google applications. A sufficient number of  updated computers must be available to staff members in order to analyze PBIS data and to log an pertinent  information of their own. By student request we have a new Mac Photo Lab as part of our Fine Arts program.   Funds will be allocated for tutoring and other academic supports as directed by the grant that the school received.  Funds will also be allocated for workshops and other supports in the 2Breathe program. The school will continue to  allocate funds in support of the growing PBIS program through professional development and supplies.   Funds will also be allocated to pay staff members to attend/chaperone the Freshmen Orientation, Open House, High  School Recruitment Fairs, parent information nights, and parent education workshops.

Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement  planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal.  Similar to your Annual Goal, your mid-point benchmark should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and  Time-bound.  By the end of the Fall 2018 semester (ie, by Feb. 1, 2019), attendance will be .5% higher than it was at the end of the  Fall 2018 semester, as measured by official DOE attendance reports.

What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide,   Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review?   John Adams received a preliminary rating of "Well Developed" in 4.2 (Teacher Teams and Leadership Development) in  the Quality Review for SY 16-17.   Formal, structural opportunities for collaboration are provided through common planning time and professional  development days. Departments meet for professional development once per week, and for two days on alternate  weeks, with the off weeks used for SLC common planning. Additional collaboration occurs during the weekly Teacher  Collaboration Day, at which point teachers choose from a menu of activities, such as visits to WIT Learning Labs  (demonstration classrooms for modeling of WIT strategies), participation in the PBIS Committee, attending workshops in  the UFT Teacher Center, participating in PCT led workshops, or intervisitation of content area classes. All of this  collaborative work is tracked on a google based document, providing transparency regarding areas of teacher interest  and both self identified need and needs identified by the administration. The google template also is used to indicate  the next steps classroom visitors and workshop participants will bring into their own instruction, as well as to track the  impact of these steps. This overall framework for teacher collaboration thus allows for equal measures of content and  interdisciplinary planning, addresses school wide areas of instructional focus while also allowing for teacher choice,  monitors informal participation and selection, promotes reflection in the self-determination of next steps, and promotes  accountability. Additionally, short term and long term impact can be measured through formal and informal  observations, the review of student work conducted during inquiry, closing skill/content gaps as measured by monthly  assessment and semester credit accumulation, and Regents passing and graduation rates. Inquiry work will continue to  be supported by the data team, which will analyze data by cohort and subgroup to assess the progress made by each,  determine patterns, if any, and to work with counselors, department APs, PCTs, and SLC directors in targeting high  leverage students. Our data team also will continue to work with the testing coordinatior, program chair, assistant   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          40      program chair, and guidance counselors to ensure that students are programmed for the Regents in such a way to  maximize not only graduation, but college readiness as well.   In order to promote not just collaboration, but meaningful and effective collaboration, teachers (in fact, all staff  members), have access to high leverage data points which closely measure the correlation between types of attendance  outreach made and actual attendance, the monthly progress made in closing identified gaps, and the impact of PBIS  interventions on students needing social/emotional supports, among others.    Our priority in SY 18-19 will be to continue a fuller integration of General Education, ISS, and ENL teachers in order to  better provide additional opportunities for planning and collaboration, increase familiarity with content requirements  (for ENL and ISS teachers), expand the menu of instructional strategies, particularly for differentiating instruction,  strengthen team teaching pairs, and ultimately, improve instruction and student outcomes.         Part 2 – Summative Vision for Collaborative Teachers   What is your vision for collaborative teaching?     Collaboration is not something that should be viewed as limited to co-teaching teams or to members of the same  department. Simply put, our vision for collaborative teaching is that teachers, and, in fact, all staff members, will work  together to implement the goals put forth in our instructional vision. The high degree of collaboration necessary to  achieve this necessitates, among other things, planning, teacher intervisitation and feedback, data analysis, creation of  common assessments, analysis of student work and feedback provided to such, and measuring the effectiveness and  impact of this work.    Our school is structured so that teachers have opportunities for collaboration at the department level, grade level, and  through interdisciplinary SLCs. All teachers participate in the inquiry both at department and SLC common planning  meetings; these meetings occur twice per week and alternate between department week and SLC week (it should be  noted that department based professional development occurs one day every week). Whether at the department or SLC  levels inquiry is supported not just by assistant principals, but by teachers who have received training to act as inquiry  facilitators; this training may have been received in a variety of settings, such as the CLASS program, UFT Teacher  Center, as a PCT or model teacher, or through school based professional development. While not every teacher has  been trained as an inquiry leader, virtually every teacher and counselor is engaged in one or another type of inquiry on a  weekly basis, with department inquiry focusing on academic issues through the formulation of a department based  problem of practice, while SLC inquiry typically focuses on topics such as attendance and outreach.   Our school wide instructional focus incorporates the major elements of effective instruction, such as meaningful  engagement, rigor, actionable feedback, revision based on that feedback, and the development of student self efficacy.  Our instructional focus also is aligned with the Danielson rubric, with a particular emphasis on components 1e, 3b, 3c,  and 3d, for it is these components which underlie the expectations of what effective unit and lesson plans look like, and  what effective implementation looks like.   We have a school structure in place to deepen opportunities for higher achieving students, and this structure includes  programs such as Advanced Placement classes, College Now, STEM, and an IB (International Baccalaureate) program.  Due to student interest we also have reformulated two of our SLCs, with Environmental Science transitioned into a  screened Future Educations community and the Health and Fitness SLC now a screened Pre-Med SLC. While these  structural changes are meaningful in that they are a response to student interest, we also remember that we must  maintain a constant focus on instruction. In the past such a focus centered on meaningful engagement and rigor.  However, having made meaningful progress in those areas as indicated by the 2016-2017 Quality Review, our SY 17-18  focus on teacher feedback and its impact on student learning, along with the efforts to increase student efficacy, will  continue, and in SY 18-19 will be accompanied by an emphasis on differentiation.   Over the past four years the school has worked towards fully implementing the PBIS program, and now has  interventions and social-emotional supports for tier 1-tier 3 offenses, with those for tier 3 including an extensive wrap-  2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          41      around program supporting students with a myriad of support, academic as well as social-emotional. In response to data  and surveys to our "check in-check out" attendance monitoring program, which indicated that students did not  necessarily "check out" with their SLC director or a PBIS team member, in SY 18-19 we will be adapting the "Check and  Connect" program, which is built on developing mentor-student relationships rather than the more bureaucratic check  outs at a pre-determined time in the day. We also are beginning a restorative justice program and selected staff  members have received, and will continue receiving, training in restorative circles. stresses interaction between the  mentor and student    To ensure teachers plan for individual student needs, a system of pre-post monthly interim assessments was established  several years ago for the four core content areas as well as ENL classes; these assessments serve as one of the major  data points for department inquiry. Such inquiry conducted in SY 17-18 will lead to several revisions for the 2018-2019  school year, including an increased emphasis on assessing essay writing in ELA and Social Studies and an increasing focus  on content vocabulary in Social Studies classes to close the gap between student scores on ELA Regents essays vs Social  Studies Regents essays. Department inquiry also revealed students misled by distractors, particularly in multiple choice  questions, so strategies to support students in the recognition of this also will become a major focus of department  work. Given the increased emphasis on differentation in SY 18-19, developing strategies and tasks to provide all  students with multiple entry points will figure strongly.    During the 2017-2018 school year we participated in the CUNY PERC program in selected ninth grade Algebra and Living  Environment classes. Students acting as a TAS (Teaching Assistant Student) previously has passed the class and Regents,  but in the case of Math, scored below the level required for college readiness. By working as a TAS and with students  taking the class and Regents for the first time, they had the opportunity to strengthen their skills and retake the Regents  themselves, as well. The PERC program consists of two periods, one for sitting in on a ninth grade class and working as a  TAS, and the second as a planning class with other TAS students. This program will be continued and expanded in SY 18- 19, and a third period will be added for those TAS students who are identified as likely to benefit from an additional  Math class to further support their retaking of the Regents to achieve college readiness.   Students and parents indicate that the school has high expectations for test performance and graduation, which are  communicated by the teachers, guidance counselors, and SLC leaders. Regular newsletters, phone blasts, and progress  reports/report cards will continue to be sent home to keep parents abreast of school events and student progress. We  will continue to use the kinvolved text messaging program to notify parents in real time of absences, cutting, discipline,  or good news regarding their child. Two dedicated school counselors lead the effort in providing information to families  and formally supporting the application and transition process of preparing students for post-secondary study and  work., including workshops for parents on the application and financial aid processes. In SY 18-19 we will be in year two  of the three year College Access for All program, and all ninth grade students will participate in class introducing them to  college expectations and requirements, and resources and programs to assist them which they will grow increasingly  familiar with during their four years in high school.           How do you envision enhancing collaboration amongst your Instructional Leadership Team to improve teacher  practices and student learning?  The school instructional cabinet meets on a weekly basis to conduct inquiry regarding our own practices as well as that  of teachers, and of the impact of such practice on student learning and outcomes. Our focus for SY 17-18 was on the  implementation of our instructional focus on planning and instruction, and it is anticipated the focus will remain the  same in SY 18-19.    One aspect of the school culture is working within a school wide problem of practice, with each department then  analyzing its own work through the lens of a department based problem of practice which, if resolved, would contribute  to the resolution of the school wide problem. The problems of practice generated both at the school and department  levels are aligned with data points, district priorities, and the school's instructional focus, so that each team is working  towards the same solution, within the same framework but from its own particular perspective. At Leadership Team   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          42               meetings assistant principals present their departments' problem of practice and examine its relationship to the school  wide problem, with updates given throughout the course of the year; the same is done at the department levels.   In addition to its alignment with data, priorities, and the instructional focus, the problems of practice also are closely  aligned with the inquiry cycle, so that it becomes clear where and what learning gaps exist, what strategies and/or  structures have been introduced or revised to address them, what the impact of this has been, and what next steps  need to be taken, with the cycle then repeating. Throughout this process all instructional leaders are involved with  cabinet based instructional rounds, sharing of best practices, data analysis, student work analysis, etc, thus promoting  transparency and collaboration towards resolving the school wide problem of practice. By taking this work back to their  departments and aligning it with their own department based problem of practice, teachers as well as instructional  leaders are able to see school wide success and challenges and take advantage of numerous opportunities provided to  working together to address needed issues.   Instructional Leadership Team collaboration also is supported through practices such as norming, joint participating in  student focus groups designed to gain student insight into school wide strategies and initiatives, and department  intervisitations. All of this work will continue in SY 18-19.     How do you envision collaboration within teacher teams to improve teacher practices and student learning?  Our structure provides teachers regular opportunities to work together at department, grade level, and interdisciplinary  levels; this occurs during our common planning time periods which occur twice per week and alternate between  department and SLCs. The specific focus of the work done within a particular team depends on the type of team, ie,  content vs. interdisciplinary or grade level, but the work being done within all teams is related to the cycle of inquiry.  For example, content teams typically analyze monthly department assessments and other work within that content area  to identify student learning gaps (both the patterns of gaps and gaps for individual students), and identify specific  instructional strategies which can be used effectively to close them while SLC based teams focus on topics such as  student attendance.   During SY 17-18 the practice of department based intervisitations becaome embedded within the majority of core  content areas. These intervisitations typically consist of 3-4 teachers who visit another teacher to provide feedback on  their practice. A google based form allows teachers to log their visits, explain the feedback provided, and reflect on how  the visit may lead to changes in their own instruction. The areas of focus of these visits are aligned with the instructional  focus so typically are related to practice regarding assessment, rigor, engagement, feedback, or student revision.  Beginning in SY 18-19 a stronger focus also will be given to differentiation.   Other school structures supporting collaboration include PCT workshops, Model Teacher classrooms, and the UFT  Teacher Center. However, whether the framework is on a problem of practice as described above, intervisitations,  common planning time, PCT workshops , etc, all are conducted in alignment with data based need as reflected in the  district priorities and instructional focus, providing a common language and goal.     How do you envision collaboration across teacher teams to improve data driven teacher practices that result in  improvement in student achievement?     What data will teachers and the Instructional Leadership Team regularly review to ensure that they are reflecting upon  needed adjustments to teaching practices and meeting individual student learning needs?

Student work   Monitor student progress in targeted areas.             Describe the screening process you use to identify students who need extra help? How do you use this process to  determine which intervention to provide?  John Adams has an extensive internal data tracking system. Coupled with the New Visions portal it provides specific  information related to student progress, areas of need, and the impact of interventions, social-emotional as well as  academic. Major steps in this process include but are not limited to:   1.) Scheduled conferences to review the New Visions sorter and identify students needing support regarding  attendance, credit accumulation, and Regents passage. Targeted students are known to their teachers, SLC director, and  counselor, all of whom are responsible for providing periodic updates regarding progress and which interventions they  have to be effective.   2.) Monthly Regents based department assessments. These assessments are cumulative and in addition to including  new content each month also include questions based on what students had the most difficulty with on previous  assessments. During professional development and common planning time meetings departments analyze the data to  identify questions with which students had the most difficulty, and the skill and content those questions reflect. They  then develop alternate strategies for re-teaching and reviewing.   3.) Teacher facing unit trackers are developed by departments and used throughout the course of the unit to measure  student progress in skills and content being taught.    Interventions are determined based upon student need as determined by assessment and analysis of skill gaps.        Part 3 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools – Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be consistent with the  expectations in part 2, responsive to the identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART –  Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Meeting your SMART goal should directly impact  meeting at least one of your Rise Benchmarks.

Unlike past  years, in SY 18-19  teachers and students  also will be added to  these inquiry teams, so  that teachers whose  classes are visited as part  of this inquiry work may  receive feedback from  varying perspectives:  supervisory, peer within  same content, peer from  a different content area,  and students.  Professional  development will include  opportunities for teacher  reflection on creating  multiple entry access  points and developing  strategies for creating  and supporting  productive student  struggle.   PBIS will continue to be  used as the framework  for establishing and  explicitly teaching  universal understanding  of the expectations for  behavior and learning for  all staff and students,  and Tier III interventions,  piloted in SY16-17 will be  expanded as well.

Include the timeline and  identify key personnel responsible for implementation and oversight.  The school and CBO will seek input from the SLT, PA, and Parent Coordinator for best practices to engage parents in  their understanding of collaborative teachers and how the home and school together can collaborate to support  children at home and in school. The CBO will be take the lead in seeking input and following up, while the school will  provide information related to curricula, graduation requirements, etc. The tentative timeline is as follows:   August 2018: Orientation for incoming students and their families   September 2018: Community Night; Lead, CBO First SLT Meeting, Lead: SLT Chairperson First PA Meeting, Leads: PA  President, Parent Coordinator   October 2018-December 2018: Ongoing monthly SLT and PA meetings. CBO engages parent members to solicit  suggestions, select priorities, and implement. Principal and Assistant Principals provide information regarding school  goals and progress. CBO and Parent Coordinator develop workshops based on parental input. Small Learning  Communities provide opportunities for parents to meet with the SLC team and review student progress.   January 2019: The school and CBO analyze steps undertaken assess their impact, and revise as necessary.   February 2019-June 2019: TBD; plan dependent on results of January analysis.        Part 5 – Budget and Resource Alignment   Part 5a. Indicate resources you will leverage to achieve this annual goal and implement this action plan, including  human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, lead CBO’s community school budget, FSC Supports,  etc.  Resources leveraged include weekly AP Team meetings, department based common planning time, SLC based  common planning time, and weekly after school professional development. Additional resources include coaches  provided by the Office of School Renewal, the school based Peer Collaborative Teachers, and WITSI coaches to train  the AP's in WITSI.      Resources will also be directed in order to support our growing IB and STEM programs. These programs are grounded  in solid research practices and therefore must be supported with sufficient research tools such as laptops, desktop  computers, and printers. It is essential that these programs have the tools they need to succeed. The school also has  emerging Robotics and Virtual Enterprise programs that will both receive the financial resources they need to  continue their development. We are also improving on our school newspaper and purchasing an ADOBE program that  will allow for a more efficient newspaper layout and improved printing of the publication.      Additionally, this equipment will also be used to promote teacher collaboration through the use of Google Drive so  teachers can have share documents and work on lessons together while not in the same room. This system is also  used as a way to keep students up to date on all assignments in their classes as work can be shared via Google   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          48      applications. By teacher request we have purchased video cameras so that teachers can self assess and or seek peer  feedback to their lessons as part of the inter visitation program outlined above.      PBIS will be supported with resources such as staff professional development, prizes for monthly "Rack em Up  redemptions" and general supplies such as colored paper for "Rack em Up tickets." PBIS will also be implementing a  Restorative Justice program in which funding will be leveraged in order to train teachers in restorative practices and  time will be allocated for those that are trained to turnkey to the rest of the staff. As part of the Restorative Justice  program, the school will be building a court room in one of our classrooms in order to utilize a youth court.      Part 5b.

Similar to your Annual Goal, your mid-point benchmark should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and  Time-bound.  By February 2019 the Regents passing rate will be equal to at least ½ of the total required to be earned during School  Year 2018-2019 in order to meet the June 2019 Regents completion rate benchmark     Part 6b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress.  Progress towards passing the Regents will be determined through department monthly assessments and first  semester scholarship reports. The January 2019 Regents administration will assess our progress towards our June  goal.     Part 6c. In February 2019, review progress towards meeting the annual goal and make adjustments to the action  plan, if applicable.      2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          49      Section 5: Needs Assessment, Summative Vision, Annual Goals, and Action Plans      Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and  nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional  support that drives student achievement.

What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide,   Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review?   The school leader has strategically used programmatic, human, and fiscal resources to ensure evidence based systems  and practices to implement a vision and instructional/environmental focus. A system for review and evaluation of staff  instruction and practices has been established and implemented and during SY 16-17 administrators made significant  progress regarding the type of feedback provided to staff, as evidenced by the improvement in teacher feedback to  students. While John Adams did receive a preliminary rating of Proficient in component 1.2, Pedagogy, in the SY 16-17  Quality Review that same component was indicated as an Area of Focus. In SY 18-19 a continued focus will be placed not  only on feedback, impact, and student ownership, but on performance task alignment and productive student struggle  as well. Additionally, the student self efficacy component will be used to frame work undertaken during SY 18-19 in  support of differentiation and culturally responsive instruction. Past observation reports and instructional rounds  indicate that while not as prevalent as in the past, there still are pockets of instruction where the level of rigor does not  support a vision of college readiness. The school also recognizes the necessity to minimize the gap between credit  accumulation and Regents results.         Part 2 – Summative Vision for Effective School Leadership   What is your vision for effective school leadership at your school?   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          50      John Adams has moved significantly closer towards establishment of a school culture which recognizes that in order for  student learning to occur there must be adult learning, as well. Thus, my vision of effective school leadership is to  create, nurture, and maintain the conditions which best allow this to take place. While there are different components  to adult learning at Adams one of the basic building blocks has been the inquiry process: what is it our students need to  know, what do they actually know, what can we do to close the gap, and is what we are doing having an impact. By  embedding a variation of the inquiry process into all phases of school life, attendance and social-emotional as well as  academic, the school is aware of and can address obstacles to learning and develop "next steps" towards full  implementation of our instructional focus.   In order to achieve this, though, certain prerequisites are necessary, such as articulation of a clear instructional focus  accompanied with constant communication regarding the focus itself as well as where school data stands in relation to  it. At John Adams the practice has been, and will continue to be, relating all decisions, meeting outcomes, professional  development, classroom visits, budgetary and programming decisions, etc, to how they help us achieve the goals fo our  focus. By doing so school leadership communicates common goals and objectives as well as a common language.    Practical implementation of this takes many forms. Common examples include reviewing data and observations to link  the strongest teachers with the neediest students, and to create professional development opportunities which address  the needs both of developing and the most effective teachers. Effective team teaching pairs must be created, and  programming must be based on the needs of individual students, not adults; considerations such as college readiness  and college preparatory classes also must be taken into account. Teacher observations are meaningless if they don’t  result in improved instruction and student learning outcomes, and it is vital that teacher progress towards meeting their  own professionally based, individual goals be monitored. For this reason assistant principals will consult with teachers to  establish goals based on the Danielson rubric, along with an action plan and benchmarks designed to help achieve those  goals.   The state DTSDE report, conducted in SY 13-14, recognized that Tenet 2, School Leader Practices and Decisions, are  largely effective, the SY 16-17 Quality Review rated the school "Well Developed" both in 4.1, Teacher Support and  Supervision and 4.2, Teacher Teams and Leadership Development. These, too, represent essential beliefs of school  leadership, with one of our main goals being to build upon, assess, and revise when necessary our structures and  instrutional program, with examples including attendance monitoring, monthly Regents based pre-assessments, the use  PBIS data to develop a Restorative Justice program for SY 18-19, writing inquiry, and parent outreach. Based on data  from SY 17-18, new SY 18-19 benchmarks will be established to monitor progress towards our goals in each of these  areas. This progress monitoring will continue to be a key feature of inquiry work conducted by each staff member, who  will continue to be supported by administration and PCTs.in this work through twice weekly Inquiry Day meetings, led  by WITSI trained APs and/or teachers. Staff members such as directors and PCTs conducting joint inquiry will be one key  step towards continuing to further collaboration; another step towards collaboration has been staffing the UFT Center  with a John Adams teacher trained in WIT. Additionally, during SY 18-19 the UFT Center will continue to offer  workshops, both in conjunction with, and separate from, the workshops and PD offered through our PCT led  Professional Learning Series.           What are your core belief(s) for school improvement and how they inform your vision for developing instructional  leadership at your school?  School improvement cannot occur in a vacuum nor can it involve a single, or even a small group, of people. My core  beliefs for school improvement center on:   1.) The creation and communication of a strong, data based instructional focus.   2.) Use of the inquiry cycle to identify learning gaps and monitor progress.   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          51                3.) The development of teacher leadership to help further implementation of the focus.   4.) Building wide collaboration   5.) The creation and maintenance of strong family and community ties.   6.) Input from all members of the school community.   Jointly, these individual components develop instructional leadership at the administrative, department, and classroom  levels by:   1.) Centering planning and instruction on data based student need and learning gaps.   2.) Creating a common understanding of school goals and objectives.   3.) Furthering adult learning.   4.) Developing the ability to identify the impact of school initiatives and pedagogical strategies.   5.) While not directly tied to instructional leadership, the components support closer ties between the school, family,  and community and strengthen student self-efficacy.     What is your vision for developing differentiated leadership throughout your school? How will you utilize teacher  leaders to build broad capacity within your school?   The school has created numerous opportunities for teacher leadership. Each of our small learning communities is led  not by an administrator but rather by a teacher leader referred to as a director. The director, along with the SLC specific  guidance counselor and dean, form a triad of SLC leadership. Inquiry at each grade level within each SLC is led by a  teacher, as well. Our PCT (Peer Collaborative Teacher) services our UFT Teacher Center and other teachers serve on our  IB (International Baccalaureate), attendance, and PBIS (Positive Behavior Interventions and Support) teams. Teacher  teams also have been sent for extensive training in the Engage curricula and in the WITSI (Writing is Thinking and  Strategic Inquiry) program. Staff also has the opportunity to participate in CLASS , a school improvement/leadership  program offered through Baruch College. John Adams received a preliminary rating of Well Developed in the SY 16-17  Quality Review for several components related to effective school leadership, particularly as it relates to evidence based  systems and leadership development, including 4.1, Support and Supervision, 4.2, Teams and Leadership Development,  and 5.1, Monitoring and Revising Systems.     How will the leader foster collaborative school governance processes, and ensure full family participation together  with other stakeholders?  Collaborative school governance occurs both through formal and informal structures. Formal structures include regular  meetings of the School Leadership Team, Renewal Committee, UFT Consultative Council, PTA, Academic Policy  Committee, SLC Leadership Teams, the School Safety Committee, Student Government, the PBIS and WIT teams, and  the Professional Development Committee, among others. Informal processes include input provided during common  planning time, professional development, and faculty and department conferences. Our CBO and Parent Coordinator  work together to review parent participation at past events and create an interest survey to plan relevant PA meetings  and parent workshops. In SY 18-19 the school and CBO have identified several strategies to further ensure family   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          52         participation. These include expanding the role of the CBO representative to the SLT so that he/she will work with  parent members on implementation of their ideas and conducting family focus groups.     How will you use evidence-based systems to ensure school and teacher leaders are led by a cycle of continuous  learning and use this to inform their teams’ priorities?

APs, teachers, PCT, ORS coaches,    Department professional development;  OSR coaches   APs, teachers, students, ORS coaches   Departments and individual teachers  will review data and implement the  inquiry cycle to determine the impact  of instructional strategies.   Observation reports will be used to  assess the quality of administrator's  feedback to teachers, while student  work and focus groups will measure  the specificity of teacher feedback to  students, students' ability to describe  their individual learning goals, and  students' ability to explain what they  are doing to meet their goals.         Part 3 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools – Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be consistent with the  expectations in part 2, responsive to the identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART –  Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound.

Summarize your school’s strengths relative to this element of the Framework for Great Schools and the SOPs   selected above.   2.  Summarize your school’s needs relative to this element of the Framework for Great Schools and the SOPs   selected above.  Identify the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this section.   3.  4.  What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide,   Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review?   Strong family and community ties can take place in a variety of ways and do not necessarily mean parents being  physically present in the building. One task the school has set before itself is to expand the ways family communication  has taken place, so that parents may receive frequent and timely information about their childrens' performance and  school events. The parent coordinator has reached out to community stakeholders as well as corporations such as AOL,  which conducted several workshops on resume writing and interview skills. The use of Kinvolved has greatly expanded  contact between school and home, with over 250,000 messages sent and received in SY 17-18. The school has an  extensive website and in addition to Kinvolved makes regular use of Twitter, email, mailings and phone calls to keep  parents informed. School leadership, the SLT, and PA have met with Global Kids, our CBO, to expand options and  strategies for outreach for SY 18-19. Suggestions made at these meetings include creation of a parent engagement  spreadsheet to better track the types of workshops and meetings which generate parental interest; a parent focus  group to gain insight regarding what the school does well in the area of family engagement and which need to be  revised; seeking parent volunteers at after school student events, and establishing monthly priorities to focus on in  service of achieving our June goals. Despite the need to continue to focus on family and community engagement, there  are strong indicators of progress. For example, the School Open House held in the spring of 2018 showed an increase of  200 parents over the previous year, and our SY 18-19 register has increased by approximately 200 students.   A priority need for 2018-2019 is to continue to build the relationships between the school, home, and community,  particularly in informing parents of the importance of college and career readiness. While this may be somewhat  atypical of goals related to family engagement, it was selected in recognition of the fact that while parent awareness of   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          58      the need for regular attendance in order to graduate has been addressed, there is a lack of alignment between  graduation and college readiness rates.        Part 2 – Summative Vision for Strong Family and Community Ties   What is your vision for strong family and community ties at your school?  What opportunities exist for the school staff  to know the students and their families in order to better communicate and partner with families and communities in  the vision for the school?  All entering parents and visitors are sent to the Welcome Center where parents have space to discuss concerns and  issues with the Parent Coordinator. The parent coordinator helps resolve these issues along with providing any  additional resource necessary and translators are available on an as needed basis. We have scheduled ongoing and  systematic events to encourage and sustain parent involvement. These include: informational nights, new student  orientation, open-house, college fairs, student recognition nights, sports events, NHS induction, shows and plays. In  addition to the PA and parent workshops, parents also are represented on the SLT, School Safety Committee, and  Renewal School Committee. If the parent is visiting to meet with someone else (i.e. admissions office, attendance office  or Guidance Counselor) they are typically escorted to that office by the Parent Coordinator. School safety officers and all  other staff members will continue to be provided with specialized professional development in how to greet parents in a  welcoming manner, and work with them in addressing their concerns in a manner that reflects a sincere professional  desire/interest. The school wide PBIS model, particularly our goal of “Be Welcoming” provides an important framework  for this work.   At the start of the school year all families receive a contact letter and email from the Parent Coordinator introducing  herself and describing how she can assist them. This letter also contains all school contact information, and is posted on  the school website. In addition, a Parent Handbook containing graduation requirements, information about the  Common Core, programming options, etc, is distributed. Parents new to the school are invited to a “Meet John Adams  Night”, with translation services provided. Personal phone calls are made to invite parents to monthly PA meetings to  discuss school news, family nights to educate parents about school policies and curriculum, parent teacher conference  to for staff and parents to discuss student’s performances. The school website also contains a syllabus for the core  content areas, along with explanatory notes. Additional outreach is provided by guidance counselors and Small Learning  Community directors, who initiate phone calls and log parent outreach on Skedula, the PBIS platform, and ILOG. The  college readiness index will be used as a measure of effectiveness for ensuring students and their families are aware of  college requirements and staff set high expectations for student performance throughout the year. Parent involvement  in workshops and activities, and open communication with school staff will ensure students are optimally prepared for  post-secondary success. The increased college readiness index will indicate that more families are aware of college and  career readiness requirements and opportunities and that students are prepared to meet or exceed the college  readiness index take advantage of post-secondary opportunities.   In order to ensure that all teachers engage parent outreach we have a standardized and uniform time each week for  that to be conducted; this is in addition to outreach conducted through other tools such as Kinvolved or the AIDP team.  Teachers use this 40 mins. on one or more of the following parent engagement activities: face-to-face meetings, phone  calls, written correspondence including emails, or creating newsletters and or preparing report cards. During common  planning time counselors, directors, and classroom teachers target students for outreach. Typically students are  targeted on the basis of attendance, discipline, or academic issues, allowing the school the opportunity to gain insight  from the family about each individual child. It is anticipated that our CBO, Global Kids, will be continue to extend this  outreach, as well.      One of Global Kids prime responsibilities is to conduct outreach to families and encourage more direct communication  between the school and home. Both the CBO, College Office and Parent Coordinator will have large office spaces   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          59      designed as family welcome centers. A school generated survey, suggested by the parent representatives on the SLT,  will be designed to provide us with more information about parent concerns and areas of interest.   In order to provide increased family access to student data the majority of our teachers utilize Skedula. In the past the  PA and Parent Coordinator have requested assistant principals to speak with parents at PA meetings regarding  graduation requirements in their specific subject areas, and it is expected that will continue in 2017-2018. At these  meetings guidance counselors address overall graduation requirements, and parents also are introduced to programs  such as Kinvolved, Skedula, and Naviance. In order to increase teacher accountability, at regular intervals during the  year teachers, directors, and counselors provide documentation regarding the types and amount of family outreach  conducted. A parents' newsletter is sent home three times per year, and the school website contains links regarding  graduation requirements, parent resources, and contacting school staff members.          Within the Community School model, how will families be welcomed into the school and made a part of the school  community?  What support will administrators, teachers, school staff and school safety officers be given to help create  a welcoming environment?   Will there be a dedicated space for families in the school?  Global Kids, the lead CBO, will continue to facilitate professional development in this area and invite school staff,  including school safety, to workshops on the creation of a caring school community. This will help to build the shared  responsibility and vision of identifying and developing leaders out of school’s families. In School Year 2017-2018, the  SLC’s, the ENL and ISS Department will also have their own family nights. The lead CBO will work with SLC Directors and  be present during these events to identify potential leaders as well. We will encourage families to become involved with  the Community School team and co-lead events such as Family Night and the Community School Forum with families as  well. Lastly, families will always have access to the Global Kids and Parent Coordinator offices for meetings, planning  purposes and community building.     How will the school identify and develop families to take leadership roles in school decision making/school governance  structures?  The school identifies families to take leadership roles through surveys given at PTA meetings, workshops, parent teacher  conferences and other school events. Parents are involved in school decision making on the school leadership team, at  school safety meetings and as a part of the school renewal school team. Parents are also chosen to sit on C30's and sit  on panels for the Quality Review.    Over the summer, the lead CBO will coordinate events for the families and professional development sessions for  available school staff regarding the pillars of a community school. Parents who participate in summer events will be  identified as potential leaders for the School Leadership Team and the Community School Team.            How will the school engage the community and families? How will they ensure that teachers are able to learn from  families about the children being taught?  The school engages the community and families at Parent Teacher Conferences, Informational sessions and PTA  meetings. Teachers are required to do parental outreach to develop a strong relationship with families on a weekly  basis.    As mentioned above, the ongoing events that the SLCs will be coordinating will facilitate a mutual learning process by  which school staff and families can learn from another in how best to support the students academically, socially and  emotionally. The Community School Team will include teachers, students, community partners and family members,  which will provide another avenue from which relationships can develop and build capacity. Lastly, the Office of  Community Schools provides each site with an Outreach Specialist, who we will utilize as a resource for leadership  development with families and parents who want to become more engaged with the school. In regard to community  partnerships, we will continue to subcontract partners to conduct workshop series with our families and other   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          60            community members that will teach computer skills and job readiness. We would like to expand the curriculum  repertoire by adding topics such as health and wellness.     How do families partner with the school and CBO to support student success?  Will there be dedicated space for  families?    Family partnerships with  school:   Parents will be invited to an SLC informational night to have a better understanding  of what SLC their child is a part of and what supports that SLC has for the students  and families. An orientation is held every September before the school year begins  for all new students and families to understand our expectations and goals for the  upcoming year. This is also a perfect way for us to welcome everyone into the John  Adam's family and letting them know what supports we have for them.   Family partnerships with CBO:      Global Kids will play a critical part at every informational session we have for families  to explain what a community school is and how it benefits the families. Some of the  resources they will be speaking about is tutoring, counseling and attendance  initiatives. They will be spearheading the family night in September and the  Community school forum in May letting families know what our expectations are  and how much progress we made towards our goals.      Is there dedicated space for  these partnerships?   The Parent Coordinator's office is opened to all families and community members.

ELT provides enriching  educational experiences that happen outside of the traditional school day and blend skill acquisition, relationship- building and fun to foster academic and social-emotional growth. Summer learning, afterschool programming, and  extended-day ELT models, when well-implemented, play a critical role in supporting students in all grades and ensuring  that they graduate from high school, college and career ready. SED requires that Priority schools offer a minimum of 200  additional student contact hours as Expanded Learning Time in addition to the current mandated length of 900 hours of  instruction per year (25 hours per week) in grades K-6 and 990 hours of instruction per year (27.5 hours per week) in  grades 7-12. Effective ELT models will blend school staff with community partners, and will provide a balanced  curriculum that can include ELA, math, STEM, arts, physical activity, and leadership development. Complete the sections  on this page to demonstrate how the school will meet these requirements.    Part 1 – ELT Program Goal(s)   Describe the summative goal(s) of the ELT program for the 2018-19 school year. Goals for ELT should aligned to the  Rise Benchmarks.  How will the school will ensure that all students’ individual needs are served during the Rise ELT  and how the school’s vision for ELT will impact both academic achievement and social emotional growth? Be sure to  construct the goal to be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.  By June 2019, the goal of the ELT program is to provide student academic, social, and emotional supports, as  indicated by reaching our benchmarks of a Regents completion rate of 55.1%, 4 year college readiness index of 38.2%,  and college and career preparatory course index rate of 43.3%/        Part 2 – ELT Program Type   Is the ELT program voluntary or compulsory?      Voluntary   X   Compulsory   Rise ELT – Describe what accountability structures the school will employ to ensure participation of all students,  including special populations, will participate fully in Rise ELT.  Additional ELT - If there is a voluntary ELT program in addition to the compulsory Rise ELT, indicate how you will  actively encourage the participation of all students, with the goal of serving at least 50% of students.  We currently do not have a voluntary ELT program.        Part 3 – ELT Program Description   Target Population: The ELT program for a Rise School will be offered to all students in the school.   Describe how the school will meet the following SED requirements for an ELT program:  How will the school integrate academics, enrichment, and skill development through hands-on experiences that make  learning relevant and engaging?    How will CBO staff and the school’s teachers be integrated to provide a seamless learning day?     Offer a range of activities that capture student interest and strengthen student engagement in learning so as   to promote higher attendance, reduces risk for retention or drop out, and increases the likelihood of  graduation.     Actively address the unique learning needs and interests of all types of students, especially those who may   benefit from approaches and experiences not offered in the traditional classroom setting.     What new content areas and opportunities will be offered to students? How will the school ensure all IEP and   language mandates are met during ELT?     Contain components designed to improve student academic, social, and emotional outcomes, including   opportunities for enrichment programs such as in music and art.     Ensure instruction in any core academic subject offered in the program will be delivered under the   supervision of a teacher who is NYS certified in that particular content area.   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          66        How will community educators receive professional development?  Are there plans to provide joint PD to   school faculty and community partner staff?     What content will be led by pedagogical staff and what content will be led by CBO partners?    How will the school best utilize CBO partners to impact student achievement?    How will effective outreach be conducted to families?    How will programming be made easily accessible to students and families in order to encourage   participation?   Students become disengaged from school and learning for a variety of reasons, such as unaddressed skill deficiencies,  too much or too little academic challenge, or what they see as a lack of relevancy between what they learn in the  classroom and their lives outside of school. Extended learning time is an opportunity to address and resolve these  issues through a menu of activities which engage and support their learning.   We have designed a menu of ELT options targeted to the needs, skills, and interests of all students in the building.  Some of these options will address the development of skills, particularly literacy and numerical, which will be  conducted through a framework designed to provide multiple entry points; some of the strategies to be used include  Reading Horizons and/or Achieve 3000; the incorporation of art inclusive strategies introduced this year by Urban  Arts; and blended learning. There will be a blended learning program as well as a strong emphasis on college planning  and awareness, supported by use of the Naviance program and classes such as College Writing, SAT prep, and Project  Based Learning. Other options will include College Now and Jr. Airforce ROTC. In order to improve student academic,  emotional, and social outcomes our CBO, Global Kids, will provide attendance and push in supports, as well as an  internship program offered through our partnership with JetBlue, transition to high school support classes, service  based learning, a theater project, and a technology program offered in conjunction with Co-Op Tech. Students will be  programmed for the most appropriate class/program on an individual basis, taking into account factors such as their  attendance record, progress towards graduation, 8th grade ELA/Math scores, and areas of need and interest.   Our ELT will continue to be incorporated into the regular school day. As a Rise School we are mandated to program  every student for ELT and although we will receive funding to support the hiring of teachers for ELT time it is possible  that there will be a shortage, as not every teacher in the building will necessarily be interested in working an extra  hour each day. We have created a posting for ELT are willing to hire teachers from other schools for ELT and have  brought up our concerns with our CBO. However, it should be noted that while a shortage of teachers is a possibility it  has not occurred in the past, and at this point in time it is not anticipated it will be problematic in SY 18-19.   One specific example of the way in which ELT is utilized differently than regular instructional time is through the  enrollment of students in Think Through Math. Ninth grade students enrolled in MES41-42 and MES43-44 blocks for  the school year, with fulfillment of the purpose of ELT, will participate in the Think Through Math online learning  program. Resources will be used to further PD and coaching for teachers. Students enrolled in the program will use it  in the classroom for 1-2 periods over each 10 period stretch. Students will take 3 benchmark exams for the year.  Teachers will collaborate to create online pathways for groups of students. The pathway used could be the NYS  Regents Pathway or one constructed by teachers in accordance to intervention/needs identified by common monthly  assessment data.    Staff training for maximizing the effectiveness of ELT time takes place in various venues, depending on the nature of  the program. For example, teachers of those classes designed to support students academically, so that they pass a  Regents exam or earn a required credit, benefit from the types of professional development outlined in other  sections of this RCEP. Teachers of these classes also benefit from their own participation in common planning time  activities such as targeted attendance inquiry, or from such inquiry conducted by others in the building, such as the  Attendance Team or SAM cohort, as well as by coaches provided by the Office of School Renewal. Other ELT classes,  such as those offering enrichment activities to on-track or advanced students, are aligned with the requirements of  their respective programs and/or supporting institutions, ie, JROTC, York College, Queensborough Community  College, etc, while those enrolled with more learning deficiencies and programmed for ELT classes such as Reading  Horizons, are supported by the AP ISS and other forms of professional development.   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          67      In addition to the ELT classes embedded in our regular school day and in which all students participate we also  provide, with the support of our CBO, both credit bearing and Regents review classes through our Saturday program.  After school programs, primarily enrichment activities, are offered through the Urban Arts program.   Family outreach will be conducted through a series of channels, including posting information on our school website,  phone calls to the home, advising parents of it at PA meetings, incorporation of ELT information into our school  newsletter sent to the home, and social media such as Twitter.        Part 4 – ELT Program Implementation and Oversight  Part 4a. Who will implement the ELT program? Who will oversee the program?  1.   Indicate the key personnel that will be responsible for implementing and overseeing the ELT program,  including school-based staff and any high-quality community partners that will be involved.  If applicable, describe the scope of involvement of all community partners and how the joint ELT program is  structured.  How will the school assess the impact of ELT on individual student achievement and social emotional  development?     2.   3.   The ELT program will be implemented and overseen by the Community School Director and Principal, supported by  Assistant Principals and the School Renewal Team. Other key personnel will include guidance counselors and Small  Learning Community directors. ELT will be provided through the framework of the regular school day, through the  addition of an extra period to student programs. The program’s impact and success will be monitored and evaluated  through data points such as attendance, dean referrals, results of monthly Regents pre-assessments, and student  scholarship, in order to determine whether movement is being made towards achieving benchmarks.     Part 4b. Timeline for implementation and completion, including start and end dates.

Further  description is below.   September-October 2018: Department APs, the SAM cohort, and Inquiry leaders will review data with content area  teachers to identify skill/content gaps. Guidance counselors and Small Learning Community directors will meet with  students to explain the purpose of ELT in general, and their particular ELT program in particular. The Parent  Coordinator and CBO will reach out to parents and message the benefits of ELT, particularly its academic supports  and/or the opportunity to develop college readiness. Inquiry teams will create parameters and select students  targeted for attendance and academic inquiry. Content area assistant principals will meet with teachers to develop  goals for all classes, including ELT. Saturday credit bearing courses will start, and the CBO will plan for the start of  Regents review classes later in the semester. The CBO also will target students for attendance/academic/social- emotional supports. Progress of all targeted students will be monitored at weekly meetings, with the overall progress  of ELT monitored bimonthly.   November 2018: Data such as attendance, internal monthly assessments, and marking period grades will be  monitored to assess progress towards graduation and Regents completion rates. Additional supports will be elicited  as necessary, and may include OSR coaches, attendance supports, secondary CBOs, counseling, etc. Saturday Regents  review classes will begin.   December 2018-January 2019: The impact of ELT will be assessed through the data points discussed above.

Inquiry teams will analyze the impact of ELT and outreach and determine next  steps. Counselors will meet with students to review progress.   February 2019: The spring semester begins.   March-May 2019: Barring the need for additional revisions, at this point in time it is expected that this timeframe will  align with much of the outline above.   June 2019: Final assessment and determination of next steps.        Part 5 – ELT Budget and Resource Alignment   Part 5a. Indicate resources needed including human resources, instructional resources, and schedule adjustments to  implement the ELT program.  A number of Assistant Principals and the Principal will work ELT in order to ensure the necessary support for the  programs. Teachers will work on a staggered schedule in order to account for the extra learning time.   Resources such as Reading Horizons, the Gates-Mcginnity test and Think Through Math Curriculum will be purchased  in order to support classroom instruction, curriculums, and provide assessment data.     Part 5b. Indicate using an “X” the fund source(s) that will be utilized to support the ELT Program.   Note: If the program is funded by 21st Century Community Center Learning Funds, it must be offered in conjunction  with a high quality, high capacity community partner.

Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement  planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal.  Similar to your Annual Goal, your mid-point benchmark should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and  Time-bound.  Mid-point benchmarks: By February 2019 credit accumulation and Regents completion rates will be midway towards  meeting the June benchmarks.     Part 6b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress.  Progress will be monitored through first semester student scholarship (ie, credit accumulation) and Regents reports.      Part 6c. In February 2019, review progress towards meeting the annual goal and make adjustments to the action  plan, if applicable.      2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          69      Section 7: Community School Description    Directions: The Community School strategy is directly aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. Community Schools  bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and family  engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in  Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health &  Wellness.    Part 1 – The Community School Program Goal(s)   How is the Community School strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it  had on student academic outcomes?  Over the past few years the integration of the Community School strategy and academic instruction has grown  stronger. While the 2017-2018 school year evidenced the strongest integration to date, we fully expect it to  strengthen even more during SY 18-19. The integration is represented in numerous ways, with some examples  including:   1.) CBO attendance outreach and home visits to targeted students.   2.) CBO support for tutoring and remedial programs.   3.) The CBO conducts after school activities for students, allowing them to feel more supported and welcomed in the  school.   4.) Student mentoring is conducted by the CBO.   5.) The CBO provides a "second set of eyes" on students targeted for credit accumulation and Regents exams, and  follows up with home visits/one-on-one or small group discussions/mentoring/tutoring, as necessary.    6.) The CBO provides incentives to students for academic and/or attendance goal meeting and improvements.     Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School program for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct  the goal to be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.   By June 2019, the schools Community Based Organization will collaborate with school leaders to meet an attendance  goal of 88%.          Please answer the following question as it relates to meeting your Community School Program Annual Goal(s):  How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in ELT, Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health &  Wellness--support your academic goals for students?  The Community School goals represent preconditions necessary for learning to occur. By meeting these goals we will  be ensuring that students are in a safe and supportive environment, which can be viewed as the social-emotional  version of an environment conducive to learning.        Part 2 – Community School Program Description   Part 2a. Identify the CBO partnerships that you will develop in ELT, Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and  Health & Wellness, their target student population(s), and scope of the services provided. As well as supporting  schools’ supportive environment and attendance work, CBOs should be helping to support your school’s instructional  focus.

Targeted AIS students   Tutoring   All students   Enrichment activities   Part 2b. Describe how the school will partner with the Lead CBO to do the following:  1.   Community Schools are expected to partner with a community-based partner organization (CBO) and  together with members of the School Leadership Team, hire a Community School Director. The Director will  lead implementation of the asset and needs assessment process, and other critically important coordinating  activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work.  Community Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and  services, as determined by the asset and needs assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time  (ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the  right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly  coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day.  Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to  strengthen this initiative.  Community Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and  families feel welcome, actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of  their schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community  School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this family engagement  strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work.  Community School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director,  select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual  students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use.  Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work.   2.   3.   4.   Having a CBO partner widens our reach and impact with students, as well as helps the school to expand its reach in  bringing in community stakeholders. The school will continue to leverage the role of the Community School Director  (CSD) in support of our annual goal by incorporating the CSD into the appropriate structures of the school that  address chronic absenteeism, meaningful academic engagement and rigor, and mental health/social-emotional  wellness. This effort will be newly expanded with such activities and structures as: weekly AP meetings, SLT meetings,  PBIS meetings, PPT meetings and parent engagement meetings. The school will also help to leverage the CSD’s role by  working with him/her to create an Attendance Team and the Community School Team. Additionally, we will support  the CSD in creating a more expansive partnership between the parent coordinator, PA president, AP Guidance, SLT,  CET, and PBIS team with the intention of not only boosting parent engagement but providing parents and families  with support in how to more meaningfully and transformatively engage with the school. This will include creating  more resources within the school building that parents can take advantage of (financial literacy courses, parenting  workshops, English language learning, computer skills, etc), as well as working with the Outreach Specialist from the  Office of Community Schools to create a stronger structure in how parent leaders can be developed and therefore  included in the school’s decision-making process.   In regards to creating stronger community relations, the school will support the CSD/lead CBO in coordinating and  creating activities and events that will draw stakeholders to become more involved with the school and the success of  the students. Such events will include, for example, the monthly forums that will take place in the school, where  community members, students and families will have the opportunity to voice concerns and express what needs both  within and beyond the school campus need to be addressed. The CBO will also facilitate ongoing workshop  opportunities for on-board stakeholders, so as to create a space where they can brainstorm how to develop their  respective relationships with the school community.   CBO after school programming will further the Community School Initiative by offering programs that focus on youth  development, positive peer-to-peer and peer-to-teacher interactions, global awareness, civic engagement, and   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          71      mental/physical well-being, while engaging community stakeholders to help improve the community through projects  that have tangible results. Through the CBO after school programs, all students will have the opportunity to have  engaging discussions on issues within their community, connecting those issues with the larger context of how to be  an active and engaged citizen, and how to take action on issues they see. Also, students will have the opportunity to  create real change within their community via weekly community service projects, internships, college and career  readiness courses, activism through art, therapeutic writing courses, and developing tangible skills related to  information technology and media literacy. The programs are offered to all students and touch on multiple topics that  will increase student engagement across a broad range of students within the school.   The CBO will rely on existing partnerships as well as reach out to new partners to implement the aspects of the  Partnership Schools program. The school has already established a relationship with the Parent Coordinator, and will  continue to host, plan, and execute events that provide parents with the opportunity to become more involved with  the school. To do this the CBO we will create a parent survey that outlines services offered by the school currently,  and what services parents would like to see the school offer. This survey will be translated into Bengali, Spanish,  Arabic, and Haitian Creole (the five main languages of the school, outside of English) to make sure we reach all the  parents and can include input from them regardless of language to better serve, and represent, the demographics  within the school. We will also offer free programs for parents (like tax preparation, ENL, and GED) so that they  themselves can be a part of the John Adams educational initiative. This has, and will, be done in consultation with the  Outreach Specialist from the Office of Community Schools and the Parent Coordinator at John Adams HS.   The CSD will develop a partnership with the PBIS team and the PPT in order to add to and strengthen the resources  offered for students across all Tiers, and will continue working closely with these two structures throughout the year.  It has been determined that Global Kids will be offered as a Tier 1 and Tier 2 intervention, and will work alongside the  PBIS Coordinator in developing the Youth Court structure. Moreover, the CSD will also take regular part in meeting  with the attendance team and utilize the New Visions student sorter database to accordingly address the issue of  chronic absenteeism          Part 3 – Community School Partnerships Oversight   Part 3a. Key Staff and Partners  1.  Name and describe the scope of involvement of all community partners working in the school (include partners   supporting ELT, counseling, enrichment, etc.)   2.  Name the members of your Community School Team and how meetings will be organized and structured to   engage all stakeholders and be focused on results.   3.  Explain data strategies including the use of the data sorter, and steps that the school will take to ensure that the   appropriate interventions are provided to the right students   The Community School program at John Adams High School will be overseen by the Office of School Renewal, the  principal and our CBO, Global Kids, working together with the SLT and School Renewal Team. Essential school staff  include the Parent Coordinator, the PTA President and the school’s teaching and guidance staff. Overseeing health  and mental health aspects of the program include key personnel from an on-site health center comprised mostly of  clinicians and social workers. North Shore Long Island Jewish Health Clinic operates on the John Adams High School  campus to provide community access to both health and mental health services. The Community School Director will  strategically assess ongoing outcomes by ensuring that academic performance is elevated. Partnerships among the  principal, students, parents, school faculty, and neighborhood stakeholders are paramount. The Director will play a  valuable role in aligning positive communication, planning and resources. The Community School Director will work  alongside the Principal or the Principal’s designee and the school leadership team to manage resources and  document demonstrated impact on student based outcomes. We will meet each week to discuss progress, impact  and areas of need. Other key Community school staff include: youth advocates, the Family Engagement worker, the  Office Manager, counselors/interns, group leaders and the data analysis worker.   The ELT component of the Community School will focus on academic enrichment courses. College Now courses will  be provided through a linkage with CUNY-York College. CUNY will support ELT services for the students who are not   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          72      on track for graduation by offering remedial level non-credit-bearing courses. CUNY will hire 3--4 teachers to host the  ELT classes. Subject areas taught by John Adams High School instructors include English, Science, Social Studies and  Math teachers.    CBO Global Kids will evaluate the success of the Community School utilizing report cards, attendance data, and parent  surveys. All measurable metrics will also be assessed to understand specific goal achievement. The Community School  planning team will re-evaluate impact and strategy success at least 3-4 times during the school year. All aspects of  programming will be reviewed, including mental health service, academic improvement, parent involvement,  partnership development and the service learning community development.     Part 3b. Indicate resources needed including human resources, instructional resources, and schedule adjustments to  implement the Community School program.  A number of factors influence and mobilize the resources and assets of a school and community to improve  educational, health, social, and related results. Moreover, the effort will account for the fact that Community Schools  are focused on influencing a variety of related objectives: supporting student achievement, creating more  opportunities for children and ensuring that schools are safe, healthy and supporting places to nurture learning and  engagement.   In order for students at John Adams High School to receive free health care through the school’s new school-based  health center, funding and staff will need to continue to be provided by Cohen Children’s Medical Center and the  North Shore-LIJ Health System. This free on-site health center provides more than 2,500 students at John Adams with  access to nurse practitioners, social workers, a psychiatrist, pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease (STD)  prevention programs and vaccinations. The full service medical center also provides treatment for asthma, diabetes  and mental health; full laboratory services; physicals for sports, working papers and college applications; and diet and  exercise plans for students with weight management concerns.   The CBO will use certified teaching staff for enrichment programs. Most, teaching staff for after-school ELT programs  are contractually obligated to remain for the duration of the program. Per session advertisements for high needs  subject areas, such as math, will be made based on the number of students flagged for being under-credited or in  need of a Regents exam. Schedule and program needs and adjustments will be completed in collaboration with the  program office and in consultation with the school leadership team.   Core resources needed to provide services include:     Dedicated Community School Director: The school has one dedicated staff role focused on assessing school   and student need, securing resources, and coordinating services across students, families and the school  community. The Director is employed by the lead CBO partner and serves as key partner to the principal and  other senior leaders at the school.     Ongoing Needs Assessment: The school (and CBO partner) will conduct an annual needs assessment of all  enrolled students to determine their academic, health, social, and emotional needs. Every three years, the  school also conducts a community-level needs assessment, which should engage all relevant local  stakeholders.     Defined Community Partnerships: A fully-developed Community School not only has established partnerships,      but those partnerships are formalized in Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) and linkage agreements.  Intentional Coordination of Services: John Adams Community School has a clearly defined strategy for  properly identifying the needs of their students and school community, and a plan for securing the resources  and services to meet those identified needs. These resources begin in the classroom as our classrooms are  equipped with both SmartBoards and computers connect individual students to tailored resources based on  their needs.      Strategic Data Collection & Analysis: Data will inform program decisions and clearly aligned outcomes should  flow directly from the school’s needs. School and student goals, and the school’s progress towards achieving   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          73         those goals, should be regularly shared among all school partners through data inquiry and collaborative data  review     Part 3c. Timeline for implementation and completion, including start and end dates.

These  assessments served  to measure student  reading ability and  provide LexileR  reader measures to  help guide future  reading and monitor  growth in the  student's ability. The  progress-monitoring  tests have been  developed for four  levels of reading  comprehension. Each  level corresponds to  the approximate  reading ability based  on grade level norms;  Grades 1-3, Grades4- 5, Grades 6-8 and  Grades 9-12. Content  of the items are  appropriate for  students in Grades 4- 12/Adult. For each  level, three  equivalent forms  have been developed  for administration  throughout the year.  Each progress  monitoring form  consists of 34 items.  The items on the test  are targeted based  on the LexileR  measure of the  passages.   - Reading Horizons  has a variety of  sections: Lessons,   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          81      Vocabulary, Library,  Games,  Pronunciation and  Reports. All sections  are utilized as  necessary to help  students improve in  the areas where they  need remediation.   - Each student is  administered an  assessment to  determine his/her  base level.  Periodically, the  teacher can reassess  students'  performance and  growth can be  measured. ** The  result of the initial  assessment indicates  at what reading level  the student will  begin. Students can  increase their reading  level by completing  stories and correctly  answering the  comprehension  questions that follow.  Data has indicated  that Reading  Horizons enhanced  students'  comprehension,  vocabulary, decoding  skills and attendance.  Students have shown  tremendous growth  in their self-esteem.   - Monthly targets are  differentiated by the  needs of John Adams  High School, the  Special Education  Department and  Compliance to the  PPR, CORe Checklist   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          82      and the Transition  SPP13.   - Weekly ISS  Professional  Development is  determined by  monthly target goals  and in response to  teacher observation,  evaluation, and  feedback and  support.

N/A        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Teachers, through the framework of department and SLC common planning time, play key roles in the selection and  use of assessment measures. One of our core principles is use of the inquiry cycle to assess gaps in student learning,  and to develop and assess instructional strategies designed to close those gaps. Through the use of monthly Regents  pre-assessments we have created a uniform benchmark for each department to use in this work.   During department common planning time teachers review monthly assessment item analysis data for their students  and determine the past and currently taught skills and content with which students had the most difficulty. They then  collaborate to incorporate strategies for closing those gaps into their assessments. While teachers certainly can assess  the success of these strategies through any number of methods, they also create the assessment for the upcoming  month, and design it to assess student learning not only with respect to the content taught up to that point, but to  determine whether the previously identified gaps have, in fact, been closed.   This work is continued, but in a slightly different format, during SLC common planning periods, in which the focus is  on targeted Cohort Q students needing to pass a Regents exam. Since many of these students have broader and   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          88      deeper gaps in learning than do on track students, the fact that SLCs are interdisciplinary in nature allow teachers to  develop strategies which can be used across content areas.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (R-CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          89     conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/R-CEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          90      Section 11: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)        (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  R-CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. John Adams High School , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A  of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   John Adams High School will support parents and families of Title I students by:     providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level,   .g., literacy, math and use of technology;     providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and      decision making in support of the education of their children;  fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress;     providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;     sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and  in languages that parents can understand;     providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and  other members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          91      The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.   Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent  Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.   In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:      actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s  Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of  the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;     engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated   directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;     ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and      strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the  Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing  technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;     maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and  families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the  assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school  environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of  events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.;  conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational  accountability grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and  support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;        provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g.,ESSA/State   accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;     host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise   parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right  to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118  and other applicable sections under the Elementary and Secondary (ESSA) Act;  schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the  morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the  Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions;  translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;              The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          92           holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;    hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school   year;     encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-  Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee;  supporting or hosting Family Day events;       establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;    encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;    providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their   children’s progress;     developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about   school activities and student progress;     providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between /teacher and the home in a   format, and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.   School-Parent Compact (SPC)   John Adams High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act  (ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement  between the school and the families.

The student body includes 20.5% (455 students  Former ELLS 64/Current 391) English Language Learners and 9% of these Ells are SWDs.  The  school is a Title I school. This includes 150 9th grade ELLs ( 43 EN, 28 EM, 24 TR, 33 EX , 13  CM), 133 10th grade ELLs (17 EN, 22 EM, 39 TR, 40 EX, 10 CM) , 85 11th grade ELLs (1 EN,  8 EM, 22 TR, 37 EX, 8 CM) and 87 12th grade ELLs ( 8 EM, 22 TR, 25 EX, 32 CM). The  design of small learning communities provides personalized support for all students while  maintaining a clear identity as a large high school.  The Newcomers Academy supports all ELLs  in bilingual and/or ENL support. Data, including formative and summative assessment results,  monthly assessments, NYSESLAT, a scrutiny of students’ work using the strategic inquiry  process, and observation of their behavior and attitudes, provide a detailed knowledge of all  students including ELLs.  Teachers use data through the inquiry process to review student progress and set language and  learning goals. They work to improve student achievement and credit accumulation to support  student graduation with their cohort. The school’s extensive and varied curriculum, includes an  interdisciplinary approach which is improving students’ literacy skills across the curriculum,  caters to the diverse needs of the ELL students. Common planning time within the small learning  communities is provided for teachers to work together on inquiry, plan and share ideas to support  curriculum, develop strategies in order to achieve goals.  Based on data and trends, double period  classes have been implemented in science in grade 9, global studies in grade 10, English in grade  11 and supports for any class needed in grade 12.  All ENL students are placed in their ENL/ELA and HLA classes according to the  NYSESLAT results, NYSITELL and other assessments.  We have classes according to the New  York State Mandates. (540 minutes, 360 minutes & 180 minutes of ENL/ELA instruction. This  also includes 180 minutes of ENL instruction for all commanding students).  Including the ELA  and NLA instruction required under the CR Part 154. Students will receive language acquisition  as well as support classes in specific content areas. After school and Saturday tutoring will also  be available.  All content area classes meet for 45 minute periods, 5 days per week. All classes meet for 45  minute periods. This includes, art or music and physical education.        At John Adams High School the students are placed in ENL/ELA classes according to their  grade, ENL proficiency levels and skills. ELA/ENL classes are placed by grade level to meet the  needs of an ELL on every grade. All classes are either co-taught or taught by a teacher with a  dual ENL/ELA license. For example: The needs of an entering ELL are different for a Junior and  Senior that need to pass the ELA Regents than a freshman or Sophomore.

In both the Free Standing ENL and Transitional Bilingual programs, ENL is part of the  students’ daily program.  Every level has the correct amount of ENL instruction. All ELLs are in  the Newcomer Smaller Learning Community where we provide the support needed for all  students in a large high school. All SPELLs are placed in an ICT setting with a dual  licenced ENL/ELA teacher and a teacher with an ELA/SWD License.  Teachers record data and monitor student growth through the use of teacher trackers, unit  assessments, monthly assessments and from attendance Inquiry during SLC time 2 days every  other week. Students monitor their own progress using student trackers and progress monitoring  with individual teachers. Mentoring is more than just attendance monitoring helps to motivate  students and provide an adult role model w/in building.   Special attention is paid to ELLs in the  Newcomers SLC to make sure they receive all supports needed. Teachers from all content areas  work on Inquiry teams to maintain records. Notifications to parents concerning attendance and  other school are sent in parents home language through Kinvolved, Skedula and bilingual  teachers to ELLs and non-English speaking parents of mainstream students.  Monthly assessments are used for teachers to use data through the inquiry process to review  student progress and set language and learning goals. They work to improve student achievement  and support credit accumulation to support student graduation within their cohort. The school’s  extensive and varied curriculum, including an interdisciplinary approach which is improving  students’ literacy skills across the curriculum, caters to the diverse needs of our students.  Common planning time within departments is provided for teachers every Monday for an hour  before or after school and every other Wednesday and Thursday. Parent outreach in all  languages, by school staff or translation services, is done every Tuesday. Teachers collaborate on  inquiry, plan and share ideas including curriculum, strategies and goals in order to further  support the ELLs. The directors and counselors of the small learning community work very  closely with the leadership team which is also comprised of the ENL and Bilingual coordinators.  A Bengali speaking director, Hindi speaking director,  Spanish speaking counselor, Spanish  speaking bilingual coordinator and Haitian-Creole speaking ELL coordinator are part of the team  that works collaboratively to support the assistant principal and small learning community in all  their needs. Inquiry teams meet to discuss student issues related to student attendance, progress  and performance. The data is analyzed by the team of pedagogues as they focus on strategies to  support and raise the achievement of the students.  This data is also used to inform teachers on needs for tutoring during and after school. ENL  Tutoring takes place every day after school in all subject areas. The subjects are Global Studies,  US History, Algebra, Trigonometry, Living Environment and ELA. The tutoring takes place  every day of the week week from 3:45 - 5:15 PM to support students on all Regents.  Students  may also use this as a time to work in a smaller setting to clarify misconceptions and receive help  on homework or difficult tasks.  All notifications and tutoring schedules are sent in parents' Home Language, via phone calls,  skedula, letters by mail and Kinvolved. Any mailed notifications are also backpacked home in  English with parents' home language on the reverse side. At monthly ENL Night Nights, all  information is translated into parents' home language using translation devices by a staff  member.  The Writing is Thinking through strategic Inquiry (WITsi) method is used to scaffold the Engage  curriculum. EngageNY is used for all students, including ELLs,  to meet the needs of Regents  and graduation. All teachers collaborate on Regents Inquiry and work together two times per  week during department meetings. Inquiry on student work supports the teachers in finding  deficiencies  within the content area in skills and content.  CCSS reflect knowledge and skills needed for students’ success in college and career  readiness.  Every lesson plan includes CCSS with the goal to improve and expand students’  comprehension and learning.

Some scaffolds that are unique to ELLs might  utilize their home language to help them acquire the knowledge and skill of a new language. For  example; the use of glossaries, dictionaries theme-related reading in home language, bilingual  home language work and class routines that involve pair discussion in both their home language  and English.  Also, using their home language to figure out the meaning of unknown words in  English. Furthermore, differentiated instruction is used to ensure students progress. Scaffolds  such as sentence starters, word banks, supplementary questions and graphic organizers will  gradually be removed as students progress.  SWD’s receive ENL in a setting which meets the needs of their IEPs for their content area  classes. ENL/ICT classes for all grade levels co-taught by an ELA/ENL teacher cooperating with  a SPED teacher have been implemented. All ENL/SWD needs are met in this ELA class.  Freshmen SIFE students are grouped in a program that we have partnered with the CUNY  graduate center called Bridges in order to serve their needs. They also received content area  instruction in English and Home Language Arts in Spanish and Bengali as appropriate. SIFE  classes are served by a Bridges team including subject area teachers of math, social studies and  ELA. Bridges programs have the following key components: A full day of sheltered classes; a  theme-based Bridges curriculum in three subject areas and instructional activities matched to the  unique needs of this population; a program model that relies on interdisciplinary teams whose  subject area content is integrated with language and literacy practices and materials, synced  across the subject areas; usage and support of all students’ home languages.  SIFE students also  benefit from having their own print rich classroom. They have their own leveled classroom  library with both fiction and nonfiction texts.  Entering and SIFE students benefit from Ipads that  allow them to practice their phonetic skills as well as writing by using multiple applications and  programs.    There is separate tutoring for current and continuing SIFE students in all grades two days per  week. One day for language acquisition in ENL/ELA and another to work on fundamental math  and or science skills.    SIFE Academy/Newcomer Academy: The academy is for ELLs newly enrolled to John Adams.  The instructional focus is delivered in 90-minute blocks of content area instruction targeting  ENL, ELA, HLA, math, science, social studies and guidance topics. The program integrates  subject matter through cultural experiences in New York City. Program delivery models include  TBE and ENL Language Enrichment.  Schools can enrich students' home language and English  by building skills through experiential learning, cultural experiences, and targeted instruction in  ELA and HLA.   People's Theater Project also offers enrichment to our Stand Alone ENL classes. Students learn  to express themselves in theatrics and games in order to strengthen their communication while  exploring relatable complex social issues.  “College and Career  Ready” is to provide all ELLs in grades 9-12 with a program that will  improve English language proficiency and advance content area learning. “College and Career  Ready” is to provide all ELLs in grades 9-12 with a program that will improve English language  proficiency and advance content area learning. Students participating in the Title III Program  “College Ready” will have the opportunity to accumulate up to three credits towards graduation  plus any additional credits they could make using APEX.  College Now classes are also offered  in ENL and other areas two days per week.  To help prepare the senior ELLs and former ELLs for college, the year begins with working on  their college application essays. This was tied to the curriculum so that students could see models  of the type of writing necessary for a narrative essay. Research skills were addressed to prepare  them for college level writing. We discussed how to evaluate sources and determine credibility.  We used databases to find credible sources, as they will need to do in college, and worked on  analyzing sources on a higher level. Students learned how to write annotated bibliographies,  outlines, and research papers. We worked on using higher level sentence stems and more college   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          99      Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   level analysis throughout the year. After school, students were able to come and work more on  their research and improve their skills.  Students also had the opportunity to complete the Seal of Biliteracy capstone project.

EngageNY Curriculum is used for all ELLs in ENL/ELA classes. CCLS-aligned instructions,  students will readily undertake the close, attentive reading that is at the heart of understanding  and enjoying complex works of literature. They will habitually perform the critical reading  necessary to pick carefully through the staggering amount of information available today in print  and digitally. They will actively seek the wide, deep, and thoughtful engagement with high- quality literary and informational texts that builds knowledge, enlarges experience, and broadens  worldviews. In short, students who meet the Standards develop the skills in reading, writing,  speaking, and listening that are the foundation for any creative and purposeful expression in  language. The use of WIT activities will be used to scaffold the EngageNY curriculum and make  it accessible to all students.

The students and faculty enjoy an excellent relationship resulting in  student academic and personal development.  In order to serve our students who are over aged and under credited, we have the Seniors  Academy  program which supports these students through intensive guidance intervention and an  accelerated academic program.  This population is given the support they need to succeed  through smaller class sizes and alternative instructional attention.    The school also offers an after school “Young Adult Borough Center” (YABC) program that  helps older students to earn a high school diploma. The school offers students numerous exciting  activities, including visual and performing arts, a United Nations team, and dental hygiene.    At John Adams HS efforts are made to ensure that parents, guardians and families are informed  and are active participants in all areas of school. Some of the ways of engaging parents are  sending a school newsletter in different languages, meetings and workshops.  The parent  coordinator and the executive board of the Parents Association work collaboratively to further  strengthen communication with parents.doing outreach to parent population  Bilingual workshops    All notifications and tutoring schedules are sent in parents Home language via phone calls home,  texts via kinvolved, skedula, and mail.

The  ENL Department Common Planning Time includes work time to ensure that ENL/LOTE  Teachers leave with a collection of strategies and resources that will foster improved student  learning through developing a culture rooted in effective teacher practice. ENL Teachers will  engage meaningfully in the work of improving teacher practice through teacher reflection and  development and understand how the instructional shifts embedded within the CCLS inform  improved teacher practice. Monthly targets are differentiated by the needs of John Adams High  School, the ENL/LOTE, and Compliance. Weekly ENL/LOTE Professional Development is  determined by monthly target goals and in response to teacher observation, evaluation, feedback  and support. Specific, targeted skills and their proven outcomes are shared with teachers during  these meetings.  ENL  PD takes place every Monday each week; Wednesday, Thursday every other week within  departments. Every other week smaller learning communities meet on Wednesdays, Thursdays.  Attendance is taken at each meeting and stored in a binder with the agendas for that meeting  time. Every Monday the AP meets with the department for one hour. On Wednesdays and  Thursdays, meetings are held for 45 minutes.  PD is also given one time a week through the Peer Collaborative teachers. There are 5 PCTs at  John Adams so teachers have the opportunity to receive 5 more professional  learning each week.  The UFT center also offers PD.  It is the intention of John Adams High School to provide quality instruction to English Language  Learners. If teachers plan and implement lessons that meaningfully engage students with  rigorous skills that is content based, along with giving actionable feedback, then students will be  able to revise and develop critical thinking skills and ownership of their learning.  This requires  general education teachers, ENL, bilingual teachers and non-pedagogic staff to be skilled in a  variety of curricular and instructional strategies in supporting ELLs as they engage in the  Common Core Learning Standards. All teachers need to become familiar with the areas in which  ELL students may encounter challenges in a school’s curriculum. They need practical, research  based information, resources, and strategies to teach, evaluate, and nurture ENL students. The  PD plan will provide substantial and sustained opportunities for all teachers to participate in  meaningful professional development that addresses the needs of ELLs. The PD plan will  include the following essential components:  A process for integrating teachers’ understanding of academic content and ENL proficiency  standards with instruction in teaching methods and assessments.  Methods for implementing instructional strategies that ensure that academic instruction in  English is meaningful and comprehensible through the different modalities: speaking, listening,  reading and writing.  Guidance on how to effectively implement strategies that simultaneously integrates language  acquisition, language development, and academic achievement.  Exposure to why increasing academic achievement of ELLs is dependent upon multiple  instructional approaches or methodologies.  Providing a strategic toolkit for teachers, which offers ways to enhance and improve instruction  for struggling students while appropriately challenging more advanced learners, based on  feedback and assessment results.  Cultural awareness opportunities for educators to understand and appreciate students’ different  cultural backgrounds so they can maximize achievement opportunities for ELLS. This will help  to promote diversity pursuant to the Dignity for All Students Act (NYS initiative, effective July  2013)  Co-Teaching Strategies: intentional learning opportunities for all teachers to collaborate and  design instruction, analyze student work, and develop rigorous lessons.   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          106      Part C: Professional Development   Visitation to highly effective teacher using challenging and innovative approaches for the ELLs  Draft of Monthly PD Plan for Teachers of ELLS and all other students:  September/October: Identifying ELLS and Language Proficiency: participants will gain an  awareness of the various characteristics of Newcomers, engage in activities to promote a  supportive learning environment for ELLs, understand how the different stages of new language  development within each modality impact instruction, apply strategies to develop critical  thinking questions.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?    John Adams uses data from multiple sources, such as the NYSESLAT, monthly assessments, attendance, and Regents scores.  These sources inform our teachers about what they need to know to make informed decisions to support students.    At the beginning of the year, teachers use NYSESLAT scores to strategically group students based on grade and proficiency  level. As the year progresses, teachers use school-wide monthly assessments, both in the content and for the language   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          115      proficiency, to track student progress. Using these assessments, teachers use the data for enrichment and deficient areas with  each student or groups of students. This year we will be using the Periodic Assessment to align assessments with the  NYSESLAT.    Formative assessments are used every day to monitor student progress in all content area classes. Teachers track students  progress through teacher created assessments. In conjunction with the EngageNY curriculum, teachers use WITSi scaffolds to  increase student achievement in writing.  Other  examples include the following:  Anticipatory guides  Think-Pair Shares  Do Nows  Quick Writes  Exit Slips  Questioning/Discussions Prompts  Self and Peer feedback using student friendly rubrics and checklists  Student and Teacher Trackers                  2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Using the Inquiry process, during designated weekly meetings,  teacher teams collaborate and look at student work, so they  can  identify gaps from the assessments. This ensures that the needs identified will be met and used as guidance for future  lesson planning. Monthly assessments are used to identify learning gaps and support student learning.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Summative assessments are used monthly with content language and English proficiency. Each content uses a Regents based  monthly assessment and at the same time ELLs use a monthly assessment similar to NYSESLAT.  HLA is used in Spanish,  Bengali, Hindi and French to support ELLs and former ELLs. Assessments in the home language are also used to support and  enrich all students. The English common core curriculum is used as the support and  reference for HLA.  During department  time, teachers use the Inquiry process to look at student work. Based on the data, an area of focus is chosen to work on with  different groups of students. Teachers then update future lesson plans to ensure that the needs identified through the area of  focus are met. Formative assessments are used every day to monitor student progress in the target area and the monthly  summative assessment, teachers are able to track how students progress and ways to improve their supports and scaffolds.  This data also allows teachers to determine high achieving and struggling students. Based on student scores on the  assessments, teachers create individualized supports and activities that best meet the needs of each student.          4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Every week, teacher teams meet as a department after the assessment. These teams meet two times a week every other  week. On the opposite week, teachers meet in smaller learning communities. The teachers from all content areas meet twice a  week and look at data across all content areas. During department time, two times a week,  teachers use the Inquiry process  to look at student work. Based on the data, an area of focus is chosen to work on with different groups of students. Teachers  then update future lesson plans to ensure that the needs identified through the area of focus are met. Formative assessments  are used every day to monitor student progress in the target area and the monthly summative assessment, teachers are able  to track how students progress and ways to improve their supports and scaffolds.

Teachers remove scaffolds and create extension  activities to further challenge high achieving students, as well as target their areas of struggle. Teachers also create extra  supports and scaffolds for struggling students, using school-wide supports such as Writing Is Thinking through strategic inquiry  (WITsi) strategies, Marzano vocabulary techniques, additional modelling, co- teaching, sentence stems, and Cornell notes,  student and teacher trackers.       5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   On a school wide level, the  Resi and New Visions Data Sorter is used to identify at risk students who specifically need  improvement in attendance, credit accumulation, and or regents. On a departmental level the RLAT and ELL Data Analysis Tool  (EDAT) are also used to inform ELL programs. NYSESLAT raw scores are used to group students within proficiency levels and  understand if they are at the high or low end of that level. These findings support instructional needs in instruction.     The RESI and New Visions Data allows school staff to yield student summarizing information that provides the students'  progress toward graduation and college readiness.    The RLAT captures the students’ individual  NYSESLAT scores (for past 3 years) in listening, speaking, reading and writing and  includes the student’s English proficiency levels. The data in the RLAT allows our team to place ELLs in programs that best fit  their needs; plan strategic heterogeneous and homogeneous linguistic groupings; determine how much instructional time  should be spent in the native language and the target language of English and, determine the most suitable amounts of  instructional time for English as a Second Language and English Language Arts, Social Studies, Science or Math.    The  information from the ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT) captures English proficiency and levels, home language, years of  service, attendance, credit accumulation, content area performance and indication of risk factors. The EDAT allows our  department to project a student’s status through the school year. Teachers are able to make data driven decisions about  instruction and programming.  Additionally, our team specifically uses the EDAT for the use of effective design of instructional  programs and interventions for our ELL subgroups (SIFE, Newcomer, Long Term, and Former ELLS). Support classes are given to  all ELLs depending on English proficiency and Regents needed.          7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?     All teachers of ELLs are housed in the Newcomers Smaller Learning Community. At the beginning of the year, teachers use  NYSESLAT scores to strategically group students based on grade and proficiency level. As the year progresses, teachers use  school-wide monthly assessments, both in the content and for the language proficiency, to track student progress. Using these  assessments, teachers use the data to move student through different proficiencies.     The teachers from all content areas meet twice a week and look at data across all content areas. During department time,  teachers use the inquiry process to look at student work. Based on the data, an area of focus is chosen to address  with  students. Teachers then incorporate the discoveries from the data to address the gaps in student learning. Formative  assessments are used every day to monitor student progress in the target area and the monthly summative assessment,  teachers are able to track how students progress and ways to improve their supports and scaffolds. This data also allows  teachers to determine high achieving and struggling students. Based on student scores on the assessments, teachers create  individualized supports and activities that best meet the needs of each student. Teachers remove scaffolds and create  extension activities to further challenge high achieving students, as well as target areas of growth. Teachers also create extra   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          117         supports and scaffolds for struggling students, using school-wide supports such as Writing Is Thinking through strategic inquiry  (WITsi) strategies, Marzano vocabulary techniques, additional modelling, co- teaching, sentence stems, and Cornell notes.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.      John Adams High School has a large population of ELLs including two Bilingual Programs (Spanish and Bengali) and a  standalone ENL program. All SIFE students travel in a block of classes with content areas which includes 2 ENL classes  and an ELA class and a Social Studies class. Math is taught within a common core algebra class for ELLs in the 9th  grade. All ELL instruction is grouped homogeneously by grade and NYSESLAT Level. For instance, all ELA classes are  taught by grade using EngageNY Curriculum and scaffolded for the NYSESLAT Level. (Ex. EES81 is Entering QN1,  Emerging QN2, Transitioning QN3, Expanding QN4 and Commanding level is taught in mainstream ELA  by an ELA/ENL  licensed teacher when possible (with a 2nd period elective taught by an ENL/content teacher). There will be a double  period science class in grade 9, a double period global studies class in grade 10, a double period ELA class in grade 11.  These classes will support ELLs in language acquisition as well as content.     Freestanding English as a new language (ENL) programs provide instruction in English with home language support,  emphasizing English language acquisition. Students in freestanding ENL programs can come from many different  language backgrounds, and English may be the only common language among the students. As per CR Part 154, there  are 2 types of ENL, Stand-alone ENL is instruction to develop English language skills so that students can succeed in  core content courses. It is delivered by a certified ENL teacher.  Integrated ENL is instruction to build English language skills through content area instruction. It is delivered by a dually  certified teacher (ENL and a content area) or co-teaching by a certified ENL teacher and a certified content area  teacher (i.e., English language arts, math, science, or social studies). Both methods of integrated ENL instruction  include content area subject matter and English language development using ENL strategies. All ELLs and former ELLs  up to 2 years after exiting ELL status must receive a minimum number of units of integrated ENL.     At the secondary level, ENL is departmentalized; ENL teachers plan carefully with general education teachers to  ensure curricular alignment and continuity of instruction. All content classes are taught by a bilingual content teacher,  an ELL certified Content teacher or co-taught by an ENL and content teacher.     Student understanding of English while learning classroom content, as well as offer English-proficient peers to serve  as language models. Teachers need to be credentialed in the content area and have an ENL license. Such dually  certified teachers can also provide the mandated integrated ENL units required for all ELLs. Math, science, and social  studies classes are taught by a teacher credentialed in a content area in order for students to receive the proper  credits for graduation. All teachers at John Adams are given professional development in ENL strategies. Instructional  ENL methodologies and content-area expertise complement one another to facilitate and accelerate both English  language and content learning for ELLs. Also, ENL teachers receive professional development on differentiating  instruction, especially since most classrooms are composed of students with varying levels of English proficiency and  subject area expertise in content areas other than ELA. The ELL team at John Adams brings a diverse expertise to our  school. Teachers with multiple credentials, licenses, and extensions offer the school community additional flexibility  to meet student needs. We use the multiple human and fiscal resources that accelerate ELLs’ academic English   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          118         language proficiency and content-area mastery. For instance, each program model taps into and enhance ELLs’  existing home language skills. Programming that clusters cohorts of ELLs with the same home language background in  subject area classrooms allows students to access content by interacting with each other at varying levels of language  proficiencies. Teachers with groups of ELLs who have a common home language organize collaborative tasks that  target content and generate interactions in the home language among peers. Tasks are enriched with academic  English language development. Also, home language resources (libraries, texts, technology, primary resource  materials) are available in the classroom and in the school’s library.      At John Adams HS we offer home language arts (HLA) classes whenever possible. The more literate students are in the  home language, the stronger and more expedient their transition to academic English proficiency. Even schools with  ELLs served through freestanding ENL classes can group students who share a common language together for a home  language arts class.      b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     As per CR Part 154.2, our Transitional Bilingual Education (TBE) program at John Adams High School is designed so  that students develop conceptual skills in their home language as they learn English. All instruction is Common Core- aligned to accelerate student achievement.     Our transitional bilingual education program includes the following:  an ENL component designed to develop skills in listening, speaking, reading, and writing in English  a minimum of 2 content-area courses/subjects in the home language and English at the entering and emerging levels  a home language arts component designed to develop skills in listening, speaking, reading, and writing in the  students’ home language while cultivating an appreciation of their history and culture  all of the students in a TBE program share the same home language.      This year a new program will be intergrated for the Expanding and Commanding ELLs.     As students (all ELLs) develop English language skills, time in the home language decreases. When ELLs reach  commanding on the NYSESLAT, they are placed in a monolingual class in English with home language supports. In TBE  programs, students transfer home language skills to English by spending instructional time primarily in the home  language before steadily transitioning to English.     At the entering level, TBE students receive 75% of instruction in their home language and 25% in English. As a  student’s English proficiency increases, more of his or her instructional day is spent learning in English. In our TBE  program, teachers must make several considerations when determining which language is best to teach certain  concepts. Teachers must consider carefully the rigor of instruction, student familiarity with concepts in the home  language and English, and the academic language required for using and mastering concepts. When determining the  amount of home language and English language used in instruction, teachers consider a number of factors including,  but not limited to students’ proficiency levels, educational backgrounds content knowledge, and home language  literacy skills. This allows for differentiated instruction that meets the individual student’s needs.      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      n/a   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   TBE teachers are critical to ELLs’ transition from home language to English since they serve as language models for both;  therefore, they must demonstrate strong academic language proficiency when delivering instruction in either language. These  teachers ensure that ELLs are familiar and comfortable with reading and writing by helping them develop strong literacy skills   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          119      in their home language simultaneously.  Since many students in our programs come from many different educational  backgrounds for example, Private schools or public schools in villages in Bangladesh. Also, TBE teachers instruct students with  various levels of content mastery and literacy development.  TBE teachers face the challenge of instructing students with  different proficiency levels in their home language as well as in English.        3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   In JAHS’ transitional bilingual Bengali and Spanish and ENL models all utilize somewhat similar strategies and skills to support  our ENL students to guide them to proficient use of the target language. Our curricula is implemented to align with Common  Core Learning Standards that focuses on students' critical thinking and problem solving skills to support the academic and  linguistic demands in core content areas. The strategies and skills learned are relevant to the real world and communication in  both academic and social settings. John Adams integrates curriculum from New Visions and Engage models to meet the  academic rigor promoted by the Common Core Learning Standards.     John Adams teaches integration of literacy-related instructional strategies facilitating student learning in all content areas  through writing, reading, listening and speaking and the use of technology. Across all content areas and programs learning  material is delivered with explicit instruction and teacher modeling, and then continued with scaffolding and assessing student  learning through independent and/or group work. Lessons are planned with rigorous instruction for student-centered  classrooms moving toward students taking ownership of their own learning through rubrics, trackers and self and peer  evaluation.  To foster student independence in comprehending content material, teachers utilize strategies including:  activating prior knowledge, think-pair-share, graphic organizers, accountable talk stems, multiple entry points through  vocabulary, group work, sentence stems and modifying the text. It is critical for teachers to embed the strategies into the  content that is being taught which is aligned with the state standards, district curriculum, school mission and grade-level goals.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home language throughout the year. They receive HLA in Spanish, Bengali, and  French. Students receive a monthly assessment in their HLA class which is aligned with the ELA Regents. Monthly assessments  measure student growth in their speaking, reading, listening and writing skills.  HLA Spanish students take the ELE exam to  analyze their progress in reading Spanish. SIFE students receive HLA in Spanish or Bengali to support their needs in language  acquisition.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status         A. SIFE  Upon entering John Adams High School newcomers are interviewed and asked questions about their school history to  determine if they are SIFE.  Then they are given the MLS test. Students who score below 3rd grade reading level are placed in  the Bridges to Academic Success program. Bridges is a pre 9th grade sheltered program.  The curriculum includes classes in  ELA, Foundational Language and Literacy, Math, Science, and Social Studies designed to meet the needs of these students and  prepare them to participate in the secondary classroom.  Designed with an integrated language and content learning approach, The Bridges curriculum reflects bestpractice for English  language learners who cannot lose time learning English before they learn academic content. By creating an interdisciplinary  set of materials across the four subject areas around common themes, the instruction reinforces conceptual knowledge,   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          120      vocabulary, and oral language development. Specialized for low literacy students, the lessons are geared for students who  need substantial support in accessing the content topics and in learning to read, speak, listen, and write in English, a new  language to all.  The curriculum incorporates visuals (e.g., photos, illustrations, video clips), readings adapted to the lowproficiency levels of the  students, activities to build writing skills appropriate to the content area, and unit projects that allowed students to  demonstrate the knowledge they were gaining over time. Student collaboration is a key tenet of instruction. Recommended  techniques and learning routines are included as teacher supports. The curriculum is based on the New York state standards of  elementary and middle school subjects to determine appropriate skills and topics the Bridges students would need to learn so  they would be better prepared to access the regular 9th grade curriculum the year following Bridges. It is aligned to common  core and language development standards. The curriculum also helps students learn academic study habits.  Across the different disciplines instructional methods are used .  These routines are central to targeting the academic needs of  SIFE. Some of these methods are the following  Part of becoming an engaged learner involves cultivating the ways of thinking that are integral to academic literacy. These  methods support students to externalize, through dramatization, role play and routine oral practice, the ways of thinking,  questioning and evaluating that need to be internalized to build their academic literacy. The ELA Bridges curriculum is divided  into part 1 and part 2.  The goal of ELA Part 1 is to expose students to rich language and content through challenging and  rigorous informational and narrative texts.  The focus of ELA Part 2 is learning to read and write and draws on both the  Foundational Skills and ELA Skills. Students are assessed in both reading and writing in English. Students rotate through four  centers, each of which targets a specific area of language and literacy differentiated to matchthe student's’ goals. Students are  actively involved in setting goals to advance their reading, and the centers provide the space, through applied practice, to build  fluency and competence and foster independence andself-regulation.  b. Newcomer  Entering/Emerging: In order to help newcomer students who have no or limited exposure to English build their language skills  so that they can access and engage in content, teachers use a variety of strategies. For vocabulary building, some effective  strategies include creating a classroom word wall that incorporates translations from the students’ home languages; personal  dictionaries (student-generated) using the Marzano formatting that includes the vocabulary word, definition in English, home  language translation, and an image and/or sentence that uses the given word; and classroom labeling (where different parts of  the classroom are labeled in English and also the students’ Home language. Also, as a pre-reading exercise, students are  provided with images that relate to the vocabulary words relevant to the text. For lower proficiency Entering students, the  teacher provides the students pre-annotated texts so the students have definitions for important words available on the  handout. In order to help students both access content and improve their sentence writing skills, teachers use various WIT  activities, including one in which students must identify whether a set of words is either a fragment or a sentence and then  repair the fragment using relevant text details and proper punctuation and capitalization. This particular activity enhances  students’ understanding of the text and also allows students to practice writing grammatically correct sentences.  Transitioning: English Language Learners who are Transitioning may work more independently than lower proficiency ELLs.  However, they still require scaffolds in order to have success in the challenging curriculum and increase their CALP (Cognitive  Academic LanguageProficiency). Like Entering and Emerging students, Transitioning students require vocabulary support, so  teachers use many of the strategies mentioned above. However, Transitioning students are expected to begin writing their  own well developed paragraphs. These students receive scaffolds at the beginning of the academic year to facilitate their  writing (e.g., paragraph outline that provides students with the topic sentence and/or conclusion sentence) that are removed  as they progress during the year.  Additional Strategies: The following is a comprehensive list of strategies that ENL teachers incorporate in their instruction to  promote student language acquisition:  Masterful Reading: As the students are exposed to rigorous texts from the beginning of their academic careers, it is necessary  for the teacher, a fluent English speaker, to model reading a textwith correct intonation and enunciation for ELLs. In order to  increase students’ comprehension, teachers give a masterful reading of the text (a minimum of two readings) during  instruction. Before the second reading, the teacher provides students with a focus question that will lead them to the aim is  introduced; during the second reading, students annotate the text for details related to the question. Depending on the class,  teacher might need to read the text for the third time and then have a discussion about students’ responses before moving  the activity.  WIT: All students are introduced with WiTSI in a sequence; i.e. first sentence expansion and after mastering it sentence   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          121      combining activity will be taught to them. Entering and Emerging students may get simplified worksheets and even fewer  numbers than the Transitioning group. Teachers will model in all cases at all times. The first two groups may also get  paragraph numbers added to their worksheet as part of scaffolding so that they can complete the task without frustration. For  appositive activity, the first two groups may receive the worksheet as matching or have a word bank while the Transitioning  students will complete the activity individually without that scaffold.     c. Developing (3-6 years)     Across content areas and different programs developing ENL students’ language abilities and skills are improved through  fostering their habits to use academic vocabulary and linguistic structures. This is completed through referring to synonym  charts, accountable talk stems; and using graphic organizers, WITsi strategies, peer evaluation and targeted teacher feedback  with rubric, text scaffolding through chunking, purposeful groupings, vocabulary bank, sentence stems and frames. Writing is  differentiated through WITsi paragraph and/or multi-paragraph outlines, entry points are given through vocabulary banks,  sentence stems and content clues and group discussions. Reading comprehension of academic texts is scaffolded by teachers  activating background knowledge through pictures, videos, quotes and different realias. Next, that knowledge is used to segue  into reading and comprehending the text. To further comprehension and use the text to improve students’ language abilities,  teachers extract complex sentence frames and Tier 2 vocabularies from the text that have high word frequency. Teachers  solidify their usage through explicitly highlighting and using the targeted Tier 2 vocabularies in their own speech and writing,  students learn through examples on how to utilize it in their own speech and writing. Fluency is always gained through  repetition and increased exposure, so teachers are vigorous in their word and sentence choices when speaking and writing.  The constant exposure and reminders for student integration allows for a fluid transition into students’ speaking and writing.  Differentiated instruction means teaching the same material to Long Term ELLs using a variety of instructional strategies and  delivering lessons at varying levels of difficulty based on the ability of every student. Formal assessment is an essential part of  this method. Students in class are grouped by shared interest, topic or learning ability. Classroom teachers create a safe and  supportive environment continually assessing and adjusting their lessons to meet students' needs. Student trackers are used  and students use self-assessment trackers in order to keep up with their learning and to watch their progress in the content  area. Some differentiated instructions that are being used for Long Term ELLs are:  - matching vocabulary words to definitions, Word Walls, dictionaries/ Marzano dictionaries;  - reading, annotating the assigned passage and answering related questions/focus questions;  - identifying an author's position and providing evidence to support this viewpoint;  - chunking context;  - text scaffolding/annotation;  - reading stations with flexible grouping;  - different entry points (exploration of a given topic through different activities);  - 'traffic lights'  - tiered activities where the teacher keeps the concepts and skills the same for all students, but provides varying levels of  complexity.  -Student trackers  -Teacher trackers  Teachers vary whole-class instruction by teaching small groups based on students' learning profiles, heterogeneous or  homogeneous grouping.    Like all of our ELL subgroups, John Adams teachers use multiple strategies depending on student needs. Teachers ensure that  former ELLs received the support they need through using multiple forms of assessment, both formative and summative, to  track student progress and see what areas they need support in. Teachers ensure that they have appropriate language  objectives for each lesson so that all students can appropriately access the content. Some differentiation techniques  commonly used with former ELLs are the use of modeling, new vocabulary strategies, graphic organizers, and  think/pair/shares. These strategies help the students better access the content and share their thoughts and ideas in English.  Because these students have a high English proficiency, teachers use techniques to help students write more complex  sentences through more specific vocabulary, subordinating conjunctions, and various sentence types. Teachers also use more  open ended discussion techniques, such as socratic seminars or debates, to help push student thinking. Now that they have   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          122      the language to better discuss their thoughts, students are able to facilitate class discussions on their own with minimal  teacher support. Additionally, teachers remove supports that are no longer necessary. For example, teachers show students  how to personalize their writing and add their own voice through no longer relying on the sentence stems they learned in the  past, and writing it in their own words. Teachers show students different ways to write the same sentence, and how they need  to write it using their voice by changing it and not always writing it the exact same way. Teachers also remove some scaffolds  in reading through having more independent reading assignments and having students create their own questions about the  text for their discussions, instead of teacher- made questions.          6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Students with Disabilities/ are placed in an integrated co-teaching class with a dual licensed ELA/ENL teacher and a  SWD teacher. All ELL and Students with Disabilities use the same reading material, Engage NY curriculum. Depending on the  needs of the students some of the strategies to support and enhance their learning are creating a word wall, Marzano  vocabulary worksheet, sentence frames, matching, modeling, word bank, masterful reading, various graphic organizer namely  sequence chart, timeline, story map and WiTSI activities etc. Since students are taught Engage materials, all readings are  Common Core aligned. Also, students receive scaffold suggested by Engage as well.  One strategy to assist student reading comprehension is through chunked reading texts. This consistent method is used to  ensure students have complete grasp of material to then continue with a thorough analysis. For example, during a Romeo and  Juliet unit, along with chunking text material, students are provided with a “no fear Shakespeare” variation to support limited  language skills. These scaffolds do not only serve as guidance through the masterful reading portion of the lesson but also as a  support when students are working in groups.  To assist students with limited language, students are provided with daily vocabulary as  part of the frontloading vocabulary  activity which consists of key terms which will be used in the lesson of that day. The teacher states the new term, provides a  definition and a graphic. The students repeat the term, write down the definition and then are engaged in a discussion. The  discussion is centered of breaking down the term using student phonic skills. This is crucial for students to use this to build  their vocabulary knowledge. An example of a term can be de-extinction, such a term can be “broken apart” for the students to  use their phonic skills. These tasks are essential for students to become confident independent readers. As time progressed in  the year, students were then able to use their skills and recognize word forms and relations.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Students with Disabilities/ELLs are placed in an integrated co-teaching class with a dual licensed ELA/ENL teacher and a  SWD teacher. All instructional needs are met by the student's IEP. If students need support in language, a language transition  para is attached to that student.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  At John Adams High School we incorporate many strategies and tools into our programs to meet the needs of ELL students in  ELA classrooms as well as in the content areas. We have full Bilingual programs in Spanish and Bengali.  The students also can  take literature and  advance classes in their native languages.  Our curriculum includes ENL classes that target the 5 performance levels:  entering, emerging, transitioning, expanding  and  commanding. Some of the tools included in our  ENL and content area classes are the following:          9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?        Based on data and trends, due to  low passing grades on Regents, new support classes in all grade level content area will be   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          123      considered for next year. For example, a support class in Living Environment will be taught by an ENL teacher.  All ELL instruction is grouped homogeneously by grade and NYSESLAT Level. For instance, all ELA classes are taught by grade  using EngageNY Curriculum and scaffolded for the NYSESLAT Level. (Ex. EES81 is Entering QN1, Emerging QN2, Transitioning  QN3, Expanding QN4 and Commanding level is taught in mainstream ELA  by an ELA/ENL licensed teacher when possible (with  a 2nd period elective taught by an ENL/content teacher). There will be a double period science class in grade 9, a double  period global studies class in grade 10, a double period ELA class in grade 11. These classes will support ELLs in language  acquisition as well as content.     On a positive note, all Expanding students with a 80+ average will be part of a STEM ELL program. These students will be given  ENL support and mandated minutes but will also receive enrichment in all content areas. This will improve student outcomes  and enrich their instruction with the mandates of being college and career ready.  To provide ENL students with exposure to technology and computer science and how it can and has impacted and influenced  the past, present and future of our society. Students will have a new understanding of how technology operates, the  widespread impact it has across the media, health, business/economic, family, political and education sectors within our  world.  This will maximize a student’s potential and ensures that students are well-equipped to meet the challenges of the  future in the world around them.

Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs when they achieve an English proficiency level that allows them to be  successful in such programs.  For example, students who are in ENL Transitional, Expanding and Proficient are programmed  into general education classes with mainstream peers.  They are also offered the opportunity to branch out into different  elective classes and small learning communities in our school like Law, Leadership, Health and Sports, etc.  Apex computer  courses are offered to upper classmen that are in need of meeting graduation requirements in a limited time.  There are  several after school tutoring opportunities that are open to all students.

What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  The use of instructional materials, including technology, are used to support all ELLs.   Below are the support systems used for students throughout the year:  Reading Horizon is used in order to help with students who are low level readers.  Newsela is used to differentiate non-fiction reading , it is presented in a student friendly format for all reading levels.      Achieve 3000 is incorporated for those students who need to work on their level and can increase their proficiency in English  and in Spanish.  Naviance is a comprehensive college and career readiness solution that helps align student strengths and interests to post- secondary goals, and improve student outcomes. This benefits our students to perform their best on test day and helps  students to be college and career ready.  Scaffolded materials and differentiation are used across all content areas using WITSI activities.  PupilPath allows students to access their performance information per class.  Class progress, assignment due dates and description, attendance, grades/status of assignments and exams.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   At John Adams HS, we offer home language arts (HLA) classes as it is essential to language acquisition.. The more literate  students are in the home language, the stronger and more expedient their transition to academic English proficiency. Students  who share a common language together are grouped for a home language arts class. We currently offer HLA in Spanish, Hindi,  Bengali and French.     In our TBE program, students transfer home language skills to English by spending instructional time primarily in the home  language before steadily transitioning to English. At the entering level, TBE students are expected to receive 75% of instruction  in their home language and 25% in English. As a student’s English proficiency increases, more of his or her instructional day is  spent learning in English. In TBE programs, teachers must make several considerations when determining which language is  best to teach certain concepts. Teachers must consider carefully the rigor of instruction, student familiarity with concepts in  the home language and English, and the academic language required for using and mastering concepts. When determining the  amount of home language and English language used in instruction, teachers should consider a number of factors including,  but not limited to students’ proficiency levels, educational backgrounds content knowledge, and home language literacy skills.  This allows for differentiated instruction that meets the individual student’s needs.        2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          126      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    At John Adams HS, students are programmed for ENL according to their NYSESLAT Level and grade level. Many of the ELLs  arrive to JAHS as Entering and Emerging, and require more mandated hours of ENL. The students also need more language  acquisition and academic language in order to pass regents and graduate high school in four years.

Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   The ENL team at John Adams recognizes the importance helping newly enrolled ELLs make a smooth transition into a new  school community. The students are presented with many different activities and resources before and throughout the school  year. For example, before the start of the school year, John Adams invites all incoming freshmen two events: New Student  Orientation, organized by our Parent Coordinator, Manakshi Panindranauth, this organization provides students with the  opportunity to become familiar with the school’s resources and make connections with current students, faculty, and staff  before beginning classes. Students are also invited every year to our Freshmen Field Day, coordinated by COSA. Hundreds of  incoming freshmen participate in numerous team building activities and meet new classmates and faculty to build a sense of  community amongst the students. Once classes start, the ENL team also invites our freshmen to a Town Hall assembly, where  Newcomers directors, Solaman Chowdhury and Divine Leonardo, ELL coordinator, Shirlene Magna and Bilingual coordinator,  Yaneris Carbone inform students about necessary credit accumulation, the regents need to pass, information on clubs and  organizations and all other John Adams support structures available to them.  Our team also provides students with gift bags  with school supplies and welcome kits. Our welcome kit provides a plethora of school related information that will contribute  to a successful school year. Students who enter throughout the school year are first given a one on one orientation with our  ENL intake team, where students and parents are given an individualized tour of John Adams High School. Students are also  paired with a student mentor who speaks the same language for the first week to minimize barriers, ease and welcome the  newly admitted student to the John Adams community.        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    The language electives offered to ELLs are Spanish, Bengali, and French. Native Spanish and Bengali students take classes in  their home language. All other ELLs, have the option of taking a foreign language class in either Spanish or French. All language  classes follow a three-year sequence and end in students taking the LOTE (Languages other than English) Regents Exam.  Additionally, AP Spanish Language is offered to native students at the completion of the three-year sequence and AP Spanish  Literature will be offered next year. Also, students receive college credits after school through CUNY York College for college- readiness.        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Professional development is provided by assistant principals, bilingual coordinator, ELL coordinator, directors, teacher leaders,  PCTs, Urban Arts, People's Theatre Project,  DOELLs, Field Support Services and  the “UFT Teachers Center”. In addition,  teachers attend conferences organized by outside training providers. Opportunity to observe their colleagues’ classrooms, in  there own and in other departments, is a strong feature of the school’s program of improving instruction.  School-based professional development that supports teachers in using the Danielson Framework for Teaching as part of the  observation and feedback cycle, to propel professional growth.

ENL Teachers will engage meaningfully in the work  of improving teacher practice through teacher reflection and development and understand how the instructional shifts  embedded within the CCLS inform improved teacher practice. Monthly targets are differentiated by the needs of John Adams  High School, the ENL/LOTE, and Compliance. Weekly ENL/LOTE Professional Development is determined by monthly target  goals and in response to teacher observation, evaluation, feedback and support.  It is the intention of John Adams High School to provide quality instruction to English Language Learners. If teachers plan and  implement lessons that meaningfully engage students with rigorous skills that is content based, along with giving actionable  feedback, then students will be able to revise and develop critical thinking skills and ownership of their learning.  This requires  general education teachers, ENL, bi-lingual teachers and non-pedagogic staff to be skilled in a variety of curricular and  instructional strategies in supporting ELLs as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards. All teachers need to  become familiar with the areas in which ELL students may encounter challenges in a school’s curriculum. They need practical,  research based information, resources, and strategies to teach, evaluate, and nurture ENL students. The PD plan will provide  substantial and sustained opportunities for all teachers to participate in meaningful professional development that addresses  the needs of ELLs. The PD plan will include the following essential components:    A process for integrating teachers’ understanding of academic content and ENL proficiency standards with instruction in  teaching methods and assessments.    Methods for implementing instructional strategies that ensure that academic instruction in English is meaningful and  comprehensible through the different modalities: speaking, listening, reading and writing.    Guidance on how to implement strategies that simultaneously integrates language acquisition, language development, and  academic achievement.    Exposure to why increasing academic achievement of ELLs is dependent upon multiple instructional approaches or  methodologies.    Providing a strategic toolkit for teachers, which offers ways to enhance and improve instruction for struggling students, based  on feedback and assessment results.    Cultural awareness opportunities for educators to understand and appreciate students’ different cultural backgrounds so they  can maximize achievement opportunities for ELLS. This will help to promote diversity pursuant to the Dignity for All Students  Act (NYS initiative, effective July 2013)    Co-Teaching Strategies: intentional learning opportunities for all teachers to collaborate and design instruction, analyze  student work, and develop rigorous lessons.      Draft of Monthly PD Plan for Teachers of ELLS and all other students:    September/October: Identifying ELLS and Language Proficiency: participants will gain an awareness of the various  characteristics of Newcomers, engage in activities to promote a supportive learning environment for ELLs, understand how the  different stages of new language development impact instruction, apply strategies to develop critical thinking questions.

John Adams High School will meet the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers will receive ELL-specific professional development.  Professional development is dedicated to language acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies  and integrating language and content instruction for English language learners. Teachers meet 3 times a week every other  week for common planning time through Department and the Newcomers Small Learning Community. There will be alignment  with core content area instruction, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and  content instruction for English language learners. Records will be kept for professional development activities in a binder with  appropriate agendas and attendance.  Electronic links may be created for teachers’ registration of additional courses offered  through the UFTTC at John Adams         Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   The ENL team at John Adams individually meets with the parents or guardians of ELL at least once a year, in addition to parent  teacher conferences, initial parent orientations, quarterly progress meetings or other scheduled meetings provided for parents  or guardians, to discuss the goals of the program, their child’s language development progress, their child’s English language  proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in  content areas. Meetings specifically informs the  parent/guardian about the child’s language development in all content areas in English and in the child’s home language in the  case of students enrolled in a bilingual education program.  Parents/ guardians are provided with student’s individual  assessment results, reading results and progress reports. On numerous occasions parents are also provided with description  and explanation of the curriculum in use at the school, the form of assessment used to measure student progress and the  proficiency levels students are expected to meet.  For struggling students specific meetings are held and parents/ guardians  are provided with opportunities for discussions between parents, administrators and staff to address problems and find  solutions for students having difficulties, either academically or socially.  Theses meetings are conducted with qualified interpreter/translator in the language or mode of communication the  parent/guardian best understands.  Skedula and Kinvolved are used daily for Parent outreach.         2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Parent involvement in our school, including parents of ELLs, is a key component at John Adams High School.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Daniel Scanlon, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          133                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   John Adams                                                                              School DBN: 27Q480  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      John Adams High School will provide translation and interpretation of documents based on the number of non- English home languages in the school and the number of students with non-English home language. When a  student is admitted, a licensed pedagogue translates during the oral interview. If the parent speaks a language  other than English, it is noted in the student's file.      We will follow the ESSA Mandate involving families of students whose home language is not English by sharing  parent-school accountability, offering parents the information for their children's educational options and for the  parents to have the capacity to improve their children's achievement. By communicating with the parents in their  preferred languages John Adams is supporting the shared parent-school accountability experience.       2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          135         2.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      In the event of school emergencies, a phone blast (automated messages) are sent in preferred languages. Kinvolved  (Text messages) are instantly sent in designated languages and English to parent body. Skedula (email) is also instantly  sent. Letters on school letterhead are backpacked and mailed home in parent preferred languages.            Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure    Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.         2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          143      The LAC, AP ENL, ELL Coordinator, and Bilingual Coordinator oversee and monitor the DOE’s provision of language  assistance services to LEP parents. They work closely with school staff (giving PD if necessary) to ensure that the DOE’s  translation and interpretation services support the needs of the LEP parent population. They serve as primary contact  for schools for ongoing guidance and support, provide input regarding appropriate budget allocations for translation  and interpretation services, and monitor and evaluate how schools use translation and interpretation funds;    Develops and provides training to relevant school staff; provides Language Access Kits, Kits include a multilingual  welcome poster, a Language Identification Guide to help determine the language spoken by a parent, an  informational brochure about the services provided by the T & I Unit, and an over-the-phone card for school staff that  outlines how to obtain an interpreter. These tools are in all offices and front desk of the school.          Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      John Adams meets all identified needs of translation and interpretation. Sudents and parents need translation with  grades, foreign transcripts, failing senior letters, Department Progress Report letters, NYSESLAT notifications about  testing, locations and decisions, NYSITILL, Automated telephone messages, attendance outreach calls, guidance  conferences, suspension conferences, class trips and parent workshops. Skedula and Kinvolved are used daily. These  findings were discussed in school leadership meetings and parent association meetings. The finding was addressed by  submitting a Budget Plan for translation and interpretation. Procedures to ensure timely provision of translated  documents are provided by in-house staff support and the Interpretation Unit. If the meeting is face to face an in  interpreter is provided. Over the phone translation through the DOE is also used. If languages are not spoken by any  staff member, we will use the Guideline Language Center for document translation and face-to-face interpretation  (T&I) needs for this upcoming school year 2018-2019.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       A survey is sent home on skedula to provide information on the services they receive. Kinvolved messages are sent  after each meeting and/or information nights. Parents are asked to provide feedback about the event. Calls are made  to different parents to ask if their needs are being met. During all parent nights, surveys are provided to see if we can  improve our translation services. Meeting are attended by different staff members that speak most languages spoken  by the parent body.          2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          144
