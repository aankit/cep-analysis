This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Our mission is to work with families to prepare each sixth through twelfth grade student academically, emotionally,  intellectually, and socially to succeed in a college of his or her choice and beyond.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   The Washington Heights Expeditionary Learning School (WHEELS) will serve students in grades Pre-K, K, 1, 2, 3, 4, and  6-12 in the 2018-2019 school year. We have 865 students. 56% are boys. 94% are Hispanic.   We are a New York City Outward Bound School and part of the national Expeditionary Learning Network. We partner  with Teachers College, the After School All Stars, Global KIds, and several other organizations. We have a 501c3 called  Friends of WHEELS.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   At the Washington Heights Expeditionary Learning School (WHEELS) language instruction for ELL students will also  include a Title III-funded after school program; ELL ACHIEVEMENT PROGRAM. We will serve English language learners  students in grades K to 4 and 6 to 12 via after school programs to address students’ needs in reading, writing, listening  and speaking. Materials are in a varied genre and at different levels to meet the language needs of our English  language learner population. Some materials include audio books and books that support content in the native  language of our ELL population. We have been working diligently to ensure the appropriate materials are being used  effectively. Currently, we have several mobile computer labs, which are utilized on a rotating basis by all of our  students including ELLs.       As a school community where over 90% of students indicate a home language other than English, as such, we will add  additional support to serve current ELLs and former ELLs that are still struggling with academic writing. Given the high  level of academic rigor in all WHEELS students' programs, we will utilize the seven reading strategies (activating  schema; asking questions; drawing inferences; creating sensory images; determining importance; synthesizing and  using fix up strategies) along with the six plus one writing strategies. The overall goal is to have students continue to  practice and reinforce their college-ready writing skills.       According to the NEA, research shows that "ongoing professional development allows teachers to share their ideas  and concerns and support one another in finding ways to work effectively with ELLs." It is important that teachers  engage in this dialogue and work because it gives teachers more tools to help close the achievement gap for ELL  students. The Title III Professional Development will include three PD sessions of 1 hour after school devoted to the  needs of ELLs and will be aligned to the NYS ‘Blueprint for ELL Success.” Teachers participating will be all staff of the  ELL Achievement Programs. The professional development will be provided by our ESL certified staff. The topics to be  covered are as follows: Looking at student data/work to understand our students as readers and writers, Examining  and sharing best practices for all classes to use that reinforce language development and literacy skills for ELLs,  Providing instructional supports to differentiate for ELL students that are struggling academically so that they can  produce high quality work.    While we invite parents and families to all WHEELS workshops on student needs, we do not seek to use Title III money  toward this end.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10         Parent involvement at WHEELS specifically with Ells is organized to ensure we are informing the parents of the  success, concerns and plans for their students academically. Information about events and workshops are sent as  written notices in both English and Spanish. For Parents who do not speak English or Spanish, we use translation  services over the phone in order to communicate with them. The students also lead a Student Led Conference in  which they present their work to their parents and reflect on how they are learning in all of their classes, so that  students families and teachers can engage in making the best decisions for the child's education.      All Ells have a crew advisor (teacher) who is in constant communication as needed with the parent/guardian in  regards to behavior, academic and language progress. We offer information sessions regarding the schools culture,  progress, and continuity of services at the beginning of the school year. We are in consistent communication with the  families of ELL students to keep them informed of student progress and give parents opportunities to ask questions  and offer information about their children. The needs of the parents are evaluated by having one to one meetings  with parents as needed. In addition meetings that are organized by the Ms. Aquino the parent coordinator that  focuses on specific issues important to parents of Ells. Each parent has a crew advisor for their child, which is the  primary contact for any immediate issues and concerns. In addition each grade has a team leader, which is dedicated  to the families needs on their grade level. Grades K-6, 7-9 have one dedicated counselor and grades 10-12 have  another guidance counselor in addition to a college counselor.   Parents also participate in different learning celebrations that happen as our students participate in Expedition  Learning projects. In addition we hold three Student Led Conferences in the school year in which students themselves  speak to their parents about the specific learning targets they are engaged in , in all subject classes. Students also  speak about their HOWLS (Habits of work and learning) and specifically identify which habits they have mastered and  which habits they need to work on. Lastly each trimester in Student Led Conferences parents, teachers and students  set goals and a plan to achieve these goals. Student Led conferences happen before report card grades are due which  gives families and teachers an opportunity to discuss any specific goals or interventions that need to take place to  make sure the students have success in their classes.   In addition as 8th graders transition to high school parents are invited to an annual meeting that takes place usually in  October to discuss the options available for WHEELS students who stay in WHEELS or choose to apply to a different  high school. This meeting is facilitated by Ann Glynn our middle school guidance counselor and high school enrollment  advisor and Rosemary Aquino, our parent coordinator. Parents of our English language learner population , and all of  our students meet with teachers and college counselors throughout the year to get assistance and guidance in the  college application process. This school year 2017-18 we have 1 lead college counselor, a part-time college counselor  and an alumni coordinator who will assist and guide all students in high school including our English language learners  as they apply and explore college options.   Additionally, we have grown to include elementary grades as well (final elementary grade 5 to be added next year).  Parental involvement has been an integral part of the successful launch of our elementary school. Parents have been  included and involved with Community Circles. Each week, the whole elementary school will meet together in a  shared space from 8:50 am to 9:20 am. Classes will take turns planning and running these meetings. Each meeting  may include activities such as a greeting, sing-along, sharing of student work (including performances), public  appreciations, structured conversation (i.e. reflection on a quote or reading), announcements, and/or service learning  updates. Family members are invited to community meetings as a way to strengthen our community and share school  activities with families.

High standards for rigorous instruction are set across our classrooms. After reviewing the 2017-2018 NYC Survey  results with our SLT, we saw that two questions stood out, both in the Academic Press section. We saw that 62% of  students felt that teachers ask difficult questions in class, and 59% of teachers felt that students answer challenging  questions.    While our overall scores in this section have continued to rise, these two questions are outliers.

Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   75% of students say that teachers ask difficult questions in class, as measured by student surveys, focus groups, and NYC  Schools Survey.    As a result of these rigorous questions, 90% of our 9th graders will earn the necessary credits to be on track to  graduation and 35% of our middle school students will score proficient on the Math State Tests.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34        Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. WHEELS, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the ESSA, is  responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of  student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed  by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are  encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee  as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      WHEELS will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of our  FTA, as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent  Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input. To increase and improve parent  involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under ESSA;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

The small group targeted support will help  students with content understandings and also focus on writing in Social Studies, knowledge that  can also be used when writing for other content classes.         (HS) ESL/Literacy: 30 sessions (_1.5_ hours per session)  Mondays & Wednesdays/3:30-5:00  1-ESL certified teachers  ELD component: Language support through reading and writing strategies for developing  fluency in English  30 Students  Rationale: As a school community where over 90% of students indicate a home language other  than English,  as such, we will add additional support to serve current ELLs and former  ELLs that are still struggling with academic writing.  Given the high level of academic rigor in  all WHEELS students' programs, we will utilize the seven reading strategies  (activating schema;  asking questions; drawing inferences; creating sensory images; determining importance;  synthesizing and using fix up strategies) along with the six plus one writing strategies. The  overall goal is to have students continue to practice and reinforce their college-ready writing  skills.

It is important that teachers engage in this dialogue and work because it  gives teachers more tools to help close the achievement gap for ELL students. The Title III  Professional Development will include three PD sessions of 1 hour  after school  devoted to the  needs of ELLs and will be aligned to the NYS ‘Blueprint for ELL Success.” Teachers  participating will be all staff of the ELL Achievement Programs. The professional development  will be provided by our ESL certified staff.  The topics to be covered are as follows:      •    Looking at student data/work to understand our students as readers and writers.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45         Part C: Professional Development     •   Examining and sharing best practices for all classes to use that reinforce language  development and literacy skills for ELLs    •   Providing instructional supports to differentiate for ELL students that are  struggling academically so that they can produce high quality work.

Parent involvement at WHEELS specifically with Ells is organized to ensure we are informing  the parents of the success, concerns and plans for their students academically. Information about  events and workshops are sent as written notices in both English and Spanish. For Parents who  do not speak English or Spanish, we use translation services over the phone in order to  communicate with them. The students also lead a Student Led Conference in which they present  their work to their parents and reflect on how they are learning in all of their classes, so that  students families and teachers can engage in making the best decisions for the child's education.    All Ells have a crew advisor (teacher) who is in constant communication as needed with the  parent/guardian in regards to behavior, academic and language progress. We offer information  sessions regarding the schools culture, progress, and continuity of services at the beginning of  the school year. We are in consistent communication with the families of ELL students to keep  them informed of student progress and give parents opportunities to ask questions and offer  information about their children. The needs of the parents are evaluated by having one to one  meetings with parents as needed. In addition meetings that are organized by the Ms. Aquino the  parent coordinator that focuses on specific issues important to parents of Ells. Each parent has a  crew advisor for their child, which is the primary contact for any immediate issues and concerns.  In addition each grade has a team leader, which is dedicated to the families needs on their grade  level. Grades K-6, 7-9 have one dedicated counselor and grades 10-12 have another guidance  counselor in addition to a college counselor.     Parents also participate in different learning celebrations that happen as our students participate  in Expedition Learning projects. In addition we hold three Student Led Conferences in the school  year in which students themselves speak to their parents about the specific learning targets they  are engaged in , in all subject classes. Students also speak about their HOWLS (Habits of work  and learning) and specifically identify which habits they have mastered and which habits they  need to work on. Lastly each trimester in Student Led Conferences parents, teachers and students  set goals and a plan to achieve these goals. Student Led conferences happen before report card   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46         Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    grades are due which gives families and teachers an opportunity to discuss any specific goals or  interventions that need to take place to make sure the students have success in their classes.  In addition as 8th graders transition to high school parents are invited to an annual meeting that  takes place usually in October to discuss the options available for WHEELS students who stay in  WHEELS or choose to apply to a different high school. This meeting is facilitated by Ann Glynn  our middle school guidance counselor and high school enrollment advisor and Rosemary  Aquino, our parent coordinator. Parents of our English language learner population , and all of  our students meet with teachers and college counselors throughout the year to get assistance and  guidance in the college application process. This school year 2017-18 we have 1 lead college  counselor, a part-time college counselor  and an alumni coordinator who will assist and guide all  students in high school including our English language learners as they apply and explore college  options.     Additionally, we have grown to include elementary grades as well (final elementary grade 5 to  be added next year). Parental involvement has been an integral part of the successful launch of  our elementary school. Parents have been included and involved with Community Circles. Each  week, the whole elementary school will meet together in a shared space from 8:50 am to 9:20  am. Classes will take turns planning and running these meetings. Each meeting may include  activities such as a greeting, sing-along, sharing of student work (including performances),  public appreciations, structured conversation (i.e. reflection on a quote or reading),  announcements, and/or service learning updates. Family members are invited to community  meetings as a way to strengthen our community and share school activities with families. Other  family activities include family potlucks, family welcome dinners, orientations, home visits and  volunteer opportunities in an effort to engage all families, including the families of ELLs, in the  school community.     Lastly, The Family and Teachers Association (FTA) is an active collective working to improve  our school community.  The FTA will work to raise additional funds for the school, specifically  for arts enrichment programs, parent workshops, and family nights.   The FTA and school will plan regular family nights (monthly), which will include fun activities  for the entire community and provide information about curriculum.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  For early literacy skills of our students we use Founats & Pinnell, this has told us that students were coming in significantly  below target levels. Our K-3 (will be growing by year) dual language program is aiming to develop literacy in both the Native  Language and English to better support the students academically.  For our Middle grades we use DRP to  periodically assess  English language development for all students.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Based on the data from the various assessments, ENGLISH and ENL teachers plan curriculum and interventions to better  support students. Department meetings happen every 1-2 weeks. Additionally, literacy blocks are incorporated in to the  teaching day to provide small targeted instruction to ELL students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50         3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We evaluate the the success of ELL Programs on a variety of levels, the percentage of students that demonstrates growth on  their English proficiency based on both the NYSESLAT and NY English Exams. We also look at growth data for reading levels in  the lower grades, which based on that data we made program and personnel changes (i.e. Dual Language went from  alternating teachers every other day to self-contained classes with single teacher or team teacher to provide dual language  services) Lastly because of AYP data for ELLs, a specific targeted school-wide work plan goal has been implemented in order to  see improvement, and school-wide PD and inquiry is being done around that work plan goal.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Teams, within and across curriculum regularly examine a variety of student work to gather further data from the  summative assessments. This information is used as exemplars, next step interventions, and rethinking of curriculum.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Starting in 2015/16 school year, we began training one teacher in RTI in each level of our school: Lower Grades, Middle  Grades, and Upper Grades. Those teachers work in consultation with instructional guides, department chairs, and our ENL  Coordinator to design interventions at each level to utilize the  benefits of  RTI with the needs of our English Language  Learners.        6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Typically are students make gains after 1-2 years  at our school. Overall we do a good job of moving ELLs that test at low  proficiency levels and get them to Advanced/Expanding levels. We are working to push students from Expanding to  Commanding, the majority of our students, falls into that category. We provide school-wide PD to teachers around providing  support to ENL and SpEd students.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   At the beginning of each school year, NYSESLAT data is broken down by modalities for each student and shared with teachers,  so that they can better understand the learning styles and needs of their students. For other outcome assessments teachers  also look at item analysis data and plan next steps with the disaggregated data.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Individualized schedules in grades 9-12, students schedule is based on SpEd status, ENL minute requirements and  credit accumulation. In grades 6-8: students travel in groups designated by LEP status and SpEd entitlement, teachers  assigned are based on license (SpEd, ELL extension and Content). ALL students K-3 follow dual language program with  certified teacher.     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Students were all divided with number of minute requirements as per their NYSESLAT results and students were scheduled for  class/teachers accordingly. In the case of some SpED students, their IEP requirement was given precedents over their ENL  minutes, because shortage of ENL certified staff.        3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.         All core content is delivered in English, scaffolds provided by content teacher or ENL push-in support tailored to individual  and or class. All content teams examine and develop curriculum that is rigorous and CCLS aligned.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   Students are offered translation services and or dictionaries when appropriate. Students are offered Spanish courses to further  develop their home languages.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    We provide targeted instruction within their classes and in after school programs not just based on these designations, but  also using the strengths and areas for growth as indicated by their NYSESLAT score breakdown as well as their student work  throughout the year. .        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Alll teachers were introduced to GoalBook which tracks and provides individual strategies for a variety of needs for both ELLs  and SWDs. All teachers use mastery-based grading and in addition to ensuring that work is appropriately scaffolded, the  students are also afforded multiple opportunities to demonstrate mastery in a variety of ways.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?

We use Expeditionary Learning materials to support ELLs with deep dives into one specific context and content so that they  can build comprehension and vocabulary.        13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Students in the DL classrooms use their home language every day or every other day. In the ENL classroom, teachers use  cognates and if needed uses the home language to support students.        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.   We use CCSS to ensure that all curriculum corresponds to age and grade level and then support ELLs with strategies to  achieve.        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?

All of our electives are open to ELLs.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   EPs and ELLs are integrated all day using a roller-coaster model in a heterogeneous classroom. So EPs and  ELLs spend half the day in English and the next in Spanish.  Core content is taught in both languages.  Each language is separated based on the time of the day, so if Spanish is in the morning English is in the  afternoon, and then the next day English is in the morning and Spanish is in the afternoon.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   WHEELS                                                                              School DBN: 06M348  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
