The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7     In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           8       NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           10      Section 4: SCEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   1. The mission of P.U.L.S.E. (Providing Urban Learners Success in Education) High School is to meet the academic  needs of our students with in-depth understanding of concepts and skills. We believe it is important to structure their  learning and their environment appropriately, so that their academic and social experiences are relevant and  meaningful to their lives. We persist in our belief that every student has the ability to grow by connecting with others,  with their work and with the world. We believe our purpose is to prepare our students for a better self, a better  community, a better world and better future.       2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    PULSE and Learning To Work (LTW) participated in a Summer School Reflection Protocol in August, 2018. During the  meetings, the team reflected on their fourteen-year partnership. Though LTW provided academic, social and  emotional supports through seminars, internships, job placements, college applications, and counseling for some of  our students, PULSE and LTW agreed that the team needed to reach more students. As a result of the discussion,  PULSE and LTW revised the terms of their partnership to focus on supporting student enrollment, attendance and  progress through ongoing joint on-site initiatives. This year, PULSE and LTW will be participating in student and family  outreach to improve attendance and student progress. The planning team will collaborate to develop appropriate  attendance incentives to motivate students. In addition, they will work together to coordinate college trips, college  and career-readiness training, skills-building workshops as well as group and individual counseling.    During SY 2017-18, Socratic Seminar International provided professional development services for PULSE teachers.  Teachers participated in workshops, teacher team meetings, inter-visitations and debriefs to examine their teacher  practice. Teacher teams employed the Danielson Framework focusing on Domain 3 - Instruction. Teachers completed  self and peer evaluations as they focused on their use of questioning and discussion techniques to engage and  motivate student in Socratic seminar. At the end of Cycle 2, 40% of PULSE teachers conducted seminars weekly using  a three-part model (seminar prep, seminar and seminar reflection). By the end of Cycle 3, 75% of PULSE teachers  conducted seminars using either the three part model or a variation of the model. By the end of Cycle 4, 80% of PULSE  teachers committed to furthering their development in Socratic seminar for SY 2018-19.   In SY 2018-19, PULSE teachers will:   (a) continue to develop and to sustain Socratic seminar as a school-wide strategy that improves teacher-level of  questioning and gives student voice value in the classroom   (b) revise lesson and unit plans to reflect DOK questions and Socratic seminar questioning strategies and discussions  techniques   (c) expand student voice through student-led discussions   (d) continue to conduct informal and formal observations, team walk-throughs and peer reviews with fidelity   (e) continue to strengthen student ownership of learning through uniformed self and peer assessment, and  conferencing         3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           11      P.U.L.S.E. is a “last option” for many high school students struggling, academically, socially and emotionally. Currently  our school has no established credit and/or Regents test requirements for entry. This means a student may enter  P.U.L.S.E. with “0” credits and “0” Regents exams. Currently, we are the only transfer school in the city that offers this  option. Nevertheless, we require all potential students to participate in an interview process. Students and their  parent/guardian are expected to attend the interview together. For the interview, we analyze the students’ transcript,  last year’s attendance record, and last report card. From our analysis, we are able to make queries about a student’s  readiness for the P.U.L.S.E. experience. Our incoming ELLs and SWDs are placed in an Integrated Co- Teaching/Collaborative Co-Teaching (ICT/CTT) for ELA and Math. Students received additional push-in and pull-out  resources during advisory. Students interested in PM School receive additional one-on-one instruction with a content  area teacher and/or ELL/Special Education teachers.   P.U.L.S.E. provides an accelerated academic program for students who desire to graduate with a New York City High  School Diploma. Each student receive approximately 365 minutes of instruction weekly for each academic course as  well as 150 minutes of social and emotional learning during Advisory. Secondly,  students taking P.M School courses  receive approximately 55 hours of instruction for each course, and a total of 220 hours of instruction for four courses  during the academic year. Student may attend P.M. School to earn credits or to prepare for the New York State  Regents examination. we provide specialized preparatory courses for the students who sit the New York State (NYS)  Regents exams. Our Saturday School, normally held eight (8) times during the school year, offers students additional  opportunities to prepare for the academic, psychological and emotional demands of standardized examinations.  P.U.L.S.E.'s partnership with Fedcap through the on-site Parent and Attendance Coordinators, foster ongoing outreach  to parents and families regarding daily attendance as well as students' academic and professional performance. Our  partnership offers 50 current P.U.L.S.E. students job placement through paid internships and on-the-job development  through weekly seminars, Learning to Work (LTW) provides professional and academic services such as resume  development and interviewing skills workshops, college application and financial aid services, college entrance test  prep and tutoring services for the P.U.L.S.E.’s student body. Each student is assigned to a LTW advocate. Throughout a  student’s time at P.U.L.S.E., he/she may communicate with his/her advocate for academic, professional, social and/or  emotional purposes.          4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Framework for Great Schools: Rigorous Instruction   PULSE revises its curricula annually to ensure that it is accessible to diverse learners and it is aligned to the Common  Core Learning Standards (CCLS). Teacher teams at PULSE examine teacher pedagogy on the classroom and team levels  to refine their sets of beliefs about how their current students learn best. They look at the needs of all learners to  determine the best instructional strategies that will engage and motivate their learners. They develop common  grading practices and assessment tools to determine student learning outcomes (what did they actually learn) and  adjust their lesson plans and assessments to meet the needs of their students.    Quality Review 2018 : Instructional Core (1.1, 1.2, 2.2 - Proficient)   The 2018 Quality Review report stated that P.U.L.S.E.'s curricula is planned to ensure cognitive engagement for all  students. It engages the highest and lowest achieving students in the learning process. Furthermore, the curricula  reflects college and career readiness. Teachers use Socratic seminars to support student engagement, resulting in  high levels of student thinking and participation. Teachers use classroom assignments and rubrics to provide  actionable feedback to students. In addition, teachers use student self-assessment and checks for understanding  during instruction to make adjustments that support student learning.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           12         Framework for Great Schools: Supportive Environment:   P.U.L.S.E.'s learning community establishes a culture of learning through its protocols, routines and rituals. The  community establishes high expectations and provides supports for students, families and staff to fulfill them.  P.U.L.S.E. has three tenets: trust, respect and responsibility. These tenets support the academic and personal growth  of its students and adults.   Quality Review 2018: School Culture (1.4, 3.4 - Proficient)   The 2018 Quality Review report stated that students and adults treat each other with mutual respect. The school  community welcomes and values student voice through advisory, meetings, town halls, and conferences. Students  participate in planning Game Night (twice per year) and the Seniors meet with the principal and their advisors weekly  to plan activities and events. Behavioral supports such as case conferencing and mediation are aligned with student  learning needs.    Framework for Great Schools: Effective School Leadership   The school leader analyzes learning outcomes for students and observes teachers using the Danielson Framework for  Teaching. The school leader uses the outcome of the analysis and the framework to improve instructional practice,  protocols and strategies so that teachers can grow professionally.   Systems for Improvement (4.1 - Developing)   The 2018 Quality Review report stated that though teacher feedback is beginning to show support for teacher  development, informal feedback and feedback forms do not indicate or articulate clear expectations for teacher  development and improvement of practice. Considerations are steps to improve a particular practice and feedback  from follow-up observations.                   2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           13      School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 10X319   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   239   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   # Special Classes (ELA)  # Special Classes (Math)   # Visual Arts  # Foreign Language   % Title I Population  % Free Lunch  % Limited English Proficient   3  4   7  4   % American Indian or Alaska Native  % Hispanic or Latino  % White   # SETSS (ELA)  # SETSS (Math)  Types and Number of Special Classes (2018-19)  # Music  # Drama  # CTE  # Dance   46  28        # Integrated Collaborative Teaching (ELA)  # Integrated Collaborative Teaching (Math)   School Composition (2017-18)   92.0%  % Attendance Rate  89.1%  % Reduced Lunch  4.6%   % Students with Disabilities   Racial/Ethnic Origin (2017-18)   31.0%  % Black or African American  57.3%  % Asian or Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander  0.4%   % Multi-Racial   Personnel (2015-16)   Years Principal Assigned to School (2018-19)  % of Teachers with No Valid Teaching Certificate  % Teaching with Fewer Than 3 Years of Experience   14.25  0%  0%   # of Assistant Principals (2016-17)  % Teaching Out of Certification  Average Teacher Absences (2014-15)   Student Performance for Elementary and Middle Schools (2017-18)   ELA Performance at levels 3 & 4   Science Performance at levels 3 & 4 (4th Grade) (2016-17)   N/A   N/A   Mathematics Performance at levels 3 & 4  Science Performance at levels 3 & 4 (8th Grade) (2016- 17)   Student Performance for High Schools (2016-17)   ELA Performance at levels 3 & 4  Global History Performance at levels 3 & 4  4 Year Graduation Rate   Regents Diploma w/ Advanced Designation   42%  19%  8.2%   0.0%   Mathematics Performance at levels 3 & 4  US History Performance at Levels 3 & 4  6 Year Graduation Rate (2011 Cohort)  % ELA/Math Aspirational Performance Measures  (2015-16)   Reward  In Good Standing  Focus District   Priority School   Overall NYSED Accountability Status (2018-19)   No  No  Yes   Recognition  Local Assistance Plan  Focus School Identified by a Focus District   No   Focus Subgroups   -

Quality Review 2017-18   According to the Quality Review report for SY 2017-18, P.U.L.S.E. has a focus on culture-building, discipline, and social- emotional support. P.UL.S.E. has structures in place to ensure that each student is known well by at least one adult who  helps to coordinate attendance, social-emotional learning, and child/youth development. As a result, students and  adults treat each other respectfully. PULSE welcomes and values student voice through advisories, meetings and  conferences. PULSE aligns behavioral supports such as Case Conferencing with their students' learning needs.    Priority Needs:     P.U.L.S.E. wants all students to follow the rules, listen carefully when the teacher gives direction and pay   attention when they are supposed to. In addition, the staff wants all students to try hard to get good grades so  that the students can continue their education after high school. Post-secondary education for PULSE is college  and/or career training that furthers the student;s development and provides them with the appropriate tools  and resources to function interdependently in our global society. Finally, the staff wants students to feel safe.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           25         They want to support students when they face troubles in school and provide the support they need to catch up  in class as well.

Quality Review (2017-18)   According to the Quality Review report for SY 2017-18, across classrooms, teachers and students use rubrics that are  aligned with the school’s curricula. Across classrooms, teachers’ assessment practices consistently reflect the use of  ongoing checks for understanding. Teachers use classroom assignments and rubrics to provide actionable feedback to  students. Additionally, teachers use student self-assessment, check for understanding during instruction, and make  adjustments to support student learning.    PRIORITY NEEDS:     Though PULSE teachers work effectively in teams, teachers need effective feedback and next steps to support   their growth. Feedback from teacher observations (supervisor and/or peer) helps to identify trends and to  determine next steps for individual teachers. In addition, feedback helps to define the focus of professional  development and evaluation.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  P.U.L.S.E. selects incoming teachers with prior teaching experience based on the nature of the curriculum planning,  assessment and instruction cycles required in an accelerated program. Teachers are hired based on their capacity and  willingness to participate in the instructional planning cycles, and are given assignments accordingly. Teachers must  be comfortable differentiating content using vocabulary, going deeper (depth) and going from abstract to concrete  and concrete to abstract. Teachers must be familiar with youth development principles and practices as noted prior,  and their relevancy to over-aged or under-credited and at-risk youth. Teachers select professional development  opportunities based on self review as well as peer and administrator recommendations. Teachers are inspired to  return to P.U.L.S.E. yearly based on their opportunities to support, create, lead and innovate within our learning  community. The teachers develop sustained relationships with their students, parents, peers, staff and  administration. As a result, they are motivated by the personal and professional growth of their students within our  school family. Lastly, teachers see a place for them at P.U.L.S.E. and opportunities for them to grow beyond their  present assignments.        2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the strategies and activities for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, staff, and  paraprofessionals that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   The focus will continue to be on providing activities that are rigorous, job-embedded, on-going and sustainable,  student centered, geared toward career readiness and data driven. With regards to the CCSS and the performance  data the following professional development needs are being met: reading and writing skills and strategies. sentence  skill, problem solving and number sense. Continued professional development on reading and analyzing informational  texts and writing opinions and arguments in response. In addition, strategies and activities integrating and  implementing the CCSS with the infusion of Danielson Framework will be regularly addressed. Teachers will complete  a self assessment based on the 2017-18 APPR.    Teachers will select their groups based on readiness and interest. Groups are designed around the Danielson  components.

Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     All decisions at P.U.L.S.E. are made through a process of collaborative problem solving. Every teacher is involved in  the decision-making process. Teachers use student achievement as a constant barometer in their decision making  process of selection of appropriate multiple assessment measures. Student achievement is consistently monitored  through a variety of formative assessments including programs such as the Regents results. These programs give  teachers the opportunity for immediate student feedback as well as the ability to analyze and evaluate assessment  scores based on areas of strengths and weaknesses. In turn, a portion of professional development trains teachers to  develop lessons based on assessment data. As teachers utilize assessment data , they make connections and respond  to trends in student learning. This strategic monitoring has enabled and continues to enable teachers to target  instruction to students’ strengths and weaknesses.             2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           52     4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           53       Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           54      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.U.L.S.E., in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      P.U.L.S.E. will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           55      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:      ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           56      ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;      The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  This does not apply because we are a high school.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   N/A     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           63         Our ELLs graduate and go to college at similar rates as our general education students. Therefore, we consider our program to  be a success. The assessment tools used is their progress academically in their content area classes as well as standardized  state exam scores.  In addition, we do look at ELLs meeting AYP.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?   Tutoring, homework help, push-in and pull-out (ELA), team teaching (ELA, Special Education and ESL teachers)     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   This does not apply  as we are a high school.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Our students struggle with reading and writing more than listening and speaking. There is usually one proficiency level  difference. This is true across grades.        7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Tutoring, homework help, push-in and pull-out (ELA), team teaching (ELA, Special Education and ESL teachers)         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   At PULSE we have a freestanding ESL program. Students in our freestanding ESL program are mixed in heterogeneous,  ungraded classes. They take their classes with native speakers to share learning experiences.  Differentiated  instruction allows teachers in all content areas to work with small groups of students to improve their skills.  ELLs and  former ELLs benefit from being able to work on their skills together and native speakers, wo are also able to learn  language skills from the ELLs. Entitle ELLS and former ELLs are programmed for ESL classes according to language  proficiency.  All students receive ESL receive 80 minutes of ESL in tandem with their English class one period a day, 5  days per week. Integrated ENL is offered in ELA classes, with the ENL teacher pushing in one period a day, five days  per week, regardless of student proficiency level.      b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              All classes at PULSE HS are 80 minutes in length, which provides a total of 400 minutes of ESL instruction weekly to all  ENL students regardless of student proficiency level.  Integrated ENL is offered in ELA classes, with the ENL teacher pushing in       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           64      one period a day, five days a week regardless of student proficiency level. This exceeds the minimum number of minutes  required each week for both Beginning and Intermediate ELLs.       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      All content area classes are taught in English with supplemental materials to assist our ELLs. Group work is used extensively,  which encourages students to interact with each other and allows students to participate at their current skill level. Other  assignments differentiated to allow students to progress at their own pace.  Small group activities provide the opportunity for  academic language scaffolding and Total Physical Response (TPR). Usage of these strategies help our students to meet and  exceed state standards and assessments and the Common Core Learning Standards.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      Students are required to complete the same language requirements as all other students. The first language of all of our ELLs  is Spanish.        5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    SIFE in high school are intellectually able to comprehend the assignments but have difficulty completing them because of gaps  in their education.  Small group instruction allows instructors to more easily identify these gaps and provide further  instruction/scaffolding to fill in the holes. SIFE students receive 1 period of push-in ESL daily. They are paired with advanced  level ELLs in various content area classes as a way of providing peer-to-peer support in addition to support provided by the  teacher.  The ESL teacher currently has a collection of graphic novels of texts currently part of the ELA curriculum to support  instruction in ELA.   We do not have any newcomers.  If we were to have newcomers in the future, they would be placed in classes with another  ELL student "buddy". This partnership would allow a newcomer to have a specific person to go to for questions about  academic and social issues. This helps to pave the way to a smoother transition to life and school in New York.  They would  have the mandated time in ESL classes.  Teachers in content areas would provide alternative assignments, based upon the  linguistic skills of the student as well as additional time to complete assignments.  They would be offered the option of taking  mandated exams in English or their native language.  The Test Coordinator would test students at the end of the year to  comply with NCLB requirements.  ELLS are placed in mandated ESL classes as well as content area classes.  Teachers in content areas would provide alternative  assignments, based upon the linguistic skills of the student as well as additional time to complete assignments.  They would be  offered the option of taking mandated exams in English or their native language. The Testing Coordinator would test students  at the end of the year to comply with NCLB requirements.  Long Term ELL students receive more than the mandated number of minutes of ESL instruction.  In content areas,  differentiated instruction allows students to have alternative assignments, based upon their linguistic skills and are given  additional time to complete exams and assignments.  They are offered the option to take mandated exams in English or their  native language. They have the use of glossaries and dictionaries in their native language.   Each year they are given the  NYSELAT. The ESL teacher tracks the progress made by ELLs who have reached proficiency on the NYSELAT, providing academic  support when needed.                2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           65      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   ELLs with special needs are served by both the ESL and SPED teachers.  They have push-in in SPED and ELA classes. They meet  daily in Resource Room, to improve skills in all areas. In content area classes they are provided alternative assignments, based  upon their linguistic and academic skills and are offered additional time to complete assignments and exams. They are offered  the option of taking mandated exams in English or their native language. Each year they are given the NYSESLAT.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  PULSE High School employs 80 minutes bock class scheduling and a heterogeneous non-graded class setting which enable all  students to achieve their goals (IEP and instructional goals) and attain English proficiency with the least restrictive  environment.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  ELLs are offered tutoring after school which provides them the opportunity to ask questions on an individual basis, strengthen  their skills and to recover credits that they may be missing.l Regents preparation activities are also offered after school in ELA,  math, social studies, and science. ELLs may also take advantage of one-on-one tutoring, a program which assists students in  literacy and numeracy skills.  Many of these classes are provided in English.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      No new programs will be considered for the upcoming school year      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A because we do not have a bilingual program at our school     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are eligible to participate in all activities.  Our Learning to Work Program, which provides paid internships, counseling, and  assistance in attending college works with ELLs. PM School, which provides tutoring, Regents preparation, individualized  instruction and credit recovery, is available to all ELLs.       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  ELLs have access to bilingual Spanish English dictionaries.  Materials for some content areas area available in translation. Many  of our teachers and support staff members speak Spanish and are able to assist in native language translation/interpretation  when necessary.        13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   PULSE  High School always provides translation when needed. Native language support is made through our teaching staff  through independent reading books in the teacher's classroom libraries.  Over 60% of the entire PULSE High School staff is  fluent (reading, writing, speaking) in Spanish the dominate home language at our school. The LAP team has begun discussion  to prepare for a time when the school has ELLs whose native language is not Spanish.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All services are provided to all ELLs through ESL teacher and guidance counselor.  We make sure to provide services that are  developmentally appropriate for our students who are ages 17-21 years old and in grades 9-12.          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           66         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    ELLs have access to bilingual Spanish English dictionaries.  Materials for some content areas area available in translation. Many  of our teachers and support staff members speak Spanish and are able to assist in native language translation/interpretation  when necessary.        16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   The school conducts open houses for all students who wish to transfer to our school in September and October and May- August. The ESL teacher and apparent coordinator are present at the open houses to answer questions ELLs and their families  may have about what type of programming is available.  ELLs who are admitted in the middle of the school year are paired  with ELLs who are familiar with the school.  These students help new ELLs navigate the school.  ELLs meet regularly with the  ESL teacher and guidance counselor who keeps track fo their integration into the school.       17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    All the elective classes are available to all ELL students.      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?     N/A because we do not have a bilingual program at our school.      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Our PD plan includes a focus on the literacy needs of all of our student sub groups including ELLs. We attend in-house training  as well as PD offered by the DOE.  PD sessions take place weekly based on the following focus topics are:   Building Academic Vocabulary  Engaging and Supporting English Language Learners in Classroom Discussion  Scaffolding Reading of Complex Texts for English Language Learners  Using Student Data to Inform Adjustments that Address the Needs of English Language Learners     Professional development is facilitated by the PD team which includes instructional team teachers as well as other ESL  specialists from the DOE. Professional learning sessions take place on Fridays during our schoolwide PD time. Teachers work  with facilitators in small groups with needs identified through analysis of observation and student work data.   Teachers are offered weekly PD along with general education and SPED teachers and strategies are developed and supported  in the engagement in the Common Core Learning Standards in to all classes, including ENL standalone classes as well as  Integrated ENL classes.  The activities will include planning to provide students with multiple entry points and differentiated  activities and assessments, in order to better meet the ENL student needs.           2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           67         2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  N.A. PULSE  is a transfer high school.  Each year part of our PD plan includes workshops about working with ELLs which more than meets the hours required. In  addition, teachers have the option to attend QTEL training to further their knowledge. The school holds PD during department  meeting every week.For all meetings, the PD Lead Teacher will keep all agenda and attendance records, and ENL teacher the  teacher herself keeps all information in regards to the professional development sessions.        Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?    All parents are invited to Family Nights and Parent Teacher Conferences, PA meetings and workshops, and student  performances. Invitation and information regarding these events is mailed  in both English and Spanish. Interpretation and  translation is provided to all parents for all events. During DOE scheduled parent-teacher conferences, the ENL teacher sets up  individual parent meeting as check-ins throughout the year. At these meetings, the NYSESLAT is discussed, as well as the  student's progress i both his/her ENL core subject area classes.  Translators are provided as needed. There is an annual  meeting held for ELL parents at the beginning of every school year.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   All parents are invited to Family Nights and Parent Teacher Conference,  PA meetings, workshops, and student  performances.  Invitations and information regarding all events are mailed in the parents' preferred native  language.  Translation services are provided at all school events.  There is an annual meeting held for ELL parents at the the  beginning of the year. Parent Coordinator is fully accessible to all ELL parents and she encourages parent involvement.             Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Carol Wiggins, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      PULSE High School uses parent-reported and student-reported data to assess the language needs of our  community. This data is accessed online through ATS. PULSE updates ATS data by collecting biographical data on  the school blue card and entering the information in ATS. PULSE staff assesses information when the student  biographical reports are printed out through ATS as well. We use the information from the home language survey  to determine the language that is spoken at home. We use the RAPL list generated from ATS to assure that the  school's knowledge of the family's preferred language is accurate for all of our students.               2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           71     2.
