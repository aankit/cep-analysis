This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      The mission statement of PS 234 describes the school as a warm and academically supportive environment with a  commitment to providing opportunities to learn in meaningful contexts. “P.S. 234, Independence School, focuses on  children working together in an interactive setting. Children are viewed as individuals with specific strengths, needs   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      and learning styles. We are committed to meeting our children where they are, and extending their learning as far as  we can."      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   PS 234 is a zoned community school in Tribeca serving 650 students from Kindergarten through fifth grade. Utilizing a  constructivist, progressive approach, the school facilitates rich and meaningful instruction through semester long  integrated content studies on each grade level. Explicit, rigorous education is delivered utilizing the workshop model  across literacy and math content areas. PS 234 benefits from a supportive and involved parent body. Evidence of  parental involvement is ubiquitous. Families are fully immersed in school and classroom life, regularly collaborating in  learning experiences with students and teachers and organizing community-building events. The arts are a  fundamental component of PS 234 students’ academic life. Students in Kindergarten through third grade benefit from  choral education. Visual arts instruction is delivered through a full time arts educator in grades one through five.  Instrumental instruction begins in third grade and fifth graders work with educators from the National Dance  Institute.      Our curriculum of interdisciplinary studies accommodates these differences so that all children can achieve their  potential. Studies at P.S. 234 are centered on core curricula in social studies and science. Through rich thematic units,  students develop skills such as inquiry-based research, non-fiction reading and writing, oral communication and  artistic expression. Enrichment programs in art, music, library and science often support the classroom thematic  studies as well. Our literacy program includes components such as read aloud, shared reading, guided reading,  independent reading, book clubs, word study/spelling instruction and writer's workshop. All classrooms from  Kindergarten-Fifth Grade use the TERC Investigations in Number, Data and Space as their core mathematics program.  Through inquiries, activities and games, and the use of manipulative materials, children construct mathematical ideas,  explain their thinking and practice skills. All children in grades 4 and 5 may choose to play a brass, woodwind or string  instrument or sign up for general music studies. Fourth and fifth grade children who play instruments will have two  lessons a week in a small group. Some lessons may be offered before or after school.” (PS 234 website, 2016).       Teachers and staff work in collaboration with service providers and family to provide students with special needs the  support and skills necessary to be successful in the classroom and fully access grade level content curriculum. The  school has demonstrated notable progress improving collaboration between teachers to support the needs of all  students in the classroom, particular those demonstrating challenge academically and socially. (Collaborative  Teachers, Framework for Great Schools, 2015). Streamlining the Response to Intervention process while realigning the  purpose and expanding the support of Pupil Personnel Team has supported this work.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Twenty percent of the population requires an Individualized Education Plan and the school built its special education  program considerably in recent years. Each grade level contains at least one Integrated Co-Teaching classroom and is  fully invested in the inclusion of all students.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      The school has progressed significantly in its establishment of a supportive environment by universally adopting the  Responsive Classroom approach (Supportive Environment, Framework for Great Schools, 2015). With the support of a  fully trained leadership team, targeted professional development focusing on supporting students’ social and  emotional well-being was comprehensively delivered throughout the academic year.        Developing formative assessment systems to promote and drive classroom instruction remains an area of focus in the  2018 - 2019 school year (Rigorous Instruction, Framework for Great Schools, 2015).               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 02M234   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   0K,01,02,03,04,05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   642   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Column B   Verify with an (X)   Section Reference(s)   Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local                                                  1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S 234, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      P.S 234 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  The New York City performance assessment to assess ELA literacy skills in used.  Teachers perform running records throughout  the year to assess a student's growth in literacy. In grades K-2, teachers use the TC running records, and in grades 3-5 teachers  use the Serravallo reading assessment. The data produced by these assessments allows classroom teachers and the ELL  teacher to streamline instruction to the reading level and needs of the students. We use these assessments to guide our  instructional planning for ELLs in order to properly place them into groups that focus on skills needed at their level. Examples  of these groups included guided reading and guided writing groups. These groups are created in order to target the ELLs' needs  that the data created by the formative assessments. As an example, the data may show that ELLs need retelling language or  strategies to determine vocabulary words. These guided groups aim to address these needs. By planning for this guided  reading and writing time with ELLs, the ELL teacher and classroom teacher and better able to address the needs of ELLs in the  school.  Additionally, our curriculum is project based. Through this lens, we assess ELLs’ ability to strategize, think critically and  communicate both orally and in written form.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Once data is collected from running record assessments, teachers are able to share the results with the ELL teacher and  administration both through face-to-face interactions and a shared document that monitors progress. Disseminating this data  found through formative assessments allows us to inform our instructional planning in a number of ways. The primary  structure put into place in the classroom is guided reading groups based on the reading levels and needs of students. Students  are provided with texts that are individualized for their reading level and teachers target their instruction to address the  reading skills needed to move on to more advanced levels. For example, students who struggle to retell stories in the reading  assessments receive scaffolded instruction that pushes retelling language and different strategies to retell stories. The ELL  teacher and classroom teacher use the data collected from running records to collaborate on appropriate pedagogical  strategies to support the content and linguistic needs of the child. We want to make sure the child is making gains toward their  reading MOSL goal. We also use the classroom teachers' other literacy assessments, such as pre- and post-writing  assessments to monitor how an ELL progresses in English proficiency. To provide additional support with the scope and  sequence, the classroom teacher and ENL teacher meet to collaboratively plan to differentiate the curriculum so that it  accessible and engaging for the student. The ELL teacher has access to all of the curriculum content for all grades so that she  can better anticipate the needs of the ELLs based on the data created and help teachers implement scaffolds to support the  children during class time.        3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  School leadership and teachers use the results of the ELL Periodic Assessments, NYSESLAT, NYSITELL, and other language based  assessments to identify ELLs’ areas of need and monitor progress. These assessments help provide our teachers and staff with  detailed information about our students’ strengths and weaknesses in English language development. First, the ELL teacher  can access students’ NYSITELL and NYSESLAT scores through ATS to determine the breakdown of test results.  The results  provide information on the students’ performance in the four modalities (listening, speaking, reading writing). By analyzing the  “Exam History Report,” we can also see patterns of individual student performance.  This is very helpful when it comes time to  place students in learning groups and also to see what areas need improvement. For example, students who scored lower in  the writing modality will be placed into a group that leans heavier on writing structure and development.  Furthermore, the  ELL teacher uses periodic assessments to assess language growth in the four modalities throughout the year. These  assessments are kept in the child’s file for the year to monitor progress. The ELL teacher shares the results of these periodic  assessments with the teachers so she can collaborate with the classroom teacher to determine what types of scaffolds will  help the child in the classroom. The rubrics used in these assessments help the ELL teacher identify areas of need, such as  improving word choice or pushing students to use more complex sentence structures in their writing.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    School leadership and teachers use the results of the ELL Periodic Assessments, NYSESLAT, NYSITELL, and other language based  assessments to identify ELLs’ areas of need and monitor progress. We share the findings with the staff and, in particular, to  teachers of ELLs. By looking at student data over several years, such as NYSESLAT scores for individual students, we are able to  determine where our students are making progress in their English proficiency and where they need more support. These  assessments, along with the summative baseline and mid-line assessments completed by the ELL teacher, provide information  on the students’ performance in the four modalities. This information in turn serves as a resource to help the ELL and  classroom teachers better plan for lessons.  By seeing where specific strengths and weaknesses fall, we are not only better  able to group students, but we can also focus on problem areas and lean less on the areas they excel in.  This is not to say a  student who scores high on reading will not read during small group instruction, but rather that writing will be an instructional  focus for the teacher. Examples of these interventions include guided reading groups, individual goals in listening and speaking  for newcomers, and small group work out of the classroom with specialists. Furthermore, we use the results of these  assessments to implement specific interventions for ELLs prior to the NYS exams. To provide additional help with scope and  sequence, the classroom teacher and ELL teacher plan collaboratively to differentiate the curriculum based on linguistic needs  so that it is accessible and engaging for the student. The school is learning a lot of information about ELLs from all assessments  performed.  As previously stated, we can see where certain students are falling behind, and we can see where they are   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47   excelling.  These summative assessments give us an idea of what each student is capable of.  This data helps all teachers to  plan and create different lessons with appropriate amounts of differentiation and scaffolding to help the ELL population be  successful.        5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   With the multiple means of data that we are able to collect from the EDAT, tests including the NYSESLAT, NYSITELL and other  assessments such as running records and baseline assessments, we are able to identify which English Language Learners need  additional language support and in which areas this support is needed.  As is aligned with the RtI framework, teachers are able  to determine whether or not students are benefiting from the instructional program within a reasonable time frame. Teachers  are then able to build more targeted instructional programs for students who are not benefiting, as they will be able to see in  what specific areas the child needs additional support. This approach to RtI will also help the ELL teacher design more effective  individualized plans for different students that is tailored to their individual needs.  Also, the classroom teacher and ELL  teacher collaboratively assess the student and compare notes and observations to provide a clearer and holistic picture of the  student.  With the additional information and attention to detail, there will be a greater potential for effective instructional  techniques to support academically at-risk ELLs.  If the classroom teacher and the ELL teacher agree there is need for further  evaluation for a student who is not performing or growing as expected, additional interventions will take place through our  PPT process. This process starts by introducing the student's case to a group of interventionists and related service providers.  This group works with the ELL and classroom teachers to support the ELL student, starting with in-class interventions and then  outside support from a specialist if necessary. Along with the RtI framework, teachers take into account how long the child has  been speaking English and the level of literacy the child has in the first language. The PPT committee, which includes  administrators, SETTS teachers, and other interventionists, helps to monitor students who receive additional at-risk support to  see what progress the student makes and how to best support the child. If the ELL still does not make the expected progress,  the PPT committee may suggest a bilingual evaluation if the ELL is suspected of having a disability.        6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   We use several end of year assessments, such as the NYSESLAT, ELA and Math tests, to evaluate and inform our ENL program.  By looking at the NYSESLAT results over the course of several years using the RLAT and EDAT reports, certain information is  revealed by the data patterns across proficiency levels and grades.   Our Kindergarten students represent all proficiency levels.  Students who had been at the school for more than a year were mostly expanding, with only one transitioning. Typically,  the NYSITELL shows that newly registered students in upper grades are entering or emerging levels.  There is a gradual  increase in proficiency from emerging to expanding students across all grades. Using the state ELA and Math tests, we noted  our only upper grade ELL (an expanding level student) has an IEP. We used this information along with the ELA and Math  scores to inform how to best support this student with test taking and comprehension strategies. We also look at which  teachers predominately work with the ELL population in the school and the trends the students have in their English  proficiency growth. The ELL teacher works with these teachers in particular to help scaffold the curriculum to address the  English proficiency needs of the ELLs.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Our ELL program continues to make ongoing adjustments based on the findings from outcome assessments. As an example,  when looking at the NYSESLAT scores from last year, we noticed the weakest areas for the ELL students was writing and  listening, which revealed that the ENL curriculum will incorporate a program targeted specifically towards writing skills and  building listening stamina and comprehension skills.  The strongest area was the speaking and reading, which shows that  students are able to communicate and understand English input when they are given the passage to read. We disseminate  these findings through several facets, including one on one meetings with teachers, curriculum planning days and professional  development time. Our goal is to ensure all staff working with ELLs are able to understand the needs of our ELL population and  make appropriate adjustments to meet these needs.                  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48       Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   At PS 234 we align all ELL programs with the comprehensive core curriculum. The ELL teacher, the principal, and other  staff members are continuously working to develop a schedule for ELL students in each grade and proficiency level  that is compliant with the CR Part 154 regulations. The ELL teacher works collaboratively with classroom teachers to  ensure the students are getting the most out of their small groups during both standalone and integrated ENL.  For integrated ENL, the ELL teachers works in the classroom for the mandated number of minutes. The classroom and  ENL teachers work together to identify best practices for teaching methods, instructional decisions and texts that tie  into a thematic unit that the class is studying.  In the integrated model, students are grouped in mixed proficiency  levels and the ELL teachers scaffold the content to target the English acquisition needs of the ELLs in the classroom.  The standalone ENL program is provided through a small group model for students who are entering and emerging.  The ELL teacher works out of the classroom with these students and targets basic English language skills to help them  be successful in both academic and social settings. The program model that we have at PS 234 is a mix of  heterogeneous and homogenous students.  We group by skill level as well as grade level.  For example if there is a 4th  grader whose proficiency level is lower than that of the other 4th graders but the same as the 3rd graders, that  student would be placed with the 3rd grade group. Our goal is to find the right balance for our ELLs with regards to  their second language development and age appropriate content.         The ELL program is built around the four essential skills students must acquire: listening, speaking, reading and  writing.  The ENL instruction is content-based in both the standalone and integrated models. The content, materials  and lessons are adapted to meet each student’s needs and provide scaffolding for language. The ELL teacher utilizes  differentiated teaching methods to ensure the success of each individual student at his or her level.  There is a strong  emphasis on literacy work, following a balanced language approach in the workshop model.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     We do not have this program.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?           Students are served with the mandated number of minutes according to proficiency level in the ENL model.  The transitioning  and expanding students are served with 4 periods of 45 minutes of ENL per week for a total of 180 minutes per week.  The  entering and emerging levels have 8 periods, or 360 minutes, a week. Entering, emerging, and transitioning students receive  an equal distribution of time in a standalone model and an integrated model of ENL. The focus for expanding students is  exclusively in the integrated model, as per the mandated services set forth by CR Part 154. The ELL teacher  shares NYSESLAT data with classroom teachers to ensure that all ELLs are receiving the mandated number of ENL minutes.      a. ENL instruction is given to the students on two levels. On the entering and emerging levels, PS 234 provides 360 minutes of  explicit instruction per week.  This is completed with 180 minutes of integrated ENL and 180 minutes of ENL in the standalone  model. During this time, ELLs focus on ELA content to ensure mandated minutes of ELA are provided. On the transitioning and  expanding levels, explicit instruction is provided 180 minutes per week.  For transitioning students, 90 minutes is provided in  the integrated model and the other 90 minutes may be provided either in the standalone or integrated model based on the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49      student’s need. For expanding students, the 180 minutes is provided in the integrated model in ELA classes that total at least  400 explicit reading and writing instruction a week or science classes that total 90 minutes per week. We provide HLA  instructional minutes through the use of bilingual books in the class libraries, bilingual glossaries and dictionaries, and by  allowing students who speak the same home language to translate for one another.         3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   We only offer an ENL program model. In that model the ELA, math, social studies, science and ENL content delivered is a  mixture of heterogeneous and homogeneous levels, based on both the grade and proficiency level of the student. Provided  entirely in English, this content is complemented by the balanced literacy model, which is aligned with the Common Core  Learning Standards. Each of the content areas is made comprehensible by differentiating instruction for each of our students,  providing different levels of scaffolding based on language proficiency and literacy instruction in the content areas. A variety of  resources are utilized, such as native language books, content area books and manipulatives to support the comprehensible  input provided to ELL students. The ENL teacher works with classroom teachers to streamline the work and help ELL students  foster their language development while accessing the grade level content. The ENL teacher also helps classroom teachers  modify and scaffold instructional approaches and methods to make content comprehensible while still addressing the  demands of NYS Learning Standards. Some examples of these modifications include content area vocabulary webs, picture  webs, and wordless books or movies. To provide this targeted content and language instruction, the classroom and ELL  teachers use both small and large group instruction. For expanding ELLs in upper grades, we focus on using expanded English  language to address standards that focus on inferencing skills and creating connections between texts. For entering, emerging  and transitioning ELLs, there is inferencing work but also a lot of focus on key detail standards to help build basic English  vocabulary to talk about reading and writing. In order to address math standards, the ELL teacher works with classroom  teachers to help build the essential vocabulary that is needed to describe and compare attributes and work through word  problems.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   We constantly seek to find ways to assess our ELLs in their home language throughout the year. At this time, we haven’t found  an appropriate way to assess students, as we have several low incidence languages. However, we use translators or school  personnel to assist with evaluations.  If we are referring an ELL student to have related services such as SETTS or speech, we  request a bilingual evaluation for the student.  If any of the standardized tests are available in a student's native language, we  make sure to make that language an option for the student. If a translated version is not available, we hire a translator for the  standardized tests that mandate native language assistance (NYS Math and Science exams). If any further investigation in the  home or native language is needed, we have a translator come in to assist with whatever information we are trying to collect.  Students are also provided opportunities to access information in their native language through books and certain online  resources such as Raz-Kids. We also use peers of their native language to help engage newer ELLs with the curriculum.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Instruction and intervention within the ELL subgroups is differentiated, depending on the fluency levels of the students.  We  try to pair the students with similar fluency peers, but this is not always the case.  In some cases, we may provide one student  with enriched text, and another student with a controlled text, as in the Wilson Reading System, in the reading section.  Other  times worksheets may be adjusted according to skill level.        a. PS 234 does not currently have any SIFE students, which indicates there is currently no program model in effect for those  students.  If we were to receive a SIFE student, we would provide the student with the oral questionnaire, the Multilingual   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      Literacy SIFE screener and a written screener. If these tools indicated the newly enrolled ELL is a SIFE, we would place the  student in an appropriate age range and have them in the group that best suits their needs.  Appropriate scaffolding  techniques would be applied that would differentiate the curriculum in an accessible way. We would also provide small group  instruction in order to ensure the student solidifies the academic foundation needed to ground the more advanced academic  work being done in the classroom.      b. Our plan for newcomer ELLs in the US less than 3 years involves a lot of vocabulary-based lessons, as well as grammatically- enriched lessons.  With the newcomers, generally the vocabulary range is our strongest focus, paired with picture books. With  the transitioning and expanding newcomers, we usually work on sentence syntax and the grammar rules, as well as reading  comprehension. We support these learners in a variety of content areas, including social studies and mathematics, scaffolding  their learning through previewing, explaining concepts and ideas to peers and teachers, as well as manipulatives and other  hands-on materials.                  c.  For the developing ELLs who have been in the US for over 4 years, the lessons are very different than the ones for  newcomers.  These ELLs work mostly on reading and reading comprehension as well as essay writing and general writing and  editing. We support these learners in a variety of content areas, including social studies and mathematics, scaffolding their  learning through previewing, explaining concepts and ideas to peers and teachers, as well as manipulatives and other hands- on materials.      d. At PS 234 we do not currently have any students who have been here for over 6 years, so there is no program in  place.  However if we did have such students, the program would be based upon an intensive study created using  the NYSESLAT score reflecting areas of weakness.  If one student keeps getting low scores in writing, the ENL and classroom  teacher would focus on writing strategies that foster language development for this student. For ELLs who have special needs,  lessons are tailored according to the individual student's specific needs and the goals of the IEP.                   e. The ELL students who have exited the ENL program within the last 2 years do receive additional support from the  ENL teacher. As mandated by the regulations in CR Part 154, the ENL teachers provides 90 minutes of services using the  integrated ENL model. Students in 1st and 2nd grade receive integrated ENL in science twice a week. For older students, the  ENL teacher will choose how to focus instructional efforts depending on how the student exited the ELL program. For students  who exited ELL status by achieving a commanding score on the NYSESLAT, the ENL teacher will provide integrated services in  the content area in which the student needs the most support. For students who exited ELL status by achieving a 3 on the ELA  test and an expanding score on the NYSESLAT, the ENL teacher will provide support in the language modality that was the  weakest for the student on the NYSESLAT, as well as support in math.    These students are also provided with ELL testing modifications as deemed necessary, including extended time and separate  location on all standardized state tests, as well as the opportunity to use a bilingual dictionary if needed. The ENL teacher and  the classroom teachers have an ongoing dialogue throughout the year to monitor students’ progress and testing needs.     Former ELLs at times need to be screened further to determine whether or not they have special needs, like help in reading or  math outside of being former ELLs.  The math coach will assess students who are struggling with the math concepts, and the  reading and literacy coaches will assess ELLs and former ELLs to determine if they should be receiving additional services in  these areas as well as ENL.  If they are deemed eligible by the interventionists, then they will have AIS to serve their needs in  either, or in some cases both areas. The ELL teacher always works with the current teacher of her former ELL to discuss  possible at-risk services.        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Instructional strategies and grade level materials that teachers use with ELL-SWD's provide access to academic content areas  and accelerate English language development.  The ELL teacher works collaboratively with the classroom and special education  teachers to ensure appropriate and relevant context related texts are used to support content area knowledge and accelerate   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51      English language development.  For example, if the class is doing a unit on the American Revolution, the ELL teacher picks out  texts that exemplify the content goals of the study, but in a clearer, simpler way.   By utilizing non-controlled, simpler texts the  ELL teacher scaffolds the content to ensure that the students understand what his/her classroom peers are learning, but on a  level of English they can understand. Teachers use both small group and whole classroom instruction to teach both content  and model correct English. Small groups provide the opportunity to model English grammar and vocabulary to ELLs through  shared writing and reading activities. Whole group activities offer ELLs the opportunity to listen to native English speakers in  activities such as turn and talks. The ELL teacher also provides an account on Raz-Kids that scaffolds reading instruction to the  student's individual reading level. This technology is an excellent resource for our ELL population that provides access to  content, while building on language skills in an interactive and engaging way.     Our classroom teachers preview and review any new vocabulary so that the ELL-SWDs are able to access the lesson. The  students are given word banks during read aloud, social studies and math lessons in order to know what words to listen for as  they attend to the lesson. The teachers have students read aloud short texts in partnerships and stop at parts to talk about the  information. Classes have a word study period in which the ELLs, including ELL-SWDs, receive targeted instruction on letter- sound recognition, spelling rules and patterns to support their encoding and decoding.  ELL-SWDs have access to grade level  materials: the students are given math materials according to their grade and the materials are modified if necessary, the  students have a read aloud period and the text read is leveled for their grade and students use mentor texts from authors or  their peers to understand what a grade level writing piece looks like.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Our school uses curricular, instructional and scheduling flexibility to meet the diverse needs of ELL-SWDs within the least  restrictive environment.  Teachers group students according to age, proficiency level and areas of need. The goal is always to  provide students with the instruction they need in order to accelerate their English language development in tandem with  meeting the goals of the IEP.  Therefore, the ELL teacher works with clinicians, classroom teacher and SETTS teachers to help  create language goals that support the academic work to meet the IEP goals. ALL ELL-SWDs are benefiting from targeted work,  such as Wilson word work, to help meet their academic needs while continuing to build knowledge of English vocabulary and  letter work. All intervention services are provided in English.     The teacher's instruction is flexible based on the students’ needs. Therefore, students are broken up into small groups to  receive instruction based on their goals. Teachers look at the student's’ work based alongside the standards and a reading and  writing continuum to outline the skills a student needs support in and then creates a small group based on those skills. In  math, students are broken up into groups to receive targeting instruction in an area of need.    The schedule is flexible throughout the school. Teachers work with service providers to create a schedule to meet with the  service provider to plan and also to agree upon times when the service provider can work with the students. Schedules change  based on outside programs that come into the school for a period of time and the teachers and service providers work  together to revise the schedule when necessary. In order to ensure ELL-SWDs are scheduled in the least restrictive  environment, ELL-SWDs partake in all school activities and specials with general education students. In order to ensure ELL- SWDs are scheduled in the least restrictive environment, ELL-SWDs partake in all school activities and specials with general  education students.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  We offer targeted intervention programs for ELLs who need additional academic support outside of the ENL program. These  programs are offered solely in English. We identify ELLs who would benefit from these programs by looking at the data  supplied by the EDAT and through our PPT process. Our PPT group meets on a weekly basis to ensure we can quickly identify  which ELLs could benefit from intervention programs and which program would be to their benefit. Such programs include at- risk small group work with a particular focus on reading and/or phonics work. These intervention groups are conducted in  cycles. These groups target expanding ELLs in the higher grades to help them achieve a commanding level of English   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      proficiency by either scoring commanding on the NYSESLAT or receiving a 3 on the ELA and expanding on  the NYSESLAT.  Additionally, speech teachers offer small group work focused on phonics for at-risk students, including at-risk  ELLs, in Kindergarten. These groups target ELLs of all proficiency levels. Teachers monitor progress on a monthly basis to  determine whether or not the ELL still needs the intervention work as an extra support. Assessment tools include running  records, anecdotal and conferencing notes, and summative assessments. The guidance counselor also offers at risk social- emotional support for ELLs. This intervention work is done in small groups and may be done with monolingual English speaking  peers.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      To support our ELL program and maintain compliance, PS 234 has encouraged teachers to get their ENL extension. With this  support, we now have an additional teacher who is able to help provide mandated ELL services to our students through the  science curriculum and standalone ENL.  The integrated ENL model will continue to evolve as a much bigger part of the ENL  program at PS 234. This will require even more collaboration amongst the classroom and ENL teachers to ensure the  integrated ENL program is a success and a meaningful learning opportunity for the ELL population. We also have a trend of  more students registering in the lower grades. Therefore, the ELL teacher will be targeting the PD time to support teachers  working with younger ELLs.  Furthermore, we will determine whether we will continue the use of the  Wilson Fundations program that is currently weaved into the ENL program, as the program is currently implemented by all the  classrooms. This will eliminate redundancy, while freeing up additional instructional time to focus more on the specific needs  of the ELL students. The data that supports this potential move is the repetitive nature in the Wilson reading system.  Wilson is  a very strictly formulated curriculum, and with the implementation of this reading system into the classroom, the ENL program  may need to change or work around what's being done in the classroom in order to provide maximum opportunity for learner  growth.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We have not had a bilingual program; not applicable to PS 234     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELL students have full access to and are using all school programs, including the music curriculum and after school programs,  which are held inside of the school building.  They also have access to after school programs that are held next door at the  Manhattan Youth Center. There are also enrichment programs such as the French Club and the track team that all ELLs may  join. These programs are provided to students through fair student funding and Children's First Funds.  PS 234 does not receive  Title III funds due to the number of ELL students in the building. However, we have used the Title III immigrant funds to invite  immigrant ELLs to an afterschool program that focused on literacy work and invited the immigrant ELLs and their parents to  the Broadway show, Aladdin.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  A variety of differentiated instructional materials are utilized within the ENL program. The students have access to a wide  variety of reading materials that are appropriate for ELLs' age, interest level and English proficiency. These reading materials  come from classroom libraries, the school library, as well as the ENL library geared towards specific languages and cultures. In  addition, specific programmatic texts tailored to the ELL population are used. For example, the school word study curriculum,  FUNdations/Wilson, is modified to fit the specific learning needs of the students.  The general education and ELL classrooms  also utilize a variety of technology, such as iPads, videos, and electronic books to scaffold instruction and engage students in  lessons. ELL students receive a Raz-Kids account that provides online texts that engage readers, while modeling new  vocabulary and reading strategies. Brainpop Jr. is also a technological resource used to teach ELLs both content and language.  This website teaches core content, while allowing ELLs to become acclimated to idiomatic English.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   We provide HLA instructional minutes through the use of bilingual books in the class libraries, bilingual glossaries and  dictionaries, and by allowing students who speak the same home language to translate for one another. Additionally, many  classrooms invite ELLs to label parts of the room in their home language or create their own bilingual dictionary to support  content vocabulary being taught. Some classes invite parents in for special presentations that share part of the culture.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    To support age, grade and proficiency levels of the ELL students, we align our material and instructional resources to meet  their needs. There is a constant collaboration between the classroom and ELL teachers so that there is a consistency of  message and content. Administrators and coaches work alongside the teachers to help streamline these academic and  linguistic supports. Our goal is to ensure students can actively participate in their classroom lessons at an appropriate linguistic  level. For example, a 5th grade beginning English Language Learner will be matched with subject texts that would interest a 10  year old, while meeting the language needs of the same student by providing simpler texts. We choose books and writing  activities based upon age and grade level, as well as proficiency.  As an example, the Kindergarten ENL class will have a study  unit on the five senses, while a third grade group will study differences in cultural celebrations.  Both lessons can be adapted to  suit different proficiency levels, while also providing appropriate and important core curriculum material from each grade  level.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    We do not share a building with another school.      16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Due to the comprehensive nature of our ENL program, we need to be proactive in contacting and informing ELL students and  families who will be attending PS 234. Our office and ELL teacher identify new ELL students during the registration process in  order to afford both the student and family additional information and support through the resources available to the parent  coordinator. Official documents and information about the school is available in a variety of translated languages. The parent  coordinator, guidance counselor and ENL teacher want to ensure our new ELLs feel safe, secure and welcomed. We invite all  newly enrolled Kindergarten ELLs to a “Taste of Kindergarten” before school starts. During this time, new ELLs see a  Kindergarten classroom and meet new teachers. The ENL teacher and parent coordinator may establish family ambassadors as  well. These volunteers will be a resource for the both ELL students and families to better understand the school and  neighborhood.  What we would like is for our newly enrolled ELLs to feel a sense of community here at PS 234. Helping to  foster this community could lead to helping new ELLs find friends. It can help push the children to speak English together if  they do not have the same native language, or it can provide a comfort level to one another if they share the same home  language.       17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    French club is available after school to all ELLs who would like to join, K-5      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?  Not applicable to PS 234        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      Staff development is important for teachers of ELLs at our school. The ELL teacher and any other teacher who would like to  participate take advantage of opportunities like the NYS TESOL conferences, small ELL study groups offered within the district  and other related workshops. Additionally, the ELL teacher attends professional development days that are focused on using  Raz-Plus for ELLs, which is facilitated through the DELLSS office. Through these professional development days, the ELL teacher  can stay informed about successful techniques and assessments. It is also a great way to become familiar with new  publications and professional development resources. The ELL teacher is then able to turnkey the information to both teachers  of ELLs, as well as the administration to ensure we take the necessary steps to follow compliance regulations.  She provides PD  to staff on how to scaffold instruction for ELLs, how to meet mandates, and how to access resources that improve instruction  and communication with parents.  Additionally, the guidance counselor attends professional development on students in  transition.     There is professional development for teachers and non-pedagogic staff who work with ELLs. Teachers are given important  information, including testing accommodations and ways to provide scaffolding and differentiated instruction to ELLs. Topics  for the professional development include: ELLs’ similarities and differences with students with disabilities, cultural sensitivity  when working both with ELLs and their families, Language Access Coordinator training for translation and interpretation  resources. Other examples of topics that may be included are how to work with newcomers in the classroom, supporting  different content areas with newcomers, and also ELLs with special needs. For some of these professional developments,  articles selected by the ELL teacher and the administration are handed out that highlight an awareness of ELLs, methods and  strategies for dealing with having an ELL in your classroom and other related topics.  At staff meetings readings are discussed  and analyzed.  Included in the staff meetings are APs, classroom teachers, the literacy coach, cluster teachers,  paraprofessionals, at-risk teachers, speech and language teachers, OT/PTs, the Parent Coordinator, guidance counselors, the  special ed and ICT teachers, the psychologists and also all coordinators.  Grade meetings across the year are devoted to helping  teachers support ELLs in their classrooms. Specific strategies teachers can use in their daily instruction are shared. We also  plan to begin using lunch sessions as part of teachers’ professional development.     Projected Schedule:  October 2, 3 - TCRWP Adapting Units of Study for English Language Learners  October 14 - UFT ELL Conference  November 7 - TCRWP ELL Toolkit  October 19, November 29, January 17, March 8 - ELL Leads Meeting with Paula Waldron     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  There is a minimum of 15% of total professional development hours for ELL training for all staff and 50% of total hours for the  ENL teacher.  We have records to maintain these requirements that have been met that are located in the ELL office. These  records include agendas from meetings. During the professional development days, when students are not in attendance, and  during Monday afternoons that are designated for professional development, there is a certain amount of time allotted on site  for ENL information and training. This can last between one to two hours, depending on the session.  We also are starting  shorter lunch time sessions to cover a smaller range topic and allow teachers the opportunity to ask the ENL teacher specific  questions concerning best practices for the ELLs in their classroom. Over the course of a teacher’s 100 hours of professional  development, we will have met or exceeded the 15% assigned to ELL training. Some of the training may come from the ELL  teacher from network meetings, and some of may come from other ELL specialists or the LAC. The ENL teacher will also use  portions of the weekly time devoted to professional development to help show best practices for ELL students and how to  integrate these practices into the classroom. She will also use the time to inform the faculty and staff of updated regulations  that affect the ELLs in their classroom.     The ENL teacher also documents professional development that is ELL-specific professional development. Records of these  meetings are kept in the ELL Binder in the ELL office. When the ENL teacher provides the professional development on site, she  does not receive hours towards her 50%. Most of the ENL teacher’s professional development devoted to ELL-specific topics   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55         are done off site; these predominantly take place with the Manhattan ELL Field Support Staff and the DELLSS office.      Projected Schedule:  October 2, 3 - TCRWP Adapting Units of Study for English Language Learners  October 14 - UFT ELL Conference  November 7 - TCRWP ELL Toolkit  October 19, November 29, January 17, March 8 - ELL Leads Meeting with Paula Waldron       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   In addition to the parent orientation meetings and the DOE scheduled parent-teacher conferences throughout the year, PS 234  also provides individual meetings with the parents of ELLs under the CR Part 154 regulations. The ELL teachers are responsible  for scheduling and conducting these meetings. These meetings are typically held before or after school hours. The ELL teacher  invites the parents in via phone or email in their preferred language. If parents are not available to come in, the ELL teacher  offers an over-the-phone opportunity to speak about the ELL student's progress. During these meetings, the ELL teacher and  parents meet to discuss the language assessment results and goals for the individual student, or students in the case of  siblings. The ELL teacher shares the results of the latest NYSESLAT or NYSITELL exam and what the English language proficiency  goals are for the student. These goals take into account the four English literacy skills: speaking, listening, reading and writing.  In addition, the ELL teacher communicates a classroom goal for the child that is based on content being taught in the  classroom in tandem with the ENL program. In addition to explaining the goals for the student, the ELL teacher also uses this  time to elaborate more on the ENL curriculum and how she will help the student reach or exceed those goals. The ELL teacher  is responsible for recording the date of these meetings and taking notes of what was discussed. These records can be found in  the ELL compliance binder in the ELL office. Additionally, all other meetings are recorded, including face-to-face interactions  and phone calls. Copies of letters sent home by the ELL teacher can also be located in the ELL compliance binder and in student  cumulative folders. These include mandated letters as well as informational letters written by the ELL teacher. These records  demonstrate that PS 234 meets the needs of parents to feel accommodated and involved in their child’s learning.        In order to address the interpretation and translation needs of the parents, appointments are made for translators if they are  needed. The parent coordinator and ENL teacher have a running file on all present and previous PS 234 parents and contacts  that speak other languages, and their contact information as it is needed.  These volunteers are useful with both written  translation and oral interpretation.  In addition, we utilize the NYCDOE phone translation service and conduct a parent-teacher  conference utilizing this method, when low-incidence languages are involved.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  The parent involvement level at PS 234 is extremely high all around, and we are constantly working to involve the ELL parents  even more. All ELL parents are invited to and participate in classroom celebrations after finishing a lengthy study, field trips,  and PTA meetings. PS 234 also uses part of parent engagement time to connect with parents either in person or though email  or phone. Several parents of ELLs are highly active.  There are a few who are PTA members and a few who volunteer their time  occasionally to help at school.  At the ELL Parent Orientation meeting at the beginning of the year, many parents had  conversations and exchanged numbers so they may be in contact with each other as well. In order to ensure that ELL parents  know of all of these opportunities, PS 234 ensures that parents receive notification of the above mentioned activities via  backpacked letters home and the school website.  These letters are translated into the preferred home language and  interpretation is used when meeting face to face.            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.    We are very proud of the ELL program at PS 234. In addition to the academic work being done with the ENL and classroom  teachers, ELLs also carry various roles within our community. As an example, ELLs serve as buddies between grades. This is a  wonderful partnership that different classrooms create amongst themselves.    The ENL program also has a showcase for holidays from the countries ELLs represent. The ENL teacher invites parents and ELLs to  send in information and pictures of a special holiday from their home country. The ELLs then create a beautiful and interactive  project that is displayed.    PS 234 has also diligently worked to streamline the registration process to ensure that we correctly identify students who need to  be screened with the NYSITELL. The parent coordinator, pupil account secretary, administrators, and ELL teacher work together to  complete the HLIS form with parents and conduct the interview with the student. Streamlining this process has helped the PS 234  community at large better understand the identification and language needs of both ELL students and parents.    Finally, our ENL teacher has worked to create a community of ENL teachers within the district. She organizes times outside of  school where several ENL teachers meet together to discuss compliance issues and best practices. Cultivating this community of  ENL teachers has helped our own ELL program, as the ELL teacher is then able to bring the information back and turnkey it to the  administration and classroom teachers.                          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.                     In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Lisa Ripperger, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PS 234, Independence School                                                                              School DBN: 02M234  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

Yes/No    Magda    Lenski   Parent Coordinator   Yes   Yes          * The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs  on translation,   interpretation, compliance and budget.      School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      The language preferences and needs of the parents at P.S. 234 are identified using a variety of methods during  interactions with parents. During registration, the ELL teacher and parent coordinator go through the HLIS with all  new registrants. At this time, we ask families what their preferred language of oral and written communication is  and put this information in Part III of the HLIS form. If needed, a translated version of the HLIS form or an  interpreter are made available to help complete the form at the time of registration. Additionally ATS reports  including RCPL and RAPL are consulted for parents’ preferred language of communication. We also use student  emergency contact cards to have updated preferred languages on a yearly basis. All staff have access to these  emergency cards so that every person knows which families need translated documents or an interpreter for face  to face or phone conversations.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60     2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     Language    Written  Preferred    Percent  Written    Oral Preferred    Percent Oral    English   Spanish           1127   2   99.56   .35   1127   2   99.56   .35   3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.     At this time, we do not have any languages other than English that represent at least 10% of our population.          Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services    1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be   distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.      Document Name    Month/Frequency   How do you   Distributed to   Families    Report Cards   January, June   plan to   translate?   Include   procedures to  ensure timely  provision of  translated   documents to   parents.    We ensure  teachers  complete  report cards  early for  students  whose family’s  preferred  language of  written  communication  is not English.  The report  cards are then  sent to a  vendor for  translation.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61             2.  List the formal face-to-face meetings your school will typically have with parents throughout the school year, such as   parent-teacher   conferences or curriculum nights, when they will occur, and plans to provide interpretation at those meetings.        Meeting Name    Month/Frequency of Meetings    How does your school plan to   Curriculum Night   September   Parent/Teacher conferences   November, March   IEP meetings   Ongoing   ELL Orientation   September   provide interpretation service(s)?    We may use a variety of resources to  provide interpretation services.  Typically, we use Language Line and  call in for an interpreter. This service  has worked well for us historically.  Also, we may hire an interpreter  through a vendor, in which case we  would schedule the interpreter  several weeks in advance or over the  summer. We may pay a staff member  per session to serve as an interpreter  for meetings held outside school  hours.    We may use a variety of resources to  provide interpretation services.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      As we have few families that are limited-English-proficient, we are able to have a plan in place to reach these families  in the event of a school emergency. If there is a school emergency, school personnel are able to use Language Line to  call families in their preferred language of communication. All school personnel are given the number for Language  Line and, therefore, are able to quickly dial the number and request a three-way call to contact families. This plan  provides us with immediate access to reaching the family in their preferred language of communication.            Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      All staff members are made aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and of the resources that are available  to meet compliance. The LAC attends a training and turnkeys the information to the staff. Throughout the year, the  LAC and ELL teacher work together to disseminate this information both in the weekly emails all staff receive and in  Monday PD time. All staff receive information on how to call Language Line to use for either face-to-face meetings or  phone calls. Additionally, all staff are made aware of the need to have documents made early in order to  accommodate the time needed for a vendor to translate the document. The principal will consider bringing in the  district Manhattan Field Language Access Coordinator for further training.           Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      Parents are made aware of their rights regarding translation and interpretation services and how they may obtain  these services. We use the information provided in the LAC kit to assist in this effort. We hang up the language poster  and have brochures in several languages both in the main office and ELL office. These signs are there to help parents  know of the services we offer. Parents may also be made aware of these rights during meetings with school staff, i.e.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63      conferences, IEP meetings, etc. Our school’s safety plan will contain procedures for ensuring that parents in need of  language access services are not prevented from reaching the school’s administrative offices solely due to language  barriers.             Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       PS 234 will gather feedback on the quality and availability of services in a variety of ways. One way will be conducted  informally when using translation services for face-to-face meetings. The PS 234 staff member will ask if the parent  feels like the translation service we provide is helping facilitate the conversation with ease and clarity. If the parent  feels like that form of translation service works for the face-to-face interactions, we will make note of it and continue  to use that service. If it does not work for the parent, we will use alternative translations services. Another way we will  gather feedback is through a survey to parents who use the translation and interpretation services. We will distribute  a survey to parents who use the translation services or who receive written information that has been translated to  ensure we provide the services that meet the language access needs of our families. The surveys will be provided in  the parent’s preferred language. The surveys will provide us with feedback so that we may ensure PS 234  accommodates the language needs of our families.             2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64
