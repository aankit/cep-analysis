This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Our mission is to build the capacity of our community members to exercise self-determination and leadership. We  believe that all students have the right to be exposed to high quality academic content as well as life experiences that  promote self-determination and prepare young people to become leaders. We understand self-determination as the  ability to make conscious and positive choices about one's life path and put together a plan conducive to achieving  one's goals. We understand leadership as the ability to not only impact one's own life in positive ways but also the  lives of others, be they family, peers or the broader community.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      At HSCL we strive to expose all of our students to a quality education centered on foundational skills and rich core  content as well as new forms of knowledge that reflect the demands of the future. We also place significant emphasis  on positive life experiences that promote inquiry, collaboration and imagination. We believe that the combination of  formal, academic knowledge and rich life experiences is essential to the development of well-rounded, culturally  competent and progressive thinking citizens.          2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    The High School for Community Leadership was founded in 2010. Its mission was to serve a student population that  did not historically achieve academic success by creating a supportive environment and implementing an innovative  design approach to programming. Our school design includes a multitude of supports for students and teachers as  well as a non-traditional programming model that allows students to focus on fewer core subjects at one time as well  as combining related fields of study to achieve greater curricular coherence. In addition to programmatic innovations,  we are guided by the principle that student achievement results can be improved by organizing teachers to work in  teams and reducing the total student load (TSL) for each instructor. Over the course of seven years, these innovations  have allowed our school to have an impressive impact on student achievement. At present, we rank among the top  NYC public schools with the greatest impact on closing the achievement gap reflected in the Performance Dashboard.      At The High School for Community Leadership, our mission and vision combine the following core values:      SELF-DETERMINATION   We promote self-determination by emphasizing a rich and rigorous curriculum accessible to all of our students,  regardless of previous academic history, family background or any other factor that has been used to historically deny  students opportunities to reach their academic potential. We actively promote an academic culture in which the  successful pursuit of post secondary schooling or a well-conceived career path is expected. In this way, our standard  for students extends beyond merely graduating from high school to the ability to develop positive life goals and  develop a path leading to the realization of said goals.      LEADERSHIP   Authentic leadership requires many attributes as well as the ability to correctly combine skills. There can be no  leadership without the ability to COLLABORATE. As such, we promote a culture of collaboration for students within  classes in the form of group learning and projects as well as outside of the classroom through a myriad of student  clubs and organizations that maintain a high degree of autonomy. This culture extends to teachers through the  structuring of dynamic teams of pedagogues that play a central role in developing programs and providing supports  for all learners. Teachers exercise leadership in implementing organizational and programmatic modifications to allow  us to more effectively carry out our mission.      Leadership also requires EMPATHY and CULTURAL COMPETENCE. We strive to promote these attributes through the  integration of social and emotional supports for both students and teachers. Our students have advisory classes in  accordance with developmental/grade needs as well as a series of other group supports (e.g. Immigrant youth, Gay   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Straight Alliance, Multicultural clubs, National Honor Society) to meet the needs of a diverse population and promote  healthy interactions between community members of different backgrounds.       Leaders also possess the ability to THINK STRATEGICALLY and COMMUNICATE EFFECTIVELY. We work actively with  our students to develop their capacity to both develop coherent plans while in school and for life beyond high school.  Additionally, we place great emphasis in all forms of communication, including a rigorous writing program as well as  opportunities for young people to discuss and debate their ideas related to topics important to them both in class and  within the community at large.      At HSCL, we have strategically partnered with such institutions as St. John’s University, Syracuse University, New York  University and Monroe College as well as the Abrons Art Center/Henry Street Settlement's Exploring the Arts  Program. We also partner with Grace Episcopal Church and The Queens Library to provide our students with  opportunities for volunteering on behalf of the needy, engaging in innovative learning opportunities and leadership- building experiences. Through these partnerships, our students and families are able to access college level  coursework and instructors in a variety of disciplines. Our students also have multiple opportunities to engage in  service projects within southeast Queens.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   With respect to special needs populations, we have exceeded student achievement rates for ELLs (15% of population)  and SWD (16% of population) students viz-a-viz borough averages and comparison schools. We continue to work hard  to provide challenging materials/tasks along with the additional support to these populations. All ELL and SWD have  access to the general curriculum and are expected to take upper level math and science courses as well as ELA/AP  English. ELL and SWD take these courses with significant supports within an ICT setting to address specific learning  and language issues. Research indicates that ELL and SWD students do not thrive in isolated settings such as Self- contained classrooms or ESL programs that restrict native language use or interactions between ENL students and  English-speaking peers. As such, we engage in special training for both IEP and ENL teachers so that they can work  effectively in a team teaching setting and support students to access high quality curricula along with General  Education and English-speaking peers with a variety of instructional modifications. We take great pride in extending  all school-wide programs, academic and enrichment to all of our students.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   With regards to the Framework for Great Schools, our school has done well in the areas of Teacher Collaboration  (4/4), Effective School Leadership (4/4), Strong Family-Community Ties (4/4) and Trust (4/4). We attribute this to  developing effective systems for teachers and all shareholders to collaborate and collectively decide on goals as well  as action plans.      Our most recent Quality Review revealed the need to focus on Assessment. To that end, we continue to pursue  additional professional development opportunities and set as grade team and department meeting goals a focus on  improving assessment, both informal and formal.

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     Based on data for 2017-2018, our school achieved a 93% graduation rate with 94% our graduates obtaining admission  to post-secondary institutions. We are among the highest impact schools in the borough (Queens) and the city  according to the Performance Dashboard. This is attributable to our commitment to closing the performance gap of  our incoming 9th grade over the course of four years of high school. Additionally, we continue to show important  gains in New York State assessments (Regents Exams) across all areas, particularly in the college readiness metrics  related to ELA and Math. For the 2017-2018, our graduating class achieved a 26% improvement in our college  readiness level from one year to the next, from 49% for the '16-'17 to 75% during the '17-'18 school year. We have  continuously lowered the gap between the graduation and the College Readiness rate as follows: 53% difference  ('14/'15), 47% difference ('15/'16), 42% difference ('16/'17), 18% difference ('17/'18). Despite these successes, our  students continue to struggle on the SAT exam, which has historically resulted in a lower than desired acceptance rate  for our graduates at top tier post secondary schools. To address this issue, our 2018-2019 goals continue to reflect the  need to improve the overall level of rigorous instruction at our school through multiple opportunities to simulate  college-level academic demands and to bolster the supports necessary to accelerate the academic progress made by  high needs (e.g. ELL, SWD) students. Specific goals include continuing to close the gap between our college readiness  metric and graduation rate in general for the 2018-2019 school year as well as ensuring that we close the  achievement gap between general education and ENL/SWD students.   One critical area in which our school experienced a reversal during the '17-'18 school year was in credit accumulation  for ENL students in their second and third year of high school. Although the overall percentages for credit  accumulation have remained steady (92% grade 9, 90% grade 10, 89% grade 11), we have witnessed an increase in  enrollment of high needs ELL students. This phenomenon defines a clear task we have for the year to come which we  plan to address through a combination of programming changes (e.g. introducing a SIFE program), additional teacher  PD and the development of social emotional supports that target incoming ELL/SIFE students. We also plan on  revising our protocols for acclimating new students and families transferring into our school beyond freshmen year.      Finally, a school-wide focus for this year will be on increasing attendance. We have struggled as a school to achieve  the Chancellor's mandate of 90% attendance. While some of this has been due to the issues faced by many of our  students, we have arrived at the conclusion that many of our internal practices contribute to this. Our current rate of  students with 90% attendance is 54%. This is a drop from last year (60%). We are currently reflecting on our practices  for capturing attendance as well as how we address the issues of students with chronic attendance problems.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  Although our school consistently receives high marks in learning environment surveys for safety and trust from  students and families, our documented percentage of students with outstanding attendance is lagging far behind  similar and borough schools. We see this as a priority given the well-documented relationship between good  attendance at school and academic success. However, we have found that much of the issue we are facing stems from  how are school is designed, we follow a very specific and non-traditional model of bloc classes, and our inability to  develop corresponding processes for recording attendance.   Over the past few years we have made progress and seen steps backwards despite attempting a myriad of strategies.  Last year, we took a critical look at our own internal systems for documenting attendance and found serious gaps. As  a result, we attempted to use a series of new technologies in an effort to streamline processes for teachers to record  student attendance and identify specific groups of students to target for outreach. We also introduced new  procedures at the teacher team level to share responsibility for improving student attendance. What we found,  however, was that instead of streamlining attendance documentation procedures, we actually created new layers of  bureaucracy that had no positive impact on attendance results.   For the current year we have adjusted our approach. We started by looking at what successful schools do at the  administrative level to document attendance and identify specific groups of students to be targeted for interventions.  What we found was that Charter schools in NYC had unlocked the potential for technological solutions that really  could help both classroom teachers and teacher teams address attendance issues. We are currently working with  New Visions staff to develop a customized tool that we anticipate will 1) allow teachers to streamline in-class  processes and 2) allow our attendance team to make real-time interventions for absent students.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.

Strategies to address the needs of  students with disabilities, English  language learners, and other high- need student subgroups (e.g.,  overage/under-credited, SIFE,  STH).   Despite a robust advisory program,  innovative classes and consistently high  scores on learning environment surveys for  trust and feelings of safety among  students, our attendance percentage has  lagged behind comparable schools. As a  result we have analyzed our internal  processes for recording attendance as well  as making interventions.      Our new strategy is based on adopting and  adapting approaches and procedures of  successful schools. To this end we have  made contact with charter schools that  have employed innovative "technical  solutions" to streamline attendance  recording and set up real-time outreach to  students and families that are not present  for school.      Our research led us to the realization that  similar schools within the charter world  were achieving 10+ points above us in  attendance percentage despite not having  the same in-class supports, programming  or achieving the same results in student  satisfaction surveys. The key to their  success was in how they were able to  develop in partnership tools that  streamline the process for teachers so that   Target Group(s)  Who will be targeted?

Said tool allows for  one person to easily and efficiently access  all attendance data in real time and upload  the data sets to automated calling  programs or engage in live calls.  Additionally, these schools are able to  engage in several accountability checks  before recording the final attendance for  the day without wasting time or relying on  several staff members.       We are currently engaged in training  sessions with New Visions tech staff to  create a similar tool, customized for our  school, that will allow us to use Skedula for  in-class attendance and anecdotal reports  without having to also use traditional  bubble sheets for ATS.

Over the past four years, we have consistently closed the gap between graduation rate and college readiness rates.  Additionally, we have done so without significant variances between subgroups (e.g. SWD, AA, Female). The current  gap between graduation rate (93%) and college readiness as reflected on the performance dashboard (75%) is 18  points, down from 53% four years ago.

The Regents exam pathway relies on continuous alignment of  in-class assessments with Regents exams for ELA and all CC  math exams as well as opportunities for seniors to retake  previous exams. Additionally, after school preparation  sessions allow students to retake and prepare for exams.      The SAT pathway relies on contracted services in the area of  SAT preparation provided by Kaplan.      The CUNY assessment pathway relies on the integration of  CUNY Assessment preparation into senior advisory classes  during the Spring semester.      Additionally, all seniors are required to take AP classes as part  of the AP for All initiative.    All SWD and ENL students are included in the pathway  options listed above.

Quality instruction is the essential requisite for student success. This assertion has been repeatedly proven in various  studies. As such, HSCL is committed to continuously improving instruction through high quality professional  development as well as structures that allow for collaboration and the sharing of best practices. Towards the same  end, HSCL also aims to foster a culture of professional excellence. For the 2017-2018 school year, the majority of  teachers at HSCL were rated effective or highly effective in Advance. We had only one new teacher join our staff this  year. As such, we are now engaged in a process of focusing on specific subcategories of teacher practice reflected in  Advance to identify individual areas of growth and strategically pair teachers based on areas of highly effective and  developing practices.      The principal and assistant principal continue to review Advance data and cross reference this with scholarship  reports for students to target areas of instructional focus. For example, current trends in Advance indicate the need to  focus on assessment. We use use aggregate data related to teacher performance in Advance to determine areas of  professional development for staff as a whole. We also use disaggregated data, as stated above, to identify individual  needs of teachers and target our PD interventions. This variety of PD strategies is used to address all of our teachers'  needs. For example, we have recently paired teachers highly effective in assessment with those that are developing in  the same area to leverage existing best practices while developing the leadership potential of our more experiences  and effective teachers. We have also sought out external professional development coaches to assist our teachers  needing support in this area. Our goal is to ensure alignment between teacher-created assessments and standardized  tests such as Regents exams and SAT/ACT tests.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  90% of teachers will achieve an end of year rating of effective or highly effective by September 2019.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  HSCL has developed a recruitment system that utilizes NYCDOE resources (New Teacher Finder) and independently  developed network of local area schools of education (e.g. St. John’s University, Columbia University, Queens College,  CUNY, etc.)    Two times per year HSCL hosts a hiring fair at the school. The dates of these activities are usually around January 30  and April 30. Prospective candidates are vetted in a three stage process: Panel interviews are conducted by teachers  and students using a common rubric aligned to the Danielson framework; in school demo lessons are scheduled for  the corresponding license area with procedures for both student and administrative or teacher evaluation; an  interview with administration is then scheduled. Upon completion of the final stage, candidates are vetted by Human  Resources support from Affinity Field Support to ensure that their credentials meet criteria for highly qualified .        2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   HSCL has formed a Professional Learning Community (PLC) in which whole faculty PD topics are decided upon based  on data reviews. Additionally, each teacher is required to choose an individual area of PD. Administration funds high  quality training to facilitate the particular professional development goals of its faculty. For example, new teachers  have had individual coaching in classroom management, while senior teachers have had leadership training. Specialty  PD offerings have included workshops for English language Learners, SWDs, Advanced Placement training, etc. This  year, our school community has decided to focus on digital literacy. Extensive PD has been facilitated by in house staff  as well as Custom Computer solutions to develop proficiency in Google Drive applications as well as teacher  Dashboard.

Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Continuous surveys are administered to faculty through the Google APPs medium which inform decisions around  various aspects of school life. For example, teachers have collectively decided to pursue PD around how to integrate  culinary education into various traditional subjects (e.g. math, science) which has prompted the contracting of  vendors to provide the corresponding training. Teachers, in consultation with the Principal, also inform the decisions  related to which teacher metrics are used for the local measure component of their Advance rating and which  additional assessments are used for students.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. The High School for Community Leadership, in compliance with the Section  1118 of Title I, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and  implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement  between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving  them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to  actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained  volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   The High School for Community Leadership will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

Of these: 14 are seniors, 22 are juniors,  21 are sophomores, and 12 are freshmen.  Four are from previous graduating classes.  Based on  most recent NYSESLAT data: 13 are Emerging, 10 are entering, 25 are expanding, and 20 are  transitioning.  There is one student currently classified as "non".  Supplemental instruction for ELLs:    Supplemental instruction for is provided after school as well as on Saturday throughout the 2018  - 2019 school year.  In order to provide the additional instruction described below, we have  decided to supplement the Title III funding allocated for Per session with TL funds also allocated  for Per Session and supplies.  Saturday Program  Saturday classes run from late November - mid January for 8 sessions and resume in March to  conclude in May for 8 sessions. Saturday classes meet from 9am - 12pm.   Classes are Native  Language Global History (Spanish) and Native Language as well as ESL.  There will be 2  classes of approximately 15 students each from grades 9-12 in Global History as well as an  additional freestanding ESL class of about 20 students.   Classes are taught by licensed Bilingual  Content Area Teachers as well as licensed ESL teacher during the Saturday Program.  Classes  are 90 minutes long.     After School Program  Additionally, ESL free-standing after school classes are provided by level with a focus  on beginning level students (Entering and Emerging) on Monday and Wednesday for 17 sessions  (1 hour each) throughout the academic year from October to May. Classes meet from 3:30 -  4:30pm. Two licensed ESL teachers (Ms. Lutsky, Ms. Jovel-Barrera)  provide this additional  time on task which focuses on ESL, but also incorporates content support for Algebra and US  History.     Daytime Instruction  ELL instruction in our school is delivered through several models designed to best meet  individual students’ needs. ESL stand-alone classes are designed for student language acquisition  to facilitate them to be mainstreamed into monolingual content classes. In addition to free  standing ESL classes, the beginning level students (Entering and Emerging) receive core content  classes which are taught by ESL teachers using ESL strategies. There is also one section of a  bilingual Global Studies class taught in English/Spanish by a content area teacher (Ms.  Rodriguez). The Collaborative Team Teaching Model, used for the intermediate and the  advanced students, is a model in which a licensed ESL teacher (Flora Lutsky, Roxanna Jovel- Barrera) pushes into content classes in which ELL students are blocked along with monolingual  (English) students, to provide ESL instruction and support.

In addition to adaptive software designed to improve literacy (e.g. IReady) our school also uses  the National Geographic “Edge” series as well as content rich independent readers.  In addition  to QTEL, Best- Practices, and Sheltered Instruction, the strategies that are utilized are as follows:  assisted reading, sight word categories, synonyms match, KWL charts, semantic feature analysis,  previewing target text, segmented text, oral reading prompts, analyzing main concepts, visual  displays, paragraph restatements by summarizing or paraphrasing, meta-comprehension training  on main ideas, pre – paragraph questions, writing before reading, story mapping training,  collaborative learning, identifying and interpreting theme, self questions for main ideas,  reciprocal teaching, story retelling, two column notes, anticipation guides, feature analysis,  verbal – visual associations, and sentence starters.  We currently have a high percentage of ELLs that are newcomers (students with less than 3 years  in the country). These students are supported by materials that focus on content knowledge  acquisition (e.g. translated and bilingual books, dictionaries, software, etc.) as well as ESL  materials that focus on acculturation (e.g. common social interactions). ELL students that have  been the country for either 4 to 6 years, or “long term” ELLs receive instruction modified to  focus on academic language acquisition and formal register.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Instructional planning for ENL students is based on a combination of the following formative assessments: LBR/NYTL date for  incoming students, NYSESLAT, Regents and grade/credit accumulation data for students that have been with us for at least one  year.  At present, we have 17 Entering-level, 19 Emerging-level, 19 Transitioning-level and 20 Expanding-level students (Total  75 ENL students).  We develop plans based on these assessments as well as student progress towards graduation in the field of  Regents pass and credit accumulation as well as informal teacher/ Guidance observations.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   We have established a protocol for ENL and Guidance staff to review assessment data 4 times a year with biweekly check-ins  to monitor student progress.  Students have yearly plans aligned to overall graduation goals and requirements.  Due to the  variety of academic proficiency and rate of progress of our ENL population (e.g. SIFE vs. students with strong L1 skills and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         academic background) these programs are highly individualized.  We attempt to flexibly group students to assist in their  progress based on over progress of ENL students by grade/ENL level and individual considerations.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The success of our program for ELLs is evaluated through an analysis  of the following metrics: credit accumulation by grade,  NYSESLAT and Regents exam results, attendance and participation, both in terms of school attendance and in after school  activities.        4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Periodic assessment of student progress is used to both monitor progress towards proficiency and modify individualized plans  accordingly, and assess th effectiveness of instruction and the plans themselves.  Students that are not meeting progress goals  may be provided additional supports through pull-out sessions with direct instruction or may be further integrated with  English speaking peers depending on the particular issues that are identified.  Through bi-weekly meetings, the effectiveness  of individualized pans are assessed based on student progress (informal assessments, teacher observations, etc.)     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   We are 9 - 12.        6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The distribution of students across the four levels of ENL reflects 52% of students reaching Transitional and Expanding  status.  The other 48% of students (32), 28 of which have been in the US for less than 1 year, are either Entering or  Emerging.  We are currently monitoring ENL progress by looking at the rates of progress (from one level to the next) both by  grade and initial level.  This data is gathered through an analysis of NYSESLAT scores.  Additional assessment data includes  Regents exams and credit accumulation.  A further breakdown of assessment data reveals a typical pattern of lower reading  and writing scores relative to speaking and listening for newer ENLs.  This informs instructional choices as teachers train to  capitalize off of students' strengths in oratory and receptive language skills to foster the development of reading and writing,  particularly with Entering and emerging students.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   As stated previously, regular meeting structures which include ENL, Guidance and core subject-area classroom teachers, allow  for the analysis of data, development of individualized plans, monitoring of progress and adjustments.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Students are grouped by level (e.g. En, EM, TR, CM), students receive a combination of mandated freestanding  instruction and 'push-in' content ENL classes in which the ENL teacher collaborates to deliver direct instruction with  the content area Gen Ed teacher in all core classes.   Entering and Emerging students receive a minimum of 1 period  per day (220 min/wk) of freestanding ENL instruction in which the teacher focuses on core language skills for all four  modalities and foundational social and academic vocabulary development.  These students will also be integrated into   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55         core academic classes with supports such as ENL "push-in"/"pull-out" instruction as well as a variety of technological  supports depending on the degree in which L1 proficiency can be harnessed to foster English  acquisition.  Transitioning and Expanding students receive "push-in" ENL support in core academic areas, along with  lesson modifications and technology supports.  They are also programmed for an ENL resource period two times per  week (90 min) to assist in both formal academic language acquisition and writing.  Commanding students receive the  later resource room type of support.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A    2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?    At present, ENL/ELA integration is delivered using a team-teaching model.  The ENL teacher works with the ELA colleague to  deliver instruction and support students within class.  Students also follow up with a resource room period two times per  week.  Within 90 minute blocks, the ELA and ENL teacher lead instruction at a ratio of 50% each.  This includes a minimum of  15 minutes to activate prior knowledge with audiovisual materials and other resources; an equal period of time in which skills  are modeled by either teacher or both; an extended period of time (approximately 30 - 45 min) for students to practice in  groups, individually, etc., and as well as a subsequent block for reflection and/or an extension of skills through application.       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   ENL teachers in push-in classes provide additional support through: 1) explicit vocabulary instruction 2) additional visual aids 3)  graphic organizers 4) modified texts 5) additional time on task for repetition and reinforcement 6) as well as for modeling and  developing heterogeneous groups/collaborative learning activities.   In addition to alternating as the classroom lead during  different moments of the lesson, ENL teachers also follow-up with resource room instruction as a separate period 2 times per  week in which they engage in direct, targeted instruction around academic vocabulary and writing skills across a variety of  disciplines.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   Given our population and staff, we are able to more effectively evaluate students whose home language is Spanish, Haitian  Creole and Arabic.  This is done through a combination of formal and informal assessment.   We do not currently have the  capacity to assess Bengali home language students.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    SIFE - Combination of visuals and Discovery Book materials are used (2 pds/units ENL + 1 pd/unit. IEP/SETTS or 4 pds ICT).  The  flexibility of this programming is necessary to account for instances in which students' inability to "test out" of ENL is  attributed not to English language proficiency but rather the SWD status of the students.  We have often encountered  students who do not speak, write or read a language other than English although they come from homes in which a non- English language is predominant.    Newcomer - L1 support in addition to explicit vocabulary instruction, visual aides, and modified texts. ( 1 pd/unit ENL + 2  pds/units Content with ENL push in) Developing - Reduced L1 support with graphic organizers  and appropriate modified texts  (1 pd/unit ENL + 2 pds/units Content with ENL push in).  Long Term - Increased mainstreaming with additional time on task as   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      well as all previous supports (1 pd/unit ENL push in).  Former ELLs  - Mainstreaming and mixed grouping with additional time  on task (1 pd/unit ENL push in).        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?    ENL and/or IEP teachers in push-in, team teaching classes provide additional support through: 1) explicit vocabulary  instruction 2) additional visual aids 3) modeling of explicit language/academic skills 4) graphic organizers 5) modified texts 5)  additional time on task for repetition and reinforcement.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Our school offers only ICT and SETTS as a commitment to ensuring that SWD receive instruction in the least restrictive  environment.  ENL/SWD students typically receive either ENL as a freestanding class along with ICT push-in instruction for core  content areas or a combination of ENL push-in in certain subject areas, typically Humanities, and ICT push-in in others  (Math/Science).  Some students may receive a combination of ENL instruction and SETTS depending on the proficiency level for  English and the requirements of the IEP     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  ELLs in lowest third are assigned to additional time on task and Saturday classes in Math and Social Studies.  These services are  provided through combining English language instruction by content area teachers using ENL strategies and the delivery of  supports by ENL teachers (explicit vocabulary building, etc.)  In a small number of cases we are able to provide native language  instruction (Spanish Algebra, US and Global History)       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      3D modeling, band, chess in addition to photography.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   None.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All students are encouraged to play sports, join band or take art classes.  In addition, we have a number of student clubs (see  below).       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Spanish language text books for math, history and literature; dictionaries, glossaries, etc. for Bengali, Haitian Creole,  Arabic.  We also use translation software on specially equipped ipads and laptops.       13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   In humanities and math classes, there is Spanish language support for ENL students in the form of Native language content  instruction (Global and Algebra, Geometry).  We also have tutoring for Arabic and Haitian Creole.  We do not currently have  native language support for Bengali.        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    The school has hired two bilingual Guidance Counselors and a Bilingual SW.  Additionally, there are staff at the school that  speak prominent languages such as Arabic, Bengali, Haitian Creole and Spanish.  These staff members make bilingual  announcements to advertise clubs and activities.  These staff are also strategically programmed to serve as advisers (See  below) to allow all ENL student the opportunity to explore social and emotional issues in their native language if they so  choose.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Spanish language text books for math, history and literature; dictionaries, glossaries, etc. for Bengali, Haitian Creole,  Arabic.  We also use translation software on specially equipped ipads and laptops.  The campus is now moving to a model in  which resources and best practices are shared.       16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Our school has several student clubs and general enrichment/fun activities for students.  LACSU, the Latin American and  Caribbean Student Union, is a multilingual and cultural group that combines ENL and English students and engages in a number  of service projects and field trips throughout the year.  They are mentored by a teacher and bilingual social worker and  maintain their own website as well as specialize in activities open to the whole school.  SYFA, Student Youth Fellowship  Association, is a multicultural group comprised mostly of South Asian and Middle Eastern students.  They carry ot similar work  and activities as LACSU.       17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Traditional language electives include Spanish and French.  Additional elective open to all ENL students include Music, 3D  modeling, Photography, and Art.      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A           Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  ENL teachers will attend a series of PD workshops facilitated by our Affinity Support Organization (New Visions).  The topics for  the Fall of 2017 include: Content Area instruction for ENL - Speaking and Listening (September 20) and Content Area  instruction for ENL - Reading (October 26).  There are additional PD workshops, dates TBD on writing for the Common Core  English Regents offered by the Office of ENL NYCDOE.  The PD plan for the school also includes the integration of ENL teachers  into PD workshops offered to ELA teachers around writing and the development of argumentative essays.       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Bilingual School Social Worker provides counseling and all 9  th   grade students have advisory classes.  Additional advisory  classes are developed with bilingual/multilingual staff to ensure that all students can participate fully.  Finally, GCs make  efforts to strategically group students so that they receive peer support.

How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   The parent coordinator arranges 2 family nights per semester in which IEP and ENL families and staff conference.  These nights  are scheduled for October and December as well as March and May.  These meetings rely on translations provided by  students, staff and CBO representatives.  Individualized plans are shared with parents, who are invited to add input and  contribute to the identification of goals.  Parents are also explained where students are in the continuum of progress as well as  the supports they can provide at home to foster student achievement.  These meetings incorporate both staff with native  language proficiencies and the translation unit.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Parent Association meetings are bilingual (English/Spanish) with a core group of parents that assist with Bengali.  We use a  phone messaging system to announce meetings that has a multilingual function - English, Bengali, Spanish and Arabic.  We also  send out written notices in the above-listed languages as well as Haitian Creole.           Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Carlos Borrero, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   HS for Community Ldshp                                                                              School DBN: 28Q328  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
