This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.

The P.S. 140X community is situated in the Morrisania section of the South Bronx, one of the lowest socio-economic  areas of the Bronx. Despite our location, we were able to improve parental involvement through our partnership with  our Parent Association. We also partnered with Fordham University to create and maintain our Old School Museum,  which fosters a sense of pride in the community. Our 5th grade students have the leadership opportunity to escort  visitors while highlighting the history through our halls. Our joint venture with city and political organizations provide  our students with a sense of community and mentorship.       3.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36     conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 140X , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      P.S. 140X is providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement  level, e.g., literacy, math and use of technology:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;    ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;    ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;    ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      ● and providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community.      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:    ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;    ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;    ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;    ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

These students  are chosen based on their below-level reading scores based on the Teacher's College Reading  Running Record given by their classroom teachers. The program will run three days a week  (Wednesday, Thursday, Friday) starting in January and running through April. Students will  meet for two hours, three times per week, beginning at 3:00PM and ending at 5:00 PM. Funding  for direction instruction will come from Title III. If additional funds are needed, it will come  from the school's Title I money. In between the sessions, teachers will have an opportunity to  adjust those groups to meet the needs of the students in their group.      The total number to benefit from this program will be between 20-30 students. Ms. Green, Ms.  Opara, and Ms. Guerrero, the ENL Teachers with certifications in TESOL, will use data acquired  from NYSELAT / NYSITELL scores, ELA exams, ELL assessments, class assessments,  classroom teachers' observations, and conferencing notes, to form the basis for these groups and  regrouping. Each ENL teacher will have their own group. Ms. Guerrero, who speaks Spanish,  will work with the students who are still Spanish-dominant and limited-English.    The ESL Teachers will work on literacy and language development during the program.  All  lessons will be differentiated to ensure that student's individual needs are met.  Teachers will use  programs such as Learning A-Z, i-Ready, Wilson Fundations, and Benchmark Reading, at no  cost to Title III, for phonemic development and language acquisition. Teachers will use the  Wilson Fundations program to teach letters and sounds, at no cost to Title III. These materials  are not different from those used for daily instruction. If students are ready for Guided Reading,  Reading A-Z books and lessons will be used for instruction, at no cost to Title III.    Our Saturday program will meet for a total of ten sessions and will also begin in January. These  sessions will be held from 9:00AM-12:00PM. These sessions will be for 10-15 3rd-5th graders,  Transitioning-Expanding, in order to prepare them for the ELA state exam as well as the  NYSESLAT. Reinforcement of reading and comprehension will be the main focus. We will use  NYSESLAT practice books, at a cost to Title III funds. The ESL Teachers will also target Long- Term ELLs (approximately 5 students), as per the EDAT report, using direct instruction that will  focus on strengthening and reinforcing literacy skills, reading comprehension, increasing  fluency, and vocabulary building. Differentiation will be determined with data acquired on  individual modality needs as per the 2018 NYSESLAT results and classroom assessments.  ESL Teachers will meet with classroom teachers during grade meetings on a monthly basis to  review classroom teachers' observations, questions, and academic concerns.  These will be used  to discuss, plan, and develop students' learning goals.      Attendance, student work, and any assessments will be recorded by the ESL teachers and kept in  a binder/bin. Parents will be notified of the program via a letter that will be sent in their preferred  language.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46           Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.     rationale  teachers to receive training          schedule and duration      name of provider   topics to be covered   Begin description here:               Professional Development about ELL education is provided by Ms. Green, Ms. Opara, and Ms.  Guerrero, the ESL Teachers, as well as ENL staff from the Bronx Field Support Center.

To ensure that the professional development sessions meet the  needs of the teachers, the ESL Teachers are available to all teachers and is in constant contact  through common grade meetings.   On August 29,30,31 and September 1, our teachers will  receive extensive Professional Development on the Principles of UDL and the use of Thinking  Maps in order to assist with critical thinking.  During the month of October our Professional  Learning Team began a series of workshops in order to establish structured and organized  literacy stations appropriate for each grade level and supportive to our ELL population.  Topics  included, identifying types of stations, planning and aligning literacy station for each unit of  study, preparing and implementing activities for our literacy stations, utilizing management  techniques that enhance learning outcomes and identification of structure for the readers  workshops.  These will provide an organizational system for our guided reading groups.  For  the  month of November our Assistant Principals as well as other staff (turn keying) will  continue our Balanced Literacy Center workshops  and we will also facilitate workshops on  "Creating Measurable Outcomes".  These workshops will be held during Professional  Development Mondays each week for 70 minutes duration.  These will assist teachers in creating  measurable and usable assessments that facilitate teacher's knowledge on their students' learning  and needs.      Every other month, Kristy De la Cruz, Deputy Director for ELLs from the Bronx Borough Field  Support Center and Tomasz Grabski, ELL Service Coordinator for District 8, will host a PD on a  Monday for 70 minutes on supporting ELLs in the classroom, at no cost to the Title III  program.Topics will include scaffolding, academic language, reading and math strategies, and  NYSESLAT prep.

We  recognize the importance of the home school connection in aiding students’  language acquisition and learning experience.  Parents are an integral component of the ELL  program.  All parents at our school are informed and involved with our Parent Coordinators.  Parents are  provided translation services as necessary by Parent Coordinator in Spanish, the DOE  Translation Unit, and other bilingual school staff. Parents are provided with a monthly school  calendar and these are made available at the school's sign-in station and in the main  office.  These calendars provide information on school wide events, holidays and workshops  offered.  Bilingual fliers are used to remind parents of all upcoming events.  At P.S. 140,  Administration and staff maintain an open door policy and are in constant contact with parents to  ensure that the parents’ needs are met.    Tuesdays from 2:40-3:15, families of ELLs are invited to meet with Ms. Green, Ms. Opara, and  Ms. Guerrero to discuss their child’s progress and areas of concern. Translators via the Parent  Coordinator (in Spanish), the Translation Unit, and Ms. Guerrero are used in order to set up the  meetings and translate during the meetings. Other topics include how to improve reading, what is  guided reading, journaling - finding our writing voice, academic games that help increase  vocabulary and reading skills, Common Core - How does it impact our ELL population?,  Homework help and other related topics. Attendance is maintained in a binder.   In addition, starting in October, 2018, we will offer ESL classes for Parents who want to learn  English, regardless if their child is an ESL student. These classes will take place twice a month,  during our Super Tuesday Family Engagement time. We will send out flyers in English and  Spanish to advertise these sessions. Light refreshments will be a cost to Title III funds. Parents  will learn common English phrases/questions that will help them navigate the area/school  environment. The ESL teachers will use resources they already use for the ESL program, at no  cost to Title III funds.

Assessment outcomes are shared by ENL  and classroom teachers in order to modify and scaffold the learning activities for each student.  This assessment is used with  all ENL students. These assessments are administered at the beginning, middle, and end of year to show student growth. All  data is kept in a binder.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51         The Rigby ELL Reading Assessment Kit is administered by ENL teacher to all ELLs three times throughout the year.  This  assessment provides each student’s speaking, listening, reading and writing levels.  The Rigby ELL Reading Assessment Kit  assesses students’ current listening level (Stage 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5).  Another important aspect of this assessment is the ability to  evaluate students' speaking level by having student answer particular questions on the assigned levelled reader.  Students'  answers will equip us with a speaking stage performance score for student (Level1 through Level 5). In the reading portion of  this assessment, students read-aloud a levelled reading while ENL teacher is taking notes of miscued words, reading patterns  and notes these on reading records maintained in ENL classroom.  Students then answer questions based on literacy abilities  provided by this program.  This part of the assessment is individual work.  ENL teacher provides instructions on completion of  this task and if student needs additional guidance to complete the task, ENL teachers works one on one with students.  The  writing assessment of this program includes use of thinking maps in order to facilitate writing focus.  Student then uses the  thinking map in order to write on the topic they chose from the given list of possible topics.  Writing patterns that are assessed  with this program are: message and content, conventions, word choice and academic language and sentence structure.  The  reading comprehension assessment include: identifying details, identifying cause and effect, what is the author's purpose,  recognizing sequence, inference and other critical components of reading comprehension (inference, and finding the main  idea). The ELL students' reading progress is monitored by ENL teacher; results are shared with classroom teachers and are  available in the Data Center located in the ENL Classroom.  Areas of concern are discussed at length by classroom and ENL  teachers during common planning meetings and weekly SIT meetings. The Rigby ELL Reading Assessment is research based and  provides data on all four modalities: listening, speaking, reading and writing.   ENL teachers maintain a yearly profile of  students' reading progress.   If no movement is noticed, then student will be referred for additional services (AIS, RTI and/or  SETSS). ELL students that exhibit phonemic difficulty receive additional I-pad usage time where they are able to individually  practice the areas of difficulty (using Starfall or TEACH Me) with ENL or Classroom teacher supervision.       Teachers use conference notes to monitor ELL students' reading progress, concerns and other vital observations.  These notes  are also shared with parents during parent-teacher conferences 3 times a year, Tuesdays from 2:50 pm.-3:10 pm, Back to  School Night, and if necessary, an individual appointment is made with parents in order to discuss and recommend supportive  home activities that can enhance students' academic and language development.  Parents are assisted in completing the  application for community after school programs in order to reinforce language acquisition.        In each classroom, teachers will be using Measures of Student Learning New York City Performance Assessment for grades K- 5.  These assessments will be administered at the beginning and the end of our academic year to monitor growth and progress  in math, literacy and science.  Assessments will be made available in Spanish as needed.  The Measures of Students Learning  New York City Performance Assessments will be used by the MOSL Team (Measures of Student Learning), our grade inquiry  projects, content teams and RTI Team in order to adjust and provide the necessary academic interventions.       Our ENL teachers and classroom teachers meet during our Monday Professional Development sessions (2:50-4:00) and grade- level meetings in order to strategize and assist students' academic growth.       Classroom teachers, ENL teachers, School Nurse, Service Providers, and Guidance counselors also discuss health  matters/behavior matters that might be noted in classrooms: for example, health problems (vision and hearing), attendance  patterns and other factors that might hinder students' academic success, language development, and personal acculturation.          2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   ENL teachers and classroom teachers are able to share data and notes on the students during weekly grade-level meetings,  preps, and Monday Professional Development sessions (2:50-4:00).      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?     ENL teachers primarily focus on the NYSESLAT scores from the previous year to inform instruction, grouping, and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      differentiation. Gains/losses in all four modalities (listening, speaking, reading and writing) acquired from the NYSESLAT will be  used to provide literacy support during after school programs and Saturday Academy which start in late December. Academic  concerns for ELLs are presented at SIT (School Intervention Team) meetings by the ENL teachers, related service providers,  classroom teachers, School Base Support Team, and results from our AYP (how the ELLs compare to City wide scores).    ENL teachers also use the school's NYC Performance Task baseline/benchmark assessments from the previous year to analyze  the students' growth.            4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    The School Implementation Team (SIT) meets on a bi-weekly basis to discuss students who need referring for services. The ENL  Coordinator will use data such as NYSESLAT, ELA, and baseline/performance task scores in order to refer students who are not  making the necessary gains. At-risk services such as RTI, SETSS, or Speech will be considered for the student (s).     If the student (s) need more classroom interventions, the ENL Teachers and classroom teachers will meet during Tuesday PD  time (3:10-3:50) or during weekly grade-level meetings in order to discuss the needs of the student (s), co-plan integrated ENL  instruction, and align stand alone ENL instruction to classroom activity.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]      At P.S. 140, students’ progress is monitored and measured by use of City Periodic Assessments, teacher made assessments,  running records, and conferencing notes.       Our ENL teachers use the previous year's NYSESLAT modality scores to determine differentiated and group classroom activities  to enhance and provide support in students’ content and language growth.  Students acquired Rigby Reading Level/DRA level  is later used for tiered groups.        RTI is used to give at risk students the necessary support in literacy and math in small group instruction.  The Language  Proficiency Team uses baseline assessment results, attendance, prior academic achievements (state ELA and Math tests), ELL  academic needs, teacher recommendations, and the NYSESLAT results for referrals for RTI services.  RTI teachers use Teachers  College reading assessments and remedial text to guide small group instructions. Results of other classroom assessments are  shared with our RTI instructors in order to align instruction to the students' needs.      Classroom teachers use tiered grouping in the classrooms.  Students are provided with targeted instruction designed to match  their learning needs as demonstrated by performance on periodically administered assessments.  In our weekly grade-level  meetings, teachers discuss and design effective, individualized instructional programs that aid in language acquisition for the  ELLs.  Often classroom teachers use I-pads in order to differentiate the instruction that will increase our ELLs phonemic  awareness needs (among other basic language development).  Our goal is to enhance basic literacy skills by increasing their  reading and writing abilities in a smaller group setting that provide opportunities for growth in all modalities of language  acquisition.  Progress, concerns, and strategies are extensively discussed by the classroom teacher and ENL teachers during  inter-visitations, grade-level meetings, meetings during preps, and  during Monday afternoon Staff Development (2:40-4:00  pm) in order to provide high-quality opportunities to learn.              6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53       The ENL program is structured based on the results from the previous school year's NYSESLAT scores. ENL Teachers frequently  refer to the RLAT on ATS which indicates who the current (and commanding) ELLs are, their NYSESLAT level, and which classes  they are in. ENL Teachers also review the ELA scores in case students score a 3 on the ELA and an Expanding on the NYSESLAT,  which makes them a Commanding student. We use the new CR Part 154 guidelines to schedule the ELLs their minutes based  on their proficiency levels. The two ENL Teachers and the per diem ENL Teacher all instruct in the stand alone and integrated  model. For students who recieve stand alone minutes, they are grouped based on their reading level, which the ENL teachers  obtain either from the previous year's End of Year assessment or the current year's Beginning of Year assessment.    For incoming students from a non-doe school or from another country, the ENL teachers administer the Home Language  Identification Survey and the Student Interview survey to determine whether the student could be an ELL. If they are, they are  administered the NYSITELL and Spanish Lab where necessary. ENL Teachers also use those scores to inform groupings. In the  2016-2017 year, we administered the NYSITELL to 17 students (4 Kindergarten, 4 First grade, 1 Second grade, 4 Third grade, 2  Fourth Grade, 2 Fifth grade).    Students who are still at the Entering and Emerging levels (6 Kindergarten, 9 First graders, 14 Second graders, 9 Third graders,  4 Fourth graders, and 5 Fifth graders) receive heavy support in phonemic awareness, phonics, and basic reading skills.    Depending on the needs of the students and their DRA scores, previous years' assessments, etc students at the Transitioning  level (5 Second graders, 4 Third graders, 4 Fourth graders, and 5 Fifth graders)  either work on reading (fluency, decoding, etc),  reading skills, reading comprehensi0on, or more advanced material such as academic vocabulary and higher order thinking.       For SIFE students, they will be closely monitored by ENL and classroom teachers for extra intervention and support according  to students’ individual needs.  Referrals will be discussed at the SIT (School Implementation Team), SBST (School Base Support  Team) and the MOSL Team.  SIFE students are identified during the initial Home Language Interview surveys with the parents  and students to determine whether the student has had limited, interrupted schooling.      Students who do not make progress on the NYSESLAT from year to year and continue to remain at the Entering or Emerging  levels will be closely monitored and if necessary, will be referred to the SIT (School Implementation Team).              7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   In order to plan a stand alone and integrated program, ENL teachers must be privy to the latest Prep schedule produced by the  Assistant Principal, so that they can provide integrated instruction during ELA and do not provide stand alone minutes during  mandated preps such as gym and science.    Second, ENL teachers collaborate with the classroom teachers during preps and grade-level meetings to discuss the optimal  times during a teacher's schedule to provide integrated and stand alone minutes.    At the beginning of each year, the ENL teachers attend each grade-level meeting to disseminate information such as the RLAT,  any new changes to the ENL program, and information about the students in their classroom (anecdotes, scores, etc).    The ENL Coordinator works very closely with the Pupil Accounting Secretary and the main office secretaries in order to make  sure all new incoming students/parents are interviewed and that an RLAT is printed in order to see if any transfer students are  ELLs.            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.      We offer Freestanding ENL which includes integrated and stand alone ENL, provided by 2 ENL Teachers and 1 per  diem ENL teacher.     For the 2017-2018, the ENL Coordinator, Pupil Accounting Secretary, and Assistant Principal are working very closely  to ensure that the ELLs are clustered appropriately into as few classes as necessary so that the ELLs will receive all  their allotted integrated and/or stand alone minutes based on the 2016 NYSESLAT scores and CR Part 154. Students  are clustered into classes homogeneously and/or by what is designated on their IEP (such as 12:1:1, 12:1, or ICT). This  is done purposely in order to make programming and scheduling easier to meet compliance.    ENL and classroom teachers work closely together when making the ENL integrated and stand alone schedule in order  to cause the least disruption to the classroom schedule.     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.        NOT APPLICABLE        c.  DL program.  If applicable.         NOT APPLICABLE           2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?      For the 2017-2018, the ENL Coordinator, Pupil Accounting Secretary, and Assistant Principal are working very closely to ensure  that the ELLs are clustered appropriately into as few classes as necessary so that the ELLs will receive all their allotted  integrated and/or stand alone minutes based on the 2016 NYSESLAT scores and CR Part 154. Students are clustered into  classes homogeneously and/or by what is designated on their IEP (such as 12:1:1, 12:1, or ICT). This is done purposely in order  to make programming and scheduling easier to meet compliance.    Once this is complete, the ENL teachers look at the RLAT/NYSESLAT scores and ELA scores and record which students receive  stand-alone and/or integrated minutes. Then, they look at the school's prep schedule and the classroom teachers' schedules in  order to make the ENL schedules. Explicit ENL instructional minutes are delivered to all our ELL population as per CR Part 154- 2.    We integrate content instruction and language instruction into the ENL mandated minutes.    Copies of ELL students' grouping and schedules are available in the ENL classroom and a copy is shared with the secretaries   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      and administration. All ENL programs are evaluated by Administration for compliance.         3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   During integrated ENL, the ENL teacher and classroom teacher plan the lesson so that the ENL teacher can assist with the  language demands necessary for the content lesson. These teachers meet during weekly grade-level meetings, common preps,  and/or Monday PD time (2:40-4:00). Students are supplied further support and enrichment through accountable talk, peer to  peer academic assistance, and use of the Smart Board (providing visual support for better understanding).  In math,  manipulatives and models are used in order to assist students with the processing of higher order content knowledge.These  lessons are delivered in English, however ENL teacher will use students' home language whenever possible. For those students  who speak Spanish, Spanish support is provided by the per diem ENL teacher. She provides additional support in Spanish  through the use of Spanish content books, Spanish Internet sites, and cooperative grouping.    There are several instructional strategies implemented to provide access to academic content areas as well as English language  development for ELLs, for example:  Thinking Maps, guided lessons, cooperative learning groups, and online computer  programs (Starfall, TEACH ME, MyOn, Learning A-Z)      During stand alone ENL, Entering and Emerging students who have not yet mastered the alphabet use Wilson Fundations to  learn letters and sounds, basic sight words, and finally sentence writing. This is necessary in order to help them function in  their classroom when they need to read and write. Depending on the needs of the students, students who are past pre-primer  and primer levels work on their basic reading skills in order to improve their reading levels; if they are on-level with reading,  ENL teachers support and supplement core content by teaching the language (vocabulary, language competencies, etc)  necessary to understand the content. ENL Teachers work closely with the classroom teachers in order to parallel what is being  taught in the classroom.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?            In our current ENL Program, we evaluate our students in English and in their home language.  ELL students in 3/4/5 will  work with math books in their home language (Go-Math).  Home language versions of math assessments will be used  whenever possible. For students who cannot yet express themselves orally or in written form in English, they are given the  option of an oral exam in their home language, translated by an ENL teacher.               5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status       a. SIFE: Our ENL and classroom teachers provide our SIFE students with literacy activities that are meaningful, interactive, and  interesting. SIFE students are teamed up with a student that speaks their home language in order to motivate, guide, and  support classroom participation.  Our SIFE students are provided the opportunity for extended practice.  ENL teachers  follow the curriculum maps of each grade level in order to determine which reading and writing strategies are being  emphasized during the week so that they can build and expand on it with the SIFEs. Tier grouping, guided reading/writing  groups, and individual conferencing will assist students in these areas. SIFE students are targeted for programs such as   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      Saturday Academy and After School tutoring in order to address their needs. ENL teachers use Wilson Fundations, Learning A- Z, and electronic resources (Starfall, TEACH Me, MyOn) to provide kinetic phonemic clues and are a great resource for phonics  and language fluency acquisition. Letter-sound correspondence, letter recognition and formation, and decoding strategies are  taught mainly during stand alone ENL, but reinforced during integrated ENL lessons.   SIFE students are facilitated with  interesting reading materials at different reading levels available at ENL classroom. Student may borrow books from the ENL  room. Books in Spanish and Arabic are provided for those students who can read in Spanish and Arabic. For math, ENL  teachers use manipulatives, tables, charts, models, and real life situations to scaffold the lessons.    b. Newcomers: ENL teachers also use the Wilson Fundations program to introduce newcomers to the English alphabet and  words. Online programs such as MyOn, TEACH Me, Starfall, and Learning A-Z help facilitate the transition to the English  language. In the classroom, newcomers are paired with higher-proficiency students who speak their home language in order to  support them with the classroom activity. Newcomers who speak little English are encouraged to use their home language to  orally present or write. All Newcomers are also encouraged to draw what they have learned. They are encouraged to label and  use Thinking maps for expansion in content area and for vocabulary development and enrichment.  Graphic organizers will  provide them an opportunity to work with TR/EX ELL in their classroom for support and guidance. They are also facilitated with  I-pads during classroom literacy time for additional classroom language support. ENL and classroom teachers work in  conjunction so scaffolding of classroom activities may be reinforced in the ENL classroom learning. Newcomers also participate  in Saturday Academy and After School tutoring in order to develop their English.    C. Developing: Developing ELLs continue to work on their literacy skills: decoding, literal and inferential comprehension, basic  sentence and paragraph development, etc, in order to build on the skills they have acquired. During integrated ENL,  developing ELLs are paired with higher-level ELLs in order to facilitate their learning. Developing ELLs participate in Guided  Reading, Writing, and Math groups as a scaffold. Developing ELLs make use of Thinking Maps and iPad technology in order to  facilitate their learning.     D. Long Term: ENL teachers look extensively at assessments (DRA, benchmark, performance tasks, ELA scores if applicable) in  order to determine which areas the Long Term ELLs are still struggling with. Long Term ELLs practice reading skills, reading  comprehension, and intensive instruction in writing, grammar and other language development areas that prevent them from  becoming English proficient.  This group is extensively monitored for areas that might be hindering students' optimum literacy  development.  Areas of concern are discussed during grade-level meetings.  Strategies and support is planned and monitored  by ENL and classroom teachers.  Observations are shared with Administrators.         E. Former ELLs: As mandated by CR 154, all Former ELLs receive 90 minutes a week or integrated ENL. ENL and classroom  Teachers work closely to lesson plan for the times that the ENL teacher will be in the classroom. The ENL teachers continue to  provide language support for the Former ELLs by focusing on key vocabulary, competencies (discourse, pragmatic, grammar)  that the students will need in order to comprehend the content lesson. As a form of scaffolding, former ELLs are often paired  with lower proficiency students in order to challenge the higher-proficiency student and provide support for the lower- proficiency student.          All eligible ELL testing population (3rd, 4th and 5th graders) are given unlimited time to complete the tests.  They are tested in  a separate location in a small grade-appropriate group.  They are provided with bilingual dictionaries to be used during the  Math, Science and ELA State Test.  Students are given an English and Spanish test booklet (when applicable).  For the non- available language booklets, Translators were used during our Math and Science State Test for students whose home language  is Arabic and French.                  6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57         Teachers of ELL-SWDs currently use Wilson Funations, Ready Gen, Go Math, Learning A-Z, Reading Street, Write Brite,  Harcourt science, History Alive, and multi-levelled Social Studies thematic text books in order to provide access to academic  content areas and accelerate English Language Development. All materials used in the classroom are Common Core Aligned.  Vocabulary in content area is scaffold by the ENL teachers during integrated instruction and classroom teachers also  scaffold the academic material in the classroom.  Low-proficiency students are paired with high-proficiency students that share  the same home language to foster English language acquisition. ENL teachers provide classroom teachers with strategies and  scaffolds that they can use in the classroom (provided during Monday PD time, weekly grade-level meetings, and common  preps). All teachers differentiate their instruction by using Thinking Maps and online programs (MyOn, Starfall, TEACH Me,  Learning A-Z).                 7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  To ensure that ELL-SWDs receive their services as per their IEPs, ENL teachers, classroom teachers, and services providers  (SETSS, Speech, OT, PT, Counseling, Psychologist) conference bi-weekly during School Implementation Team (SIT) meetings.  IEP Team monitors all IEPs, and a log of ELL-SWDs is maintained by the IEP Team and ENL Coordinator to monitor delivery of  recommended related services through the use of SESIS reports, as well as communicate when IEPs are up for review/whether  an ELL will be receiving related services. We use SESIS to monitor IEP compliance and progress.    Our school modifies curriculum and instructions to meet the diverse needs of our ELL-SWD by creating language centers within  the classroom setting that allow our ELLs to utilize language base computer assisted instruction (CAI).  Additionally. ELL- SWDs are afforded push-in opportunities in general education classes (Math, Science and Social Studies) that afford flexible  programming.  Instruction is differentiated for our ELLs by providing instructional materials in their home language and  working with higher-proficiency students that speak their home language. Texts are modified/adapted based on the reading  levels of the students. Manipulatives are used in math as a scaffold. Books on tape are used for students with low reading  levels. The service providers work collaboratively with classroom teachers so that students receive all support services for  academic achievement.  Flexible programming is used to also maximize the time our ELL-SWDs spend with their peers.                   8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Our targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math and other core content areas are offered during our  After School  tutoring program and Saturday Academy taught by our TESOL certified teachers.  The Per Diem ENL teacher who speaks  Spanish works with the Spanish-dominant students, while the other two ENL teachers work with more English-dominant  students to continue developing their English skills. These Title I programs are available to our 3rd, 4th and 5th grade ELL  population, specifically targeting SIFEs and Long-Term ELLs.     Workbooks from Finish Line (New York ELLs Bilingual Common Core) and New York State (Attanasio & Associates Inc.) as well  as materials from Learning A-Z will be available in English and students' home language (when available).   These Title I  programs will begin in late December and finish in April. The After School Program runs from 3:00 p.m. - 5:00 p.m Wednesday- Friday and the Saturday Academy runs from 8:30 a.m. - 12:00 noon each Saturday.      The targeted interventions to be used for the ELA component will be ENL methodologies (scaffolding, thinking maps, and  sheltered instruction for comprehension of text and directional re-focusing in reading in order to enhance higher order   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      thinking in literacy skills). Rigorous accountable talk conversations will be used by ENL teachers in order to facilitate and  enhance higher order thinking.  ENL teachers will use this time to observe for language development in order to differentiate  individual work activities. ENL teachers provide students with visual (Smart-board use/iPads), models (maps and models) and  Shared Reading activities provided by the workbooks mentioned above.       In math, students will use manipulatives, cooperative learning, and real life experiences (in students home language for deeper  understanding) in order to scaffold vocabulary and content knowledge. ENL teachers will use the I-Pads available in ENL  classroom for individual learning as needed in their home language. The ELL students will work in cooperative group in order to  share common prior knowledge among the group members.         If deemed necessary by the SIT Team, at-risk SETSS is provided to ELLs in ELA and Math in English, and a Bilingual (Spanish)  Speech Teacher also provides at-risk services to those who are not meeting the standards.               9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?     All ENL Teachers will be trained to use the Bechmark writing program and will scaffold the material to teach it during  integrated and stand alone instruction. The ENL Teachers working with second grade students will become familiar with the  Reading Street Program, as the second grade teachers will be using that program all year long; the ENL teacher will scaffold the  material during integrated and stand alone instruction.     Wilson Fundations will continue to be used by all ENL Teachers to teach basic phonics and reading skills. Learning A-Z and its'  sub-groups (Reading A-Z, Writing A-Z, etc) will also be used to supplement classroom instruction.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   Not applicable.         11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.        Our daily after school program, South East Bronx Neighborhood Center (SEBNC), provides for social and academic support. It  facilitates educational development and acculturation for our ELL population.  They service students from kindergarten  through 5th grade. This program is staffed with bilingual personnel that allows for effective socialization and language  development  They are familiar with our ELL students and assist them with translation when necessary. Male ELLs can  participate in the SEBNC Basketball Team.      Our ELLs also participate in the Robotics After School Program.  Our bilingual school aide is available to this program in order to  provide equal access to technology terminology.        Our ELL students participate in After School tutoring (Wednesday-Friday 3-5PM) and Saturday Academy (8:30am-12pm)  programs at run from late December to April. Our TESOL certified ENL Teachers instruct these lessons. Winter and Spring  Academy (three days from 8:30am-12pm) are also available to ELLs.     4th grade ELLs can participate in the Ballroom Dancing Program.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  ENL Teachers scaffold the programs used in the classroom such as Reading Street, Ready-Gen, Go Math, and Write Brite.  During ENL  integrated and stand alone instruction. Wilson Fundations is used for those ELLs that need support with phonics  and basic reading.Workbooks from Finish Line (New York ELLs Bilingual Common Core) and New York State (Attanasio &  Associates Inc.) as well as materials from Learning A-Z  are also used to develop students reading comprehension skills and  writing skills.      In the ENL classrooms, students use iPads and interactive games on the Smart Board to help with math, phonemic/phonetic  awareness, language development, vocabulary, and writing development. Software includes Starfall, TEACH Me, Learning A-Z,  BrainPop, and MyOn.              13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   ENL: The Pupil Accounting Secretary and the ENL Coordinator work closely when assigning ENL students to future classrooms  for the upcoming year. For students who are still Spanish-dominant, they are strategically placed with a teacher who speaks  Spanish so that the teacher can support them with academic needs in Spanish. In addition, the Spanish-speaking Per Diem ENL  Teacher is the one who provides the integrated and stand alone minutes for these students, so that she can assist in their  transition from Spanish to English. All classroom teachers who service ELLs are provided with Spanish/English glossaries and  dictionaries for language support.    Fiction and non-fiction Spanish books are available in ENL Classroom for students to use in their classroom.    Smart-board technology and computers/iPads are used so that students may access home language information.    DL: Not applicable.    TBE: Not applicable      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Our Pupil Accounting Secretary works closely with the ENL Coordinator, Speech Teacher, OT/PT Teachers, Guidance  Counselors, and the IEP Team (SETSS teacher, IEP teacher, school Psychologist) in order to ensure that all ELLs and students  with IEPs receive their mandated services/supports. Parents of newly admitted or transfer students are asked whether the  student is an ELL or has an IEP. A report from ATS and SESIS is printed after 24 hours to double check whether the newly  registered student is an ELL or has an IEP. All related staff are informed immediately of this new student's required  services/supports. Students are placed in a grade level based on their age.     All support services cited above group ELLs by language proficiency and reading ability within their grade. Grade levels are only  mixed if the grades are 1 grade-level apart (e.g., Kindergarten and 1st/1st and 2nd/2nd and 3rd/3rd and 4th/4th and 5th).           15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Not applicable.      16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).      Before the beginning of our school year, families of newly enrolled ELLs are given a copy of our school informational pamphlet   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         (in their home language) and the Guide for Parents of Limited English Proficient Student in New York State (in their home  language).  Administrators will meet and greet families and a quick overlook of the school is offered by Parent Coordinator,  ENL teachers, School counselor and/or an Administrator.      Newly enrolled ELLs during the school year receive also receive the above pamphlets and walking tour, as well as an  opportunity for the parents to sit in the student's classroom to get to know the teacher and the environment. Family and  students are also brought to the ENL classroom, are given a tour, and are explained how the ENL program works, translated in  Spanish by our Per Diem ENL teacher, or in other languages by the DOE Translation Unit.     All newly enrolled ELLs are introduced to afterschool programs such as SEBNC and Robotics if they are interested in joining.         17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?       Not applicable          18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?      Not applicable.      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  During the beginning of the year, the ENL Teachers end out a survey to all staff who must receive ELL-specific PD on areas of  ELL education that they would like more help with. Areas include second language acquisition development, literacy  development, math support, writing support, phonics support, use of internet sites in the classroom, and family outreach  support. Based on the top preferences, the ENL Teachers provide professional development trainings throughout the year  during Monday PD time (2:40-4:00). Thomas Grabki and Kristy de la Cruz from the Bronx Field Support Center also provide 1-2  trainings a year to our staff during Monday PD on ELL education.      During Tuesday PD Time (3:10-3:50) and during weekly grade-level meetings, ENL Teachers may meet with classroom teachers  regarding strategies that will assist with ENL strategies. Our focuses are: SIOP, Sheltered Instruction and Scaffolding.      PD opportunities hosted by DELLSS, RBERN, The UFT, and the Bronx Field Support Center are posted in the main office for use  by all staff. These organizations provide training opportunities that enhance the skills and competencies of all educators who  impact the learning of ELL students. All ENL Teachers attend these trainings in order to meet their required PD percentage.                  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61            2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  All staff that are required to meet 15% of their total professional development hours as ELL-specific are provided ENL trainings  during Monday PD time (2:40-4:00) by the ENL staff, and/or the District 8 Bronx Field Support Center (Thomas Grabski and  Kristy de la Cruz). They are also informed of outside ELL trainings provided by the UFT, RBERN, or DELLSS that they can attend  on the weekends.  Records are kept by agendas and attendance.      ENL staff receive 50% of their total professional development hours as ELL-specific by attending trainings hosted by UFT,  RBERN, and DELLSS as well as any trainings hosted by the District 8 Bronx Field Support Center (Thomas Grabski and Kristy de  la Cruz) including monthly ELL PLC sessions. ENL staff can then turn key the trainings to the school staff during Monday PD time  or at grade-level meetings. Records are kept by agendas and attendance.            Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   All parents of ELLs are afforded on-going workshops via our Parent Coordinator and ENL staff. These workshops are conducted  on a monthly basis. The ENL teachers, along with our full time Parent Coordinator, (and Guidance Counselors and Children's  Health Fund employees when appropriate) conduct monthly workshops for the parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program,  language development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content  areas. Our Per Diem ENL teacher and Parent Coordinator provide the Spanish Translation, and the DOE Translation Unit is  contacted if other languages are necessary.     For those students who are graduating 5th grade and entering Middle School, our Spanish-speaking guidance counselor with  assistance from The Parent Association, Parent Coordinator (Spanish-speaking), and ENL Teachers are in constant outreach to  our 5th graders about middle school.  Flyers are posted in the auditorium, front entrance doors, and in other community  meeting areas and are available in all home languages of the ELLs. Information flyers are sent home in all home  languages. Moving up classes are brought to the middle school for walking tours and are introduced to the principal and  teachers of the middle school (I.S. 301).  Fifth graders are assisted with the application processes.  Guidance counselor works  closely with 5th grade teachers and guides our graduates with utmost urgency.                   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   As per CR Part 154, all parents of ELLs that are new to the DOE attend a Parent Orientation where they learn about the ENL  programs offered by the DOE (via the video in the parents' home language) and then specifically the one offered at our school.  Our Per Diem ENL teacher provides translation in Spanish. If other language translations are necessary, we use the DOE  Translation Unit. We discuss the goals of our ENL program (integrated and stand alone and how language is developed in  content areas), the transition that will happen to their student (s), how and how long it will approximately take for their  student to progress in English, testing that will occur and what the results mean, resources parents can use, websites and  phone numbers they can contact for help, and ways to access Health Care (specifically the Children's Health Care Fund at our  school).    Every Tuesday from 2:40-3:10, Parents are encouraged to meet with ENL teachers to discuss any concerns. Meetings include   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62         the discussion of language acquisition, understanding data, homework support resources, and literacy skill development in  Native Language and English.  ENL teachers and all classroom teachers work closely with on-site Counseling in Schools program  provided by Children's Health Fund.  The Counseling in School's program provides group, family, and individual sessions with  translation services by ENL teacher and/or DOE translation/interpretation unit as needed.      Parents of ELLs are invited to volunteer and assist in an assortment of events such as Hispanic Heritage activities, Parents'  Association activities, and other cultural celebrations held throughout the year.  Flyers of these events are sent home in  students' home languages.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   The Eagle School                                                                              School DBN: 08X140  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

Yes/No       (*Primary)             * The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs  on translation,   interpretation, compliance and budget.      School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Upon arrival to our building, the HLIS (Home Language Identification Survey) is given to the parents in the home  language. At P.S. 140 we have developed a Translation and Interpretation Team in order to communicate with  non-English speaking parents in their home language (Spanish, Arabic, French, and Italian, Mandingo and  Garifuna). This team is used for translation support to our parents. The team gets the information (surveys,  Emergency contacts cards) and translates it either through our in-house language proficient team members or via  and the DOE Translation and Interpretation Unit. The ENL teacher will assist parents with the completion of HLIS  (Spanish). We use information gather from Part 3 of the HLIS to assess parents' preferred language. If our parents  speak another language than English, Spanish or French) the Translation and Interpretation Unit is called for  assistance via over the phone translation.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66     2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     Written Preferred    Percent Written          Oral Preferred    Percent Oral          Language    Parents' preferred  language for both written  and oral communication at  this time are: Spanish,  French, Arabic, Italian,  Garifona, Fulani,  Mandingo, and Sioux.            3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.            Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services    1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be   distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.      Document Name    Month/Frequency Distributed to   How do you plan to translate?   Families    Include procedures to ensure timely  provision of translated documents      to parents.       The document that we typically  disseminate every year are: parent- teacher conference announcements,  after-school program information and  permission slips, announcements for  the New York testing dates, letters  from administration, newsletters.  These notices are distributed with  English on one side and the home  language on the other. These are  provided to our classroom teachers, to  distribute to students.
