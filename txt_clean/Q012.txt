This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The mission of the James B. Colgate Elementary School is to provide our students with the best education possible by  creating a learning environment that conveys high expectations for all students. Across classrooms, common core  aligned pedagogy engages all students in cognitively demanding tasks and provides all students with multiple  opportunities to extend and apply their knowledge. Teachers are empowered to plan for challenging and  differentiated activities that represent the importance of focused, purposeful and rigorous instruction.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9         2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Our two consecutive well-developed Quality Reviews (2013-14, 2015-16) and administrative observations indicate  that effective pedagogical practices create an environment in which all of our students are expected to learn at high  levels. All students are supported with appropriate scaffolds as well as extensions to the curriculum. The P.S. 12Q  community actively connects with families to promote a nurturing and inclusive atmosphere that prepares our diverse  student population to successfully compete in our interconnected, ever evolving world.      In 2016, P.S. 12Q was identified as a New York State Reward School. In 2017, P.S.12Q was identified as a School in  Good Standing. Although we did not achieve New York State Reward School status in 2017, P.S. 12Q continues to  consistently outperform our district, city, and state in both ELA and in Math as evidenced by the following statistics:      ELA Proficiency Percent P.S. 12Q District 24 NYC NYS  2013-14  2014-15  2015-16  2016-17  2017-18  5-Year Average   28  28  30  31  38  38  40  41  47  45  37  37   31  33  40  41  47  38   45  44  53  51  58  50      ELA 4-Year Average Comments:     PS 12Q is plus 12 points stronger than our district    PS 12 Q is plus 13 points stronger than the city and the state      Math Proficiency Percent P.S. 12Q District 24 NYC NYS  2013-14  2014-15  2015-16  2016-17  2017-18  5-Year Average   34  34  35  38  36  39  38  39  43  45  37  39   40  40  40  40  44  41   62  62  61  56  68  60      Mathematics 5-Year Average Comments:     PS 12Q is plus 19 points stronger than the district    PS 12 Q is plus 23 points stronger than the city   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10     PS 12 Q is plus 21points stronger than the state         Overall Comments about the State Tests:      Since the constructs of the 2018 state tests changed (for example from 3 days to 2 days), new baselines were  established     The 2017 and 2018 tests are not truly comparable since the constructs of the tests have changed    The 2018 baselines will be compared to the 2019 and 2020 state tests    The Common Core Standards are shifting to the Next Generation Learning Standards     In 2021, new baselines will be established compared to the Next Generation Learning Standards            For 3 consecutive school years, 2016-17 , 2017-18 and 2018-2019 , P.S. 12Q has been selected as a New York City  Promising Practice Showcase School. This distinct honor has been bestowed on thirty-seven schools citywide in 2016- 17 , forty-seven schools in 2017-18 and forty-seven schools in 2018-19. We are proud to be among this special group  of schools. Over the course of the 2018-19 school year, with the support of the Office of Leadership, we will host  three visits. Educators from our city will learn about our promising practices in relationship to our literacy curriculum.  Showcase visitors will observe that there is no perfect literacy program and will observe how P.S.12Q teachers have  adapted the Ready Gen curriculum to promote student learning through literacy centers. Educators from our city will  notice how the use of formative assessments allows our teachers to group students and to provide targeted  instruction.    In 2016, P.S.12Q was awarded as a N.Y.C. Respect for All School. At P.S. 12Q, we recognize the significance of our  Respect for All Program and that we must offer our school community multiple opportunities to reinforce the concept  of shared responsibility. Although, eighty-five percent of our students speak another language other than English and  more than 30 different languages, we make every effort to actively engage all members of our school community. As  future citizens of our world, the emotional and social readiness of our students is of utmost importance.   As a high achieving elementary school, we believe that our successes should be maximized and that we must regularly  reflect upon our missed opportunities. At P.S.12Q, success is evidenced when students are intellectually engaged  through careful planning and teacher skill. Our internal monitoring systems dictate that in order to prepare our  students for career and college readiness we must build their independence and stamina. During the 2018-19 school  year, we will look towards amplifying our strengths in mathematics and will continue to modify and perfect our  literacy curriculum.      Key Focuses for the 2018-19 School Year:     Garnering the use of formative and summative assessments to provide targeted instruction through small   group instruction, parallel, and co-teaching models     The purposeful readjustment of our reading program through a continued emphasis on Guided and   Independent Reading     The collaborative redesign of the Ready Gen and GO MATH curricula as instructional guides and not as   prescriptions for learning   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11              Curriculum adaptation with multiple entry points so that all English Language Learners and Students with   Disabilities have access to the same rigorous instruction as their general education peers     Continued emphasis on building student vocabulary through questioning, student to student discussion as   well as in Opinion Writing through the 2017-18 implementation of our new Social Studies Program, Passport  as well as through the 2018-19 implementation of our new Science Program, Amplify  Increased mathematics activities that focus on improving conceptual understanding versus procedural  knowledge         The expansion of professional development opportunities for all teachers and teacher teams through      increased distributive leadership as well as productive discourse  Increasing opportunities for family empowerment to actively participate in the education of their children  through Inquiry Teacher Team work, Cook Shop for Parents, Monthly Book of the Month Workshops, as well  as our ongoing and successful Tuesday Parent Engagement Program    3.

English Language Learner Program Overview:     Based upon an analysis of 2018 ELA and Math Cut Scores, we recognize the need to target our Long Term ELLs   during the 2018- 19 school year. Long Term, stalled ELLs will be provided with specific/differentiated ELA  Reading and Writing strategies. Reading strategies will include finding the main idea, supporting details, fact  versus opinion, cause and effect, and using context clues to build comprehension. Writing strategies will  include pre-writing activities, modeling, shared writing, and vocabulary word walls.     ELLS will continue to be offered supplemental instruction through AIS, our Afternoon Title III Program, our   Spring Test Prep Academy, and through our Wilson Reading Program .     An analysis of the 2018 New York State English as a Second Language Achievement Test (NYSESLAT) indicated   the following Implications for Instruction for the 2017-18 school year:     K: Increase Writing on Demand opportunities without sentence starters to build student independence.  Reduce word wall scaffolds as the year progresses. Develop sight word vocabulary in struggling learners.  Provide specific feedback to students to add more details to their illustrations. Build listening skills through  directional activities both written and orally.     1st and 2nd Grades: Increase student comprehension of pronouns in relationship to answering questions.   Increase student comprehension by word association such as "Who is the author talking about when she uses  the word he?" Increase reading and listening comprehension on how suffixes change the meaning of words.  Develop sequential understanding through pictures and events. Continue to focus on the main idea of a  passage.     3rd and 4th: Build reading and listening skills by instructing students how to answer multi-part questions.   Develop complex writing skills by instructing students to use strategies such as RAD (Restate-Answer-Details)  and by strengthening organizational writing skills through the use of transition words. Create matching  activities for story sequence practice. Provide opportunities for ELLs to draw and label detailed pictures. Use  rubrics to develop writing and drawing skills.     5th: Develop listening skills through the use of technology as an aid to build student listening skills and “other   than teacher” readings. Focus on how suffixes change the meaning of words. Develop questions that use  pronouns. Build student reading comprehension by instructing students on how to find the main idea. Focus  student attention to using FUN to find text evidence to support the main idea of a passage. Use chunking as a  strategy to annotate key ideas in the margins of texts. Strengthen student writing skills through the use of  expansion strategies through the use of transitional words.   Students With Disabilities Program Overview     Prior to referring a student for special education services, we integrate progress monitoring to support our   struggling students. Student achievement is closely monitored to assess both student learning rates and  student performance before decisions are made to increase the levels of intervention. Our (Response to  Intervention Team) RTI Team, works with classroom teachers to integrate progress monitoring before  students receive supplemental instruction. Students that have not made adequate progress at the Tier I Level  (from 6 to 8 weeks) are provided with intensive instruction through our Academic Intervention Teachers.     During the 2018-19 school year, our SWDs will continue to be provided with scaffolds that give them access to   the same rigorous Learning Standards as their general education peers.     Our Student with Disabilities Program will include the following strategies:   o  Consideration and Development of Fundamental Vocabulary   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13            o  Deconstruction and Reconstruction Activities  o  Modeling and Charting of Teaching Objectives  o  Contextualization of New Concepts  o  Use of graphic organizers as well as Thinking Maps  o  Building of Background and Prior knowledge  o  Use of Visuals and Primary Source Documents  o  Assignments that are Relevant, Meaningful, and Engaging  Instruction according to Student choice and Learning style  o      SWDs will continue to participate in supplemental instruction such as our Spring Test Prep Academy, our  Afternoon ELA/ Math Programs, and through our Wilson Reading Program.    4.

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     For the 2018-19 school year we will focus on grade-wide instructional emphases in order to build upon our continued  success in mathematics. Although the curriculum differs for each grade, students must master grade specific  standards in order to succeed from year to year. Across grades, varying cluster emphases require additional resources  and deeper focus. We must evaluate our instructional decisions, collaborate during teacher teams to establish  realistic time frames for key cluster emphases. Teachers must more consistently categorize and become more familiar  between the major clusters and supporting clusters. During the 2018-19 school year, we will increase classroom  activities that focus our students to improving conceptual understanding versus procedural knowledge centering on  the major content emphases. As teachers prepare to provide increased opportunities for achievement in  mathematics, they will continue to work on building student stamina. Teachers will also establish strong mathematics  routines to develop highly engaged learners through frequent formative assessments.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   By June 2019, 80% of all students will perform at or above grade level (middle and high range) as measured by the Go  Math! End of the Year Assessment.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          28     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and  strategies your school will implement to achieve the  identified goal for this Framework for Great Schools  element, including:   Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  The scope of a student’s vocabulary is a measure of educational success. Studies show that students who have a  vocabulary deficit fall behind academically. Based upon the analysis of 5 different writing traits (Focus, Organization,  Development, Vocabulary, and Conventions), we have observed that vocabulary usage and development in Opinion  Writing Performance Based Assessments (PBAs), across grades continues to represent an important academic focus.  An analysis of June 2018 PBA results indicates that the average score in Language and Vocabulary for all grades was  3.1 out of 4.0 and that the average score for Development was also 3.1 out of 4.0. These results focus our attention to  the importance of strengthening our students’ writing skills by developing their vocabulary. In order to communicate  ideas, develop thoughts, and emotions successfully, our students require increased opportunities to build their use of  Tier 2 and transition word vocabulary. Strategies to build vocabulary will include questioning and discussion  techniques as well as independent reading, guided reading, pre-writing thinking maps, and vocabulary center  activities. The building of Tier 2 and transition word vocabulary will allow students to support their opinions and to  develop concepts in greater detail.            Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  By June 2019, there will be a .5 increase in the average score of the vocabulary component in writing from September  to June as evidence by the Opinion Performance Based Assessments.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          31     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional  development, and/or systems and structures needed  to impact change.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   There is no perfect literacy program. What matters most is teacher skill, adaptation of our literacy curricula, and  attention to student learning. An analysis of June 2018 Running Records indicates that 67% of students are reading on  or above grade level. Since 33% of our students are reading below grade level, we must continue to modify our  literacy program through the further implementation of small group instruction. The use of formative assessments  allows teachers to quickly group students, to provide targeted instruction, and to accelerate learning. Formative  assessments authentically guide instruction and are far more important than summative assessments. Through small  group instruction, students will receive meaningful feedback about their ideas and responses. During guided reading,  students are empowered to take more ownership over their learning and are more willing to share their opinions.  Throughout the school year, students will receive effective feedback so that they could articulate their next steps for  success. Additionally, small group work develops student autonomy.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers.

The home-school partnership is critical to our ongoing success as a school. Research shows that family empowerment  in schools improves student achievement. Students with involved families earn higher grades and develop stronger  social skills. Although family attendance has been exceptionally strong during all school events (Tuesday Parent  Engagement, Parent Teacher Conferences, Parent Workshops, Family-Teacher Events), we must continue to find ways  to further empower parents. According to the 2017 NYC Survey (Q4c), 91% of parents state that they have  communicated with their child’s teacher about their child’s performance. This result represents a missed opportunity  since our teachers usually initiate the interaction. Parents tend to wait for their child’s teacher to make contact.

Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49      Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Surveys are distributed throughout the year to obtain feedback and need assessments from teachers. Collected  feedback is addressed in the decision making process when planning for professional development opportunities and  for determining best practices for assessment measures.    The PD Committee meets monthly to discuss and plan professional development opportunities based on teacher  needs.    The Consultation Committee meets monthly with the administration to discuss areas of concern and next steps for  school -wide improvement.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.

Our  school community conducts an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of our Parent Involvement Policy.  The findings of the evaluation through school surveys and feedback forms are used to design workshops to  successfully meet the needs of parents, and enhance the school’s Title I program.       Parental Involvement and School Quality   In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association, as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on the  proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input. To increase and  improve parent involvement and school quality, our school will:   · Actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title I  Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   · Engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated directly  to schools to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   · Ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in our Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   · Support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team and the  Parent Association.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  We believe that non-ELLs as well as current ELLs should experience identical assessments since we expect all of our students to  meet the  Learning Standards. However, we also believe that ELLs should have multiple opportunities to demonstrate  their  content area knowledge. At times, we administer assessments that may include visuals and/or oral responses. At times,  these type of teacher created assessments are more appropriate for ELLs than standardized testing formats. Consequently, our  teacher teams collaborate to tailor assessments to include a variety of different assessments suitable for ELLs.    The following assessments are administered to all of our students including our ELLs:  -Running Records 4 times per year  -End of Unit Performance Based Writing Assessments: 6 times per year   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65      -End of Unit GO MATH Chapter Assessments 9-11 times per year  -NYS Performance Tasks in ELA and Math  -Exits Slips and Teacher Created Tests across all grades  -Teacher created checklists     Our assessment data has supported the need to differentiate instruction according to reading level.  Although our running  records indicate that the majority of ours ELLs are approaching grade level standards, our ELLs still experience difficulty in  responding to higher order thinking questions. Our ELLs need strategies to build fluency and comprehension in reading, and  vocabulary to improve upon their writing skills. Our data also tells us that our 4-6 year ELLs need earlier intervention reading  strategies to unpack and to respond to complex texts as well as to decipher multi-step math problems. Additionally, newcomer  ELLs in grades 3-5 experience difficulty with number sense and we recognize that there is a need for re-teach strategies and  differentiated instruction.               2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The Pearson ReadyGen Program along with guided reading will continue to offer our students multiple opportunities and  strategies to improve upon their reading comprehension. Key components to our instructional plan will include: Read Alouds,  Shared Reading and Writing Strategies, Explicit and Context Embedded Vocabulary Development, Guided Reading, and  Reading Independently in Just Right Books. Our instructional plan includes: Building comprehension through scaffolding  strategies and sheltered instruction, increasing academic vocabulary through a context rich curriculum, and writing strategies  that focus on conventions as well as the writing process  (Pre-writing, Drafting and Revising, Editing).         3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  P.S.12 regularly evaluates and reflects upon the success of our ELL programs by measuring individual progress in English  Language Proficiency including reading levels, writing skills, use of academic vocabulary and performance on city and state  assessments. P.S. 12Q fully recognizes the importance of planned intervention strategies that challenge and motivate our ELLs  to think critically and creatively. P.S. 12Q fully understands the need to evaluate our ELL programs in order to prepare our ELLs  for college and career readiness. Our ELLs partake in all P.S. 12  assessments.    The following summative assessments are administered to our ELLs:  -NYC ELA Performance Tasks in Grades K-2  -NYC Math Performance Tasks in Grades 1-5       We evaluate the success of our programs as evidenced by the following student achievement data:     For the 2015-2016 school year, 180 students achieved English proficiency on the NYSESLAT which represents  30%  percent of  students taking the NYSESLAT.           4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    PS 12Q has many structures in place to address interventions based upon the data:  -Early Morning and After School ELL Program  -During the school day small group instruction  -During the school day parallel teacher model  -During the school day tiered literacy centers     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]      P.S. 12 makes all decisions about students based upon the analysis of data. Struggling students are identified for Academic  Intervention Services based upon years of ENL services, reading levels, end of unit assessments, Writing Performance Based  Assessments, as well as scale score grades on state tests.      Through collaboration with our RTI Team and our special education assistant principal, all teachers have been provided and  will continue to be provided with professional development workshops that focus on the importance of supporting struggling  students with high-quality, scientifically based, tiered classroom instruction.  In addition, research-based materials are  purchased to service Tier ll and Tier lll students (SPIRE, Wilson and Rewards Programs). The RTI Team meets twice per month  to review student progress. During our RTI meetings, we discuss and analyze student work products as well as  summative assessment results. Our AIS teacher uses the Rewards Program to develop fluency skills with our upper grade ELLs.     Additionally, the  RTI Team works with classroom teachers to integrate progress monitoring before students receive  supplemental instruction. Students that have not made adequate progress at the Tier I Classroom Level (from 6 to 8 weeks)  are provided with intensive instruction through the Academic Intervention Teachers.       The P.S.12 Q administration strongly believes that targeted and thoughtful instruction is at the core of ELL success.         6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].     2016 NYSITELL Grade K:  41 students scored at the Expanding Level   23 students scored at the Transitioning Level  15 students scored at the Emerging  Level   30 students scored at the Entering Level     2016 NYSESLAT Grade 1  41 students scored at the Commanding Level  62 students scored at the Expanding Level  14 students scored at the Transitioning Level   8 students scored at the Emerging  Level   12 students scored at the Entering Level       2016 NYSESLAT Grade 2  65 students scored at the Commanding Level  50 students scored at the Expanding Level   19 students scored at the Transitioning Level   2 students scored at the Emerging  Level    4 students scored at the Entering Level       *Our second graders must be provided with intensive ENL instruction that focuses on reading comprehension and the  development of academic vocabulary in order to prepare them for the rigor of grade 3.     2016 NYSESLAT Grade 3:  31 students scored at the Commanding Level   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67         23 students scored at the Expanding Level   12 students scored at the Transitioning Level   3 students scored at the Emerging  Level   10 students scored at the Entering Level          *There is a need to focus on third grade intermediate/advanced students and provide them with intensive ENL instruction in  all four modalities.

What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Every September, all teachers receive P.S. 12 created rosters highlighting two years of NYSESLAT student data. All teachers  utilize this data to formulate instructional groups.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.     We use two organizational models: Push-In (Co-Teaching/ Pull aside/Parallel Teaching) and Self-Contained. Our self  contained ENL classes are taught by licensed common branch and/or special education teachers with ENL   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68         certification. Our students are grouped heterogeneously by grade and by mixed proficiency levels and are  instructed through the stand alone model and integrated model as described in the CR Part 154 Requirements for  English as a New Language, Grades K-8. Newly proficient former ELLS are  placed in self-contained ENL classrooms to  provide them with further support.  Second year proficient students are placed in ENL classes as well. During small  group instruction our students may be grouped homogeneously or by mixed proficiency level depending on student  interest as well as student strengths.  In our English as a New Language (ENL) self-contained classrooms, the stand-alone model students are grouped  according to their ENL level. ENL instruction is 1 unit of study in ENL/ELA integrated (180 min each unit). The Emerging  students instructional time begins with 2 units of study per week (360 minutes).  Stand Alone ENL instruction which  includes .5 unit of study in ENL (90 min), Integrated ENL consists of 1 unit of study in ENL/ELA (90 min) and Flexibility  .5 unit of study can be Stand-Alone ENL or Integrated ENL/Content Area (90 min). A Transitioning student includes 1  unit of study per week (180 minutes) .5 unit of study in ENL/ELA (90 minutes) .5 unit of study Stand-Alone ENL or  Integrated ENL/Content Area (90 min). An Expanding student consists of 1 unit of study per week (180 min) in  ENL/ELA or other Content Areas (Science or Social Studies). Commanding (former ELL) will receive .5 unit of study per  week of integrated ENL in ELA or Content Area. Currently, ReadyGen is our ELA program, GoMath is our Math  program and both are used for integrated ENL instructional time.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Our TBE classes are taught by licensed bilingually certified teachers. At the beginning/entering level TBE students  receive 75% of instruction in Spanish and 25% in English. As a student's English proficiency increases (according to  running record levels), more of the instructional day is spent learning in English. Additionally, at the  entering/emerging levels, two content area subjects are  taught in the home language. Integrated into our bilingual  classes is a home language arts component crafted to develop skills in the four modalities of language acquisition.    c.  DL program.  If applicable.       Not Applicable.      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?    P.S. 12Q strictly adheres to ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes as specified by Part 154. The content areas taught during  the required minutes for Advanced/ Expanding and Proficient/ Commanding students include Social Studies, Math and  Science.     Our school ensures the mandated number of instructional minutes for each program model as follows:  In both our  Transitional Bilingual programs and English as a New Language programs  teacher instruction for ENL and Bilingual students  begins with 2 units of study per week (360 min)for an Entering student. This includes 1 unit of study in ENL Stand-Alone ENL  instruction and 1 unit of study in ENL/ELA integrated (180 min each unit). For an Emerging student instructional time begins  with 2 units of study per week (360 minutes).  Stand Alone ENL instruction which includes .5 unit of study in ENL (90 min),  Integrated ENL consists of 1 unit of study in ENL/ELA (90 min) and Flexibility .5 unit of study can be Stand-Alone ENL or  Integrated ENL/Content Area (90 min). A Transitioning student which includes 1 unit of study per week (180 minutes) .5 unit of  study in ENL/ELA (90 minutes) .5 unit of study Stand-Alone ENL or Integrated ENL/Content Area (90 min). An Expanding  student consists of 1 unit of study per week (180 min) in ENL/ELA or other Content Areas (Science or Social Studies).  Commanding (former ENLs) will receive .5 unit of study per week of integrated ENL in ELA or Content Area.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Core content area instruction to meet the demands of the CCLS/Next Generation Standards in the Free Standing ESL Program,  through the Push-In and Self Contained Model, is delivered in English. We make content comprehensible by using current  research based ENL and ELA strategies and methodologies. Content area instruction, ELA, Math, Science, Social Studies in our  TBE Program is delivered in Spanish and in English according to student proficiency levels daily.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69         * Consideration and development of fundamental vocabulary   * Deconstruction and Reconstruction Activities  * Modeling and charting of teaching objectives  * New ideas and concepts are contextualized  * Use of graphic organizers as well as Thinking Maps  * Building of background and prior knowledge   * Use of visuals, primary source documents and realia  * Offering our students content area instruction by exposing them to many different sources such as leveled libraries   * Smart Board Technology in every classroom  * Assignments that are relevant, meaningful, and engaging  * Differentiating instruction according to student choice, learning style, and proficiency level   *  Native Language Libraries and Glossaries in all content areas:Social studies, Math and Science  *  Native language texts for our TBE Programs in all content areas: Social studies, Math and Science        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      *To formally assess the native language skills of our kindergarten students in our TBE Program, we use a P.S. 12Q Initial  Assessment.   * For bilingual students in grade 1, P.S.12Q uses our native language libraries via teacher created assessments.   * In addition, P.S.12Q has purchased the Dibbles Program  to be used to assess the native language skills of our TBE students.     * Newcomers in Grades 1-5, are informally assessed through our bilingual staff members.   * Students are asked to read aloud and to respond to oral questions via grade appropriate native language texts.   * In addition, Newcomers in Grades 1-5, are administered an informal grade appropriate basic math computation assessment.     * Parents of newly enrolled ELLs in Grades 1-5 are always encouraged and requested to provide evidence of prior schooling.        5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Our ELLs are engaged in a challenging curriculum that builds academic English proficiency and higher thinking skills. We  differentiate instruction for our ELL subgroups in the following ways:      a. Identified SIFE students are provided with AIS in small groups in conjunction with differentiated instruction within the  classroom. SIFE students are offered additional services through our AM and PM Title III Program. Very few, if any of our  students are identified as SIFE according to the DOE definition.  In the event that a student's education is interrupted, we  provide additional family support during frequent parent engagement activities, including Native Language support.   The pupil  accounting secretary maintains records of these students and partners with our Attendance Teacher to follow DOE protocols.  The administration of P.S.12Q is committed to communicating to parents the importance of not interrupting the education of  children during the school year .         b.Instruction is differentiated to target our students in the U.S. less than three years. Newcomers participate in individual  conferencing sessions and small group strategy lessons throughout the school day. Emphasis is placed on providing grade 3-5  students with effective and specific complex text strategies. Newcomers in grades 3-5 participate in small group strategy   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70      lessons where we focus on the acquisition of Basic Interpersonal Skills (BICS) through the building of vocabulary and fluency.  Examples of BICS include : asking and answering everyday questions, describing feelings, sharing an event, and making a  request. During the school day, instruction is differentiated for our newcomers. Our key focus during the school day for all of  our ELLs is the acquisition of Cognitive Academic Language (CALPS) through grade appropriate content. Examples of CALPS  include: comparing and contrasting, describing cause and effect, explaining, defining, justifying, sequencing, and predicting.     c. ELLs receiving services from 4 to 6 years are targeted with differentiated reading and writing strategies. They are offered  additional support in Wilson Reading, Guided Reading Groups, our AM and our After School Title III Program. ELLs that  participate in our Title lll After School Program are grouped homogeneously according to ELA Scale Scores and/or Fontas and  Pinnel Running Records.. ELLs in Grades 3-5 attended our 2014 and 2015 Morning Test Preparation Program. ELLs receiving  services from 4-6 years are placed in Stalled ELL Inquiry Groups that focus on the acquisition of  reading and writing skills.     d. Long Term ELLs are provided with specific/differentiated ELA reading and writing strategies. Reading strategies include  finding the main idea, supporting details, fact versus opinion, cause and effect, and using context clues to build  comprehension. Writing strategies include pre-writing activities, modeling, shared writing, and word walls. Long Term ELLS  may be offered AIS, Wilson Reading,  an AM and a PM Title III Program.      e. Former ELLs are placed in self-contained classrooms in order to support their development. Self-contained ENL classrooms  are serviced by ENL Push-In Teachers so that all current and former ELLs receive the benefit of two teachers during literacy  and/or content area instruction. Former ELLs participate in our Test Prep Academy and our Title lll After School Program.  Our  former ELLs become our top students. We cite the following reasons for their success: We teach language and content  together. We integrate instruction thematically. We connect learning to our students' background knowledge. Through the use  of multicultural materials, we validate and respect the importance of the native language in the acquisition of English.        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   ELLs that have been identified with special needs are provided with grade appropriate access to academic content as well as  access to grade appropriate English language development.  During the school day, ELL-SWDs are given access to the same  curricula and materials as do their non-ELL counterparts.  Before and After School, ELL-SWDs participate in our Early Morning  Test Prep Academy and Title lll After School Literacy/Mathematics Programs.  ELL-SWDs are serviced according to their IEPs  using a sheltered instructional approach; Language for these students is modified, pacing is regulated, and vocabulary is  controlled allowing for increased comprehension.         ELL Students with Disabilities are provided with mandated ENL or bilingual instruction in accordance with their IEPs.  We apply  student specific ENL methodologies and strategies through a Push-In and/or Team Teaching Model.                    LEP SWDs in grades K-2 are taught strategies that focus on the acquisition of all four language modalities. Since the majority of  LEP SWDs in grades 3-5, are  proficient in BICS, ENL teachers scaffold literacy development, with an emphasis on CALP,  to help  our LEP SWDs in reading and writing. ENL teachers target their students' zones' of proximal development by providing  authentic assignments that are slightly more difficult to achieve independently. In turn, ENL teachers offer strategies to their  LEP SWDs to become lifelong learners by accelerating academic English proficiency. All ELLs are taught current strategies to  decipher and to respond to complex texts in order to meet the Common Core Learning Standards.        We support our our LEP SWDs with ENL materials that are of high interest. Smart Board/Promethien Board Technology in all  classrooms with SWDs and Lap Top computers for our 12:1 and ICT classes help to create and foster an interactive learning  environment. Guided Reading libraries as well as intervention kits help to support the literacy needs of our SWDs. ENL teachers  amplify the curriculum set forth by the city of New York to meet the needs of our LEP SWDs.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71         7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?   Our school uses curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to meet the diverse needs of our ELL- SWDs in the following  ways:     * All LEP SWDs are provided with their mandated periods of ENL instruction via licensed ENL teachers within the least  restrictive environment as is possible. We make every effort to provide our ELL-SWDs with ENL instruction through a Push-In  Model. As a rule, students are not pulled out for ENL services.     * ENL teachers support our ELL-SWDs by using grade appropriate materials to teach "word attack" skills. During the school day,  we recognize the need to teach our LEP SWDs  decoding skills that break down complex multi-syllable words. P.S.12Q uses the  Wilson, Rewards, and Fundations Programs via our classroom teachers to support the instruction of letter sound relationships.  * Our ELL- SWDs are challenged to develop strategies for acquiring new vocabulary. We use high interest reading  materials from our non-fiction classroom libraries, Guided Reading Libraries, Focus Books and The Pearson ReadyGen Literacy  Program to build upon encoding skills. Our ELL- SWD materials contain a large number of words that our students can  understand or derive through the use of context clues which builds self confidence and good reading skills . Understanding  words and their meanings is especially important when reading in the content area. ENL teachers push in during our literacy  block as well as during content area instruction in order to focus upon the development of academic language.  *Depending on the individual strengths of our ELL- SWDs, our 12:1 students may be mainstreamed during content area  instruction.  * Classroom teachers and ENL teachers collaborate to plan lessons that provide our LEP SWDs with appropriate and  challenging differentiated instruction via small groups during our literacy block as well as during content area instruction.             8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  The administration of P.S.12Q strongly believes that the best instruction occurs during the school day through reflective and  committed teachers.      In addition to differentiated small group instruction during the school day, P.S. 12Q has the following targeted intervention  programs for ELLs in ELA, Math, and Content Areas:     * After School Title III: This is an after-school program offered to ELLs to Grades 3-5. It addresses the literacy and mathematics  needs of those ELLs who took the NYSESLAT and received an advanced score.   * Academic Intervention Services: AIS services are provided during the school day for all ELLs who have been identified as  struggling learners. The RTI Team works with classroom teachers to integrate success monitoring before students receive  supplemental instruction. Progress is closely monitored to assess both student learning rates and student performance before  decisions are made to increase levels of intervention. Research-based materials were purchased to service Tier ll and Tier lll  students.  * Wilson Reading Program: Provided by trained instructors, in small groups. ELLs in Grades 3-5 who are Advanced/  Commanding in Speaking/ Listening and who struggle with decoding, spelling, and fluency participate in the program.    * Our intervention programs are conducted in English. We do however provide counseling services in Spanish, Bengali and in  Chinese for our ELLs who struggle academically.        9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      During the 2018-19 school year, we will continue to adjust the Parallel Teaching Model during ENL Push-In  periods.  Additionally, we have purchased the NYC Core Curriculum Passport Social Studies program, offering our ELLs access  through multiple points of entry (visual,auditory and discussion).     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72      We will not be discontinuing any programs/services for ELLs.          11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Our ELLS are always afforded equal access to all school programs. ELLs participate in all programs as their English proficient  peers. ELLs attend the following programs:     *  Wilson and Rewards Reading Programs: For students who are transitioning to commanding in Listening/Speaking skills but  need support in decoding skills  *  Title III Before and After School Programs: For Grades 2-5, Homogeneously grouped by Fountas and Pinnel Reading Levels  and/or by scale scores on NYS ELA and/or Math State Assessments  *Title lll ELA Program for ELLs in grades 2-5  * Teacher Tutoring AM/PM  * Test Prep Academy: 1/2 hour twice per week for 12 weeks for all students taking the state assessments  * Music Program: Our ELLs participate in our Music Program: Recorder for all Second Graders, 3rd -5th Grade Band, and 5th  Grade Chorus   * Free Standing After School Programs for all students: Boy Scouts and Maspeth Town Hall         12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  A variety of instructional materials are used to support ELL instruction in literacy and in the content areas. All materials are  chosen based upon their capacity to provide maximum scaffolding support.      *For the 2017-2018 school year, we  used the Pearson ReadGen Program for literacy and the GO MATH Program for  mathematics. Both programs are aligned to CCLS/Next Generation Standards and are recommended for use by the NYC DOE.  *In addition, we use native language libraries, trade books and programs from several publishers including, but not limited to:  Attanasio and Associates, Newbridge, Scholastic,  Scott Foresman and Company, Usborne/Hayes and Heinle.   *In order to facilitate instruction in the Content Areas, teachers utilize an array of free standing manipulatives as well as kits.  We obtain these from Lakeshore and Great Source Education Group.   *MyOn, A-Z Reading, Lexia and Reading Eggs are four software programs that assist our ELLs in developing fluency and content  area knowledge.  * In addition, all classrooms have been equipped with Smart Board/Promethian Technology to enhance the language  development of our students.   *Computer carts on every floor offer our ELLs easy access to technology.         13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Public School 12Q fully recognizes the importance of home language support in the acquisition of English.  Literacy in the  native language provides a pathway to literacy in English. Literacy in the home language allows our students to develop  stronger reading abilities in English.      Home language support is delivered in the following ways:  Free Standing ENL: Our Free Standing ENL Program has Home Language Support Systems.  * Students are provided with bilingual picture dictionaries in the high incident languages.  * In the upper grades, identified students are provided with Home Language Content Area Glossaries.  * Students in grades 3-5 are offered the opportunity to take the NYS Math Assessment and 4th Grade Science Assessment in  their native language. (These students are screened through our bilingual staff and through parental input.)  * During the 2017-18 school year, we continued increased our Home Language Support Libraries in grades K-5.  * Multicultural literature through our Book of the Month Program.  *Bilingual Program: Our Bilingual Program has bilingual components.  * GO MATH has been purchased in Spanish and in English for our bilingual classes   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73         * Classroom libraries in Spanish        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Required services and resources are aligned to age appropriate and grade appropriate curriculum:  * P.S. 12Q uses amplification/scaffolding strategies through high interest trade books for ELLs who struggle to meet grade level  standards.  * ENL students are serviced by ENL providers through a Push-In Model that is age and grade appropriate.  * Students that are mandated for Speech, Occupational and Physical Therapy as well as Adaptive Physical Education are  serviced in age aligned groups.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?        P.S.12 does not share a building.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   P.S. 12Q is sensitive to the needs of our newly enrolled ELLs throughout the school year. We begin by making our newly  enrolled ELLs feel safe and comfortable. Limited in English students are partnered with other native language students.  Bilingual members of our faculty provide support for our new ELLs as needed. Instruction begins immediately through visuals,  following direction activities, read alouds, listening center assignments, and through high interest-low level libraries. During  the 2016-2017 school year, teachers collaborated to developed a Newcomer Tool Kit. This Newcomer Tool Kit was  successfully  utilized during the 2017-2018 school year and will be available for use during the 2018-2019 school year.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    There are no language electives offered to our ELLs.          18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Not applicable     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  *Staff Development is available through our ENL teachers, the PD committee as well as NYC professional workshops   *Demonstration lessons are facilitated by our Literacy and Math coaches as well as our ENL teachers.   *In-house staff development takes place during Teacher Team Work, PD Mondays, Inter-Visitation Program as well as  classroom lab sites.   *Teacher teams meet every Monday to engage in cycles of inquiry to adjust curriculum and instruction based on data analysis.  *Pre-planned Teacher Team Agendas focus teacher attention to problem of practice, goals, cycles of inquiry.  *ENL teachers meet as a teacher team to plan for inquiry based objectives and to discuss best practices. Additionally, the ENL  Teacher Team shares out strategies throughout the school year through monthly newsletters and workshops.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74         *Our formal Inter-Visitation Program encourages our teachers to visit their peers' classrooms and to learn from each other.  The Principal maintains a binder of Inter-Visitations offered and attended.     Our professional develop plan is inclusive of all staff including but not exclusive to; paraprofessionals, guidance counselors,  parent coordinator, and speech therapists    *During the 2017-2018 school year, ENL Teachers participated in a series of several workshops geared towards preparing ELLs  to meet the CCLS/Next Generation Standards.   Examples of Monthly ENL Professional Development Newsletter Agendas for the 2018-2019 school year were as follows:  * September:Directed Reading/Thinking Activity  * October: Mathematically Speaking Fractions  * November: Differentiation Ideas for Multi-Level Text  * December: SQ4R  * January: ENL 2018 NYSESLAT Noticing and Implications  *February: Adjective Valentines  *March:Kinesthetic Vocabulary  * April: Personalized Speaking  *May: Dictogloss  *June: Identifying and Writing Language Objectves                2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.    Our school meets the PD requirements as per CR Part 154 as follows:  -Monthly Teacher Team Agendas highlighting Problem of Practice, Goals, and Cycles of Inquiry.  -Monthly Faculty Calendars indicating Monthly In-House PDs including Teacher-Led PDs. On a monthly basis, teachers select  from 5 In-House PDs.  -PD Committee that organizes In-House PDs.  -All teachers are encouraged to attend PDs facilitated by our borough support center. Teachers who attend “outside” PDs  complete a “This Is What I Learned” form. Teachers who attend workshops are also required to turn-key strategies to their  peers.  -Peer Inter-Visitation Program: All teachers complete a “This Is What I Do Best” form and all teachers are encouraged to  participate in our Peer-Inter-Visitation Program to share best practices.  -Demonstration Lessons facilitated by 2  Coaches  -Well Paced Observations and Timely Feedback  -For the 2018-19 school year, the following Monthly ENL Professional Development Newsletters will be as follows: Vocabulary  from a Picture, Visual Thinking Strategy Methods, Creating A Classroom Culture for Structured Interactions, Interactive Reading  Guide, Corners, Oral Cloze, Concentric Circles Strategies, and Academic Language   -Agendas and attendance records will be kept in the main office.            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          75      Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Every Tuesday, parents and students are invited to participate in workshops geared towards high expectations for learning. On  average, one hundred parents and students participate in our family workshops.  Families engage in hands-on workshops that  highlight language development in all the content areas. Our Coaches, STEM , Arts, Technology, Grade Level, and ENL Teacher  Teams regularly work with families to improve student achievement. Additionally, our ENL Teacher Team holds informational  parent meetings (twice per year) to discuss  language proficiency assessments. During all parent engagement periods, our  bilingual staff members provide translation services.       2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Our Teacher Teams and Coaches  maintain attendance records of parent meetings and workshops.     P.S. 12Q fully recognizes the importance of involving our parents in our school community. We believe that strong parent  involvement affirmatively influences student performance. Regardless of their English skills, all parents are welcome in our  school. We use our in school bilingual staff, Professional Translation Agencies, Community Based Asian  Outreach Centers as  well as the DOE's Translation Unit to assist us in parent communication. Our parent involvement program builds feelings of  trust, comfort, and cultural significance. We work collaboratively with the school community offering the parents of our  students many strategies to strengthen the academic successes of their children.  *During the 2017-2019 school years, we will continue to provide the parents of our students with a series of workshops that  support the importance of reading to their children in their native language. Parents of ELLs are invited to attend workshops  on enhancing reading comprehension in English through the use of the native language. Parents in small language groups are  coached on how to read aloud to their children.              Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.    Over eighty five percent of our students proudly speak another language other than English. Over 30 different languages represent  our diverse community contributing to our ongoing success as a high performing school.                          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          76   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.                     In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Stephanie Moskos, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          77                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   James B.

Yes/No    Nicole   Scarpitta   Parent Coordinator   No   No          * The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs  on translation,   interpretation, compliance and budget.      School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      P.S.12Q uses the HLIS, RPOB, RHLA and an internal language tracking form to assess our school's written  translation and oral interpretation needs. The administration uses our bilingual faculty members, CBO/Maspeth  Town Hall personnel, community outreach centers, the Big Word Agency and the DOE's Translation Unit to  translate oral and written parent communication. Teachers submit an internal language tracking form based on  Part lll of the HLIS to our supervising school aide to ensure that written communication is copied and sent home in  the parent's preferred language.
