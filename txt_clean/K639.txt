The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.   In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets, the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement    NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             8      Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.

The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.     Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             9      monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title   I schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             10      Section 4: SCEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Brooklyn Lab School is a positive learning environment for students and anyone who walks through the door. As a  student here, being successful means working hard, coming to school everyday, making friends who are positive  influences in your life, participating in class discussions, and getting involved in school activities. We believe that you  deserve the opportunity to have a range of choices for attending college and having a positive career. We believe that  every student should experience a loving and rigorous high school education that prepares him or her for success in  college and post-secondary life in a 21st Century world. We believe that with the right supports, expectations and  school culture, you can excel.      Our school is an environment where you will be known well and loved. You will graduate knowing that when you have  perseverance, the pursuit of knowledge, and community involvement. You will believe and know that there is nothing  that cannot be accomplished. We strive to be an institution of learning where 100% of our students are accepted to  college, confident that they have the knowledge, skills and work ethics necessary to succeed in their post graduate  studies. Our vision is to graduate our students with advanced regents diplomas, two years of college credits and an  empowered sense of self.      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Our population: Brooklyn Lab School is a high school with 462 students from 9th through 12th grade. The school  population comprises 39% Black, 53% Hispanic, 1 % White, and 7% Asian students. The student body includes 30 %  English language Learners and 23% special education students. Boys account for 64% of the students enrolled and  girls account for 36%. The average attendance rate for the school year 2017-2018 was 83 %.   Our definition of rigor: At BLS, through collaboratively creating our mission statement, we have defined rigor as  holding high expectations for our students exemplified through teaching higher-order thinking skills, utilizing  questioning and discussion techniques as practiced through AVID (Advancement via Individual Determination) as well  as promoting student centered classrooms. To implement and evaluate specific levels of rigor in the classroom, we  use both the Danielson Framework for Teaching and learning, as well as COSTA's level of questioning as per AVID . We  follow AVID's WICOR's strategy closely: writing, inquiry, collaboration, organization and reading. Teacher design their  lessons to incorporate AVID's WICOR (Writing, Inquiry, Collaboration, Organization, Reading) strategies as well as to  facilitate student led learning activities within the 5:30:10 instructional model. Teachers introduce the day's lesson (5  mins) by posing a critical thinking essential question or prompt. Students then engage in activities based on AVID's  WICOR strategies for 30 minutes which then culminates with rigor based, ten minute assessment activity.   As per our school’s mission statement, BLS is a “collaborative learning community devoted to sustaining strong  character, intellectual inquiry, college readiness, and life-long learning for all.” Thus, our classrooms emphasize  student group work and collaboration where high-level questioning should be used to guide mastery of content and  skill acquisition; our community uses our college-readiness courses to reinforce character-building; and our staff  impresses upon students the importance of continuous persistence towards achieving personal and academic goals.  In terms of curricular, pedagogical and/or assessment practices, further evidence connected to this definition include:   ● Curricula Learning Cycles: We are committed to teacher collaboration as a vehicle to enhance student learning. We  believe that if teacher teams analyzing student work products aligned to College and Career Readiness and determine  the effectiveness of their practice, then teachers will be able to improve student learning by using specific AVID  strategies. In order to do, so we have created common planning time for ICT teams (Integrated Co-teaching Teams) to  collaboratively plan engaging lessons that will meet the needs of all students. Additionally, grade teams meet weekly  to analyze and assess student work products to determine teacher effectiveness as based upon our instructional  focus, state standards, and curriculum alignment, which are all geared towards high student achievement.    2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             11      ● Pedagogy: Our entire school community has established a 5-30-10 as a school wide lesson planning and  instructional framework. The structure of 5-30-10 ensures that lessons are student centered, fosters high levels of  student engagement, and contains multiple entry points for diverse learners. Our 5-30-10 lesson plan template  includes an essential question, Do Now, modeling, activity tasks with appropriate scaffolds, and a closing. Teachers  provide feedback to students, with next learning steps consisting of comments aligned to a rubric. This year we are  focusing on developing rigorous writing assessments to improve student outcome using AVID strategies. In addition  we are rolling out the growth mindset and restorative circles to ensure that we are nurturing the entire student  through meeting their academic and social-emotional needs.    ● Assessment: Core subject teachers of all grades administered baseline assessments aligned to CCLS core units of  study and examined how to close the achievement gap and set goals for the lower-performing students. All students  are assessed by using the Department of Education Online Assessment Tool, ED performance and HNM. This data is  used along-side formative and summative assessments to determine students’ needs and learning gaps. We use  Datacation (Skedula) to break down complex student data to inform and support instruction, professional  development, curriculum planning, accountability, and policy. Teachers utilize this program to communicate grades  and infractions with students, their families, and among other colleagues and administrators.    College and Career Readiness: We have cultivated numerous partnerships to ensure our students are ready for  College and 21st Century life. Currently, we provide our students with the College Now program where students  attend college classes at Medgar Evers College and take courses through LaGuardia Community College. Similarly, our  students are participating in Long Island University's Science and Technology Program (STEP). We also offer programs  such as AP for All and iLearn to increase student exposure to rigorous instruction. New York Cares: Community  Service.   We partner with the Cypress Hills Local Development Corporation (CHLDC) to provide college and career readiness  support through the use of the Student Success Center and Early College Awareness center located on the campus.  Students are provided with the following services:     Assistance with college applications            Peer Leaders   FAFSA  SAT/ACT prep  School-wide college tours  Small group tutoring   Medgar Evers Early College Dual Credit (ECDC) Program provides college credit courses within the high school by  training high school teachers to teach 3-credit college courses. We will be offering our students at least 3 courses for  semester two in 2019. In addition, we will be partnering with Stony Brook College to provide our students with an  engineering course for semester two. We have also partnered with College Access For All, which provides additional  support for our students around college and career readiness. We are also working with C-TECH to provide students  with certification in the following fields: CPS, Telecom, Fiber, Audio/Video, etc.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Brooklyn Lab has a high percentage of English Language Learners who need additional supports with language  acquisition, preparing for state exams and understanding class material. A large percentage of students are  newcomers and have recently immigrated to the United States; these students need additional social and emotional  supports related to the experience of acculturation.      4.

As such, instruction at BLS consists of content  objectives and skill based learning. Our pedagogical practices include Cornell Note-Taking, Graphic Organizers,  Strategic Grouping, Accountable Talk, Differentiation & Performance Based Tasks. Our Assessment Practices consists  of three points for checking for understanding, Evidence Based Writing, Performance Tasks and NYC Assessments.   ● We have prioritized our focus on attendance, mental health, and on building a community school that addresses  student and family needs.    ● The above mentioned practices and/or routines align with our school community’s beliefs about how students learn  best by promoting our school’s vision which highlights collaboration, strong character, intellectual inquiry, college  readiness and life long learning.   ● The Framework is used as the foundation for our school’s mentoring, coaching, professional development, and  teacher evaluation processes. All these activities are linked together to assist our teachers in becoming more  thoughtful practitioners.                2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             13         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 19K639   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   384   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

ELT provides enriching  educational experiences that happen outside of the traditional school day and blend skill acquisition, relationship- building and fun to foster academic and social-emotional growth. Summer learning, afterschool programming, and  extended-day ELT models, when well-implemented, play a critical role in supporting students in all grades and ensuring  that they graduate from high school, college and career ready. SED requires that Priority schools offer a minimum of 200  additional student contact hours as Expanded Learning Time in addition to the current mandated length of 900 hours of  instruction per year (25 hours per week) in grades K-6 and 990 hours of instruction per year (27.5 hours per week) in  grades 7-12. Effective ELT models will blend school staff with community partners, and will provide a balanced  curriculum that can include ELA, Math, STEM, arts, physical activity, and leadership development. Complete the sections  on this page to demonstrate how the school will meet these requirements.     Part 1 – ELT Program Goal(s)   Describe the summative goal(s) of the ELT program for the 2018-19 school year.

Describe how the school will meet the following SED requirements for an ELT program in a Priority School:     Integrate academics, enrichment, and skill development through hands-on experiences that make learning  relevant and engaging.     Offer a range of activities that capture student interest and strengthen student engagement in learning so as to   promote higher attendance, reduce risk for retention or drop out, and increase the likelihood of graduation.     Actively address the unique learning needs and interests of all types of students, especially those who may   benefit from approaches and experiences not offered in the traditional classroom setting.     Contain components designed to improve student academic, social, and emotional outcomes, including   opportunities for enrichment programs such as in music and art.     Ensure instruction in any core academic subject offered in the program will be delivered under the supervision of   a teacher who is NYS certified in that particular content area.     Engage in outreach activities made to families.   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             44      Our ELT program is based on student needs and data. Currently, eighty 11 and 12th graders need ELA Regents, 66%  need Algebra Regents, 56% need Global Regents and 44% U.S History and 22% Living Environments Regents. 50% of  the population are under credited and 20% are over-age. Hence, our program consists of credit accumulation using  iLearn where students can work at home and in school. Currently, every Tuesday and Wednesday we provide  students with laptops and a teacher to assist in this process from 2:30 to 5:30pm. Saturday Academy we provide  students with Regents prep and support in writing and reading. ENL students and Special Education students are  provided with content specialist under who are licensed in the area of ESL and Special Education. This program is  supervised by the principal.

A.P. St.Louis along with the  four Grade Team Leaders use teacher feedback from meetings and professional development sessions to modify and  plan the Professional Development Calendar for the 2016-2017 school year. Our PD Team also counts on the support  of our Instructional Coaches from our Borough Field Support Center . Together, the PD Team ensures full alignment  of our instructional focus and implementation of strategies through peer observations, formal and informal  observations (by administration), coaching feedback, looking at student work protocol, curricula aligned to the  Common Core Standards, and assessment feedback. Our cabinet plans and conducts Learning Walks as a Team. The  Team then meets to discuss the outcome and identify areas of strength and growth as they pertain to our  instructional focus for the 2018-2019 school year: Evidenced by the implementation of AVID methodologies such as  Cornell Notes, and WICOR enhances with Argumentative Writing. The Team then presents its findings and next steps  with the rest of the school for feedback and evaluation. The administration uses Advance and an in house domain  tracker that measures teacher growth in different domains. Our PD Team uses this data to inform our PD calendar of  activities when deciding over school wide and targeted small group PD sessions. In addition, our Peer Collaborative  Teacher lead professional developments on Monday's after school. Lead Teacher holds workshops for our ISS  teachers and paraprofessionals during common planning time and after school. Furthermore, all new teachers have a  mentor.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             52     used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             53      Section 10: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Brooklyn Lab School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of  the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       [Brooklyn Lab School] will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             54      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

The Director will  lead implementation of the asset and needs assessment process, and other critically important coordinating  activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work.  Community Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and  services, as determined by the asset and needs assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time  (ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the  right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly  coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day.  Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to  strengthen this initiative.  Community Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and  families feel welcome, actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of  their schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community  School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this family engagement  strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work.  Community School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director,  select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual  students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use.  Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work.   2.   3.   4.

NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional  development, and 20% to OTPS.       For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and  Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Instruction  will be done in English unless provided by a teacher with a bilingual extension in English.  Students will be placed in mixed groups using their NYSESLAT levels. There will be one ENL  certified  teacher  to 15 students as well as one certified content teacher to 15 students.    Based on the data from the June Regents exams, ENL staff saw patterns including the need to  focus on word problems for the Algebra I exam as well as basic math skills.  In the after-school  classes, we will focus on improving the students basic math skills, math fluency, math literacy,  numeracy, and solving world problems.  The materials used are distinct from daily instruction.  In English, students will learn basic English skills including common everyday language and  academic language focusing on reading, writing, listening, and speaking.  The students for this  class will be all Entering and Emerging levels.  The materials will be supplemental and distinct  from materials used in daily instruction.  In science, students will use ACCESS Science to learn basic science vocabulary, skills, and  general content that would span Earth Science, Living Environment, and Biology.  The students  for this class will be Entering, Emerging, and Transitioning levels.  The materials used will be  ACCESS science which is supplemental and distinct from textbooks used in daily instruction.  After-School Title III Classes will start from October through June Wednesdays from 2:30-3:30  (Basic English), Thursdays from 2:30-4:00 (Algebra), and Fridays 2:30-3:30(Science).  The  rosters will be selected based on data including Regents exam results and teacher  recommendation.     Saturday Academy  Saturday classes will be co-taught by both content area teachers and ENL staff to provide the  best support for English language learners. Saturday school will take place during the first  semester from October, 2018 until January, 2019 and second semester from February, 2019 until  June, 2019. During Saturday School there will be one certified  content teacher and one certified  ENL teacher to every 25 students.  Materials used will be distinct from texts used in daily  instruction.   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             65         Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.     rationale  teachers to receive training          schedule and duration      name of provider   topics to be covered   Begin description here:             <!--{cke_protected}%3Cmeta%20charset%3D%22utf-8%22%20%2F%3E-->The rationale for  consulting services by Stephanie Grasso Educational Consulting  ( ISA - Institute for Student  Achievement) is to provide support for both ENL and content area teachers to differentiate texts  and create scaffolds in co-taught classes and classes taught solely by content area teachers.  The  teachers to receive training are history, science and math teachers including Mr. Schwartz, Mr.  Kozub, Mr. Ridore, Ms. Banks, Mr. Morales, Ms. Goldberg, and Mr. Viesta along with the  English department and the ENL department. The duration of the consulting services on a  monthly basis will take place from October 2018 to May 2019.  Each consulting session would  last the entire school day and include several all-staff professional development sessions to  develop topics such as differentiation, writing techniques, building academic vocabulary, and  chunking content area material. Also, each quarter of the school year ENL teachers will facilitate  after school, Monday, professional develop workshops amongst staff. The Coach Stephanie  Grasso emails Principal a log of the visits with notes from the individual session. This log is kept  electronically. This year the ENL Coach Ms. Grasso is of no cost to this program.   All agendas and attendance sheets will be kept in the principal's office.

The rationale for the ENL nights is to meet with parents one on one to discuss  transcripts, schedules and the overall progress of their child. Due to lack of engagement from the  2017-2018 and the 2016-2017 school years, we have decided to include activities for students  and their families to partake in. This includes a talent show to celebrate diversity during the first  ENL night, after the one on one conferences with parents, on October 18th, 2018, from 5:00pm- 8:00pm and a Poetry Slam, after conferences with parents on March 28th, 2019, from 5:00pm- 8:00pm. Parents will be notified of these activities, through flyer's sent monthly through mail by  our parent coordinator, phone calls made by our community worker, and messages sent through  the KINVOLVED messenger by our ENL teachers.  This year we will conduct an additional  report card distribution and progress report distribution, one to be held on February 7th  2019  from 5pm - 7:30 pm ( Report card distribution) and the other being a Progress report  distribution on May 2nd 2019 from 5pm - 7:30 pm.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  *In the fall spring, all ELLs are given the ELL Periodic Assessment. The date is then distributed to all teachers. Teachers then, in  turn, use the data to provide individual and group supports. ELL teachers use this data to modify their curriculum and unit  plans. Aside from English literacy skills, we use the Spanish LAB to evaluate all Spanish-speaking new admits in their native  language literacy. 100 percent of new admits identified as eligible for the NYSITELL have been administered the exam and  placed appropriately. Also, 100 percent of new Spanish-speaking ELLs have been administered the Spanish LAB and this has  been used in conjunction with the LENS and the parent interview to determine if the students are SIFE for languages other  than Spanish.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             70         The ELL Department created a schedule for the fall ELL Periodic Assessment in October 2018. All new ELLs identified will take  the periodic assessment by creating a spreadsheet of all students and their results as well as a timeline of when it will be done  and who will be responsible for administering it.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The school utilizes the ELL periodic assessment in the fall and the spring semesters to identify baseline skills in reading and  math, progress, and areas of need. In addition, all students will be administered English competency in reading comprehension  schoolwide. These datapoints will be shared with all staff members for grouping and measures of progress.        4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    The school has regular inquiry meetings as well as a data specialist to make note of patterns, areas of strength and areas of  improvement.  This information with the Inquiry Team members also include ELL teachers.  This will be shared with the  teachers and the Professional Development Team to rollout data-based workshops targeting the areas of need.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   The school utilizes the RtI Guide focusing on screening students for skills, stengthening the instructional core, targeted  instruction and monitoring the progress of students. Teachers from the ELL and English Department and Foreign Language  Department attended a professional development session about how to integrate language progressions and language  objectives into daily lessons to provide students with academic language and strategies to strengthen the focus of each lesson.  Targeted instruction looks like differentiated instruction through team-taught classes and scaffolding via results from the ELL  periodic assessments. Finally, the inquiry team alongside the ELL department will monitor progress throughout the year.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The NYSESLAT, ELA Regents, History and Science and Math Regents are outcome assessments that the Inquiry and Professional  Development Teams utilize to evaluate and inform ELL programming.  The school decided to have push-in services for Regents- based history courses, an ELL push-in Ecology class as well as creating a four semester algebra course for students who lack  basic math skills including the majority of the ELLs.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   We review our ELL data as a school community during Professional Development and in inquiry team meetings. The data is  then used by teachers in their Inquiry teams to modify units and lessons by providing students with graphic organizers, word  walls as well as academic word walls, small group instructions, readings appropriate for their proficiency level, and reading  materials in native language.            Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   1. Freestanding ENL program are implemented through both standalone and co-teaching/push-in models. The 9-10  and 11-12 graders are in both separate Entering and Emerging standalone classes according to their grades for two or   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             71         one period each day respectively. All students are placed in ELA classes in a push-in model on all grades: 9, 10, 11, and  12 separately. There is also pus-in ELL services in the Ecology and Global History courses due to data from the 2018- 2097 Regents.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A           2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Explicit ENL classes are delivered in integrated ELA and ENL classes per grade level with certified ENL teachers for all current  ELL students (235 minutes). ENL standalone is delivered with two grade bands, 9-10 and 11-12 for Entering and Emerging  classes, two periods a day (470 minutes) and one period a day (235 minutes) respectively. One Entering/Emerging period per  day will be a push-in Ecology course to build the student's knowledge of science literacy.         3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Core content is delivered by certified core content teachers, who work in conjunction with certified ENL teachers to meet the  instructional needs of our ELLs. Our English Department is working with Core Curriculum Collections this year. The Core  Curriculum comes with primary sources, selections of text, high interest library and videos.We use academic word walls,  immersion in content vocabulary, Spanish English dictionary, text in native language , Google Translate and ENL teachers are  using the SIOP model in their classrooms. ESL Teachers work in conjunction with the content area teacher and apply strategies  such as small group instruction, use of technology, create graphic organizers, small group read aloud and vocabulary  immersion.           4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   The school ensures that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languges throughout the year by creating a tracking  system via Google Docs. Utilizing the Spanish LAB and the LENS, ELL teachers can assess their knowledge of their native  languages within three weeks of enrollment. Along with the assessment data, the teachers utilize the HLIS and interview  information to make decisions about students' progress.          5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a) Presently our school is using the workshop model, therefore all teachers group students heterogenously based on data  provided by the ELL periodic assessment. ENL teachers are practicing the SIOP Model in the classroom. After reviewing data of  our ELL subgroups many were placed into ICT classes in other content areas classes. The Special Educators assist in supporting  these students with giving small group instructions, multi-level reading material, and technology such as IPADS and laptops.  We also offer a Saturday Enrichment class that focuses on Global literacy, we created a dual language class where students   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             72      work with two teachers receiving reading and writing skills with a focus on Global studies. This was created after reviewing the  data. Our instructional plan for SIFE students is to give them access to an online computer software program called  USALearns.net. This is a basic English program created for adults to build their English skills at school or home. Additionally, we  offer English literacy and math literacy courses after school.    B) Newcomers participate in an Ambassador Program in which newly arrived ELL students are paired with current/former ELLs  to provide academic and emotional support for students. Furthermore, AIDP provides Bangla- and Spanish-speakers with a  social emotional group that supports them both academically and socially. Newcomers receive instructional materials in  English and their native languages so that they can build their understanding of the content. They use iPads and dictionaries in  the classroom. The school has copies of instructional texts in Spanish which are instrumental for students in science and  history.    c) Developing students receive differentiated instruction in the content areas    d) Long-term ELLs receive specific academic language support in the classroom focusing on literacy skills. Teachers provide  scaffolding with sentence stems and modelling to build their acadmic literacy.    e) Former ELLs receive instructional assistance through their Global History courses based on their scores on the past year's  Regents scores. Some former ELLs also participate in a PGC class with Entering and/or Emerging ELLs who experience challenge  in acculturating to the United States.        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Our ELL-SWD students are place in ICT classes where there are two teachers. The Special Education teachers provide support  such as graphic organizers,, technology support and parallel teaching(small-group instruction), IPADs, ST Math Online Program,  Google translate, laptops, Computer room, smart board, video lessons. All ELL-SWD students are programmed according to the  mandates on their IEP. They receive ENL services in standalone classes currently. In cases where the IEP mandates supercedes  ENL mandates and cannot received all of their minutes. Students are placed into our Saturday Global literacy Enrichment class.         7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  We have ICT classes, modify curricular as per student data, IEP teachers monitor and send out goal progress report to parents,  and all ELL\SWD 9th Grade students are placed in double period English and double period math classes. ELL\SWD students are  placed in ICT classes as per data attain during a child's annual IEP or Triennual meeting. At the meeting parents are presented  with the data collected both form teacher observations, formal and informal assessment as well as parent voice and student's  academic and social capbilities. At the meeting CSE team present the options to child's families based on the data. The parent  then has 10 days to accept or contest the placement.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  1. Social Studies targeted intervention : Saturday ENL enrichment program focused on Global literacy, Social studies prep  classes on Saturdays and after-school by content teachers- Ell\SWD, SIFE, long Term Ells  2. Science targeted intevention: Prep classes on Saturday and after-school  3. ELA targeted intervention : We have invested in the Core curriculum which high interest classroom libraries, video, and  multi-level reading excerpts.  4. Math targeted intervention - prep classes after-school and small tutoring groups with teachers.     2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             73              9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Based on the June US History and Global History Regents results, those two areas are the largest concerns because the pass  rates were very low. The ELL students knowledge of pre-algebra skills in math are also very lacking. The school will change  programming so that Algebra I will be offered over four semesters for students who have low math literacy so that students  can have more time to learn basic skills. Along with this, history courses will have an integrated ELL teacher to support the ELLs  in these Regents classes.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   Paste response to question here: n/a       11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All ELL students are allowed and encouraged to participate in all programs offered to our whole student population.  1. Saturday Academy- consist of students recovering credits from course they previously failed in the following Science, Math,  Global Studies, English, Physical Education and our Global Literacy Enrichment program that target our ELLs who have not yet  passed their Global regents exams or will be taking it in their 10th grade year. The program focuses on building literacy skills in  the social studies curriculum from 9am - 1pm  2. Cosmetology- all students are invited to participate. Students learn how to apply makeup  3. American Sign Language - Students learn how to sign  4. PSAL sports teams- all students are invited to try out for the teams. We have basketball, soccer, baseball, volleyball, tennis,  cricket, softball, swimming, and etc.        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs?

Instructional materials used to support ELLs include:    Math - Algebra and Pre-Algebra flashcards  Science - Smart Science, multilingual and interactive online lab resource  English - HMH Collections online student access  History - Spanish textbooks     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   ENL students are encouraged to use home language during class time. We provide bilingual dictionaries in Spanish, Bangla,  Urdu, and Arabic. We use Google translate. We provide materials in home language and allow students to write responses in  home language.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    After careful review of student transcript, academic progress and teacher observation ELLs are placed according to their grade  level and their proficiency level via the NYSELAT. After reviewing the data, students are enrolled in the appropriate support  programs. A parent meeting is held to explain the school's decision and we encourage parent input and support. The ELL  Coordinator works closely with the principal and guidance counselors to ensure all students are placed appropriately after  NYSITELL testing and the parent interview.            15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?     2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             74         The ELL Coordinator at Brooklyn Lab School works closely with Cypress Hills Collegiate High School, and Multicultural High  School and communicate often. They collaborate for the annual parent meeting each year.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   The school has an ELL Ambassador Program as well as a Peer Group Connection class to support newly enrolled ELLs  throughout the school year. Ms. Lee and Ms. Bruno participate in teaching and establishing both programs to meet the needs  of these students' social emotional needs. The ELL Ambassador Program matches each new ELL with a current/former ELL. The  ELL Ambassadors are trained to assist students and meet with Ms. Lee each week for the first few months of the school year to  build community. The Peer Group Connection class has former ELLs who are trained to work with newly enrolled students in  an elective class to build social emotional skills. In addition, AIDP offers two native language groups after school for Spanish  and Bangla speaking students to work as a support group based on the students' needs.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?   Paste response to question here: AP Spanish       18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.

At least one ELL teacher will be on the school's Professional Development Team and present to the entire staff for 15% of the  school year. The Peer Collaborative Teacher and an AP will keep the records of the year's plan and the sign-in sheets and  agendas in a binder. The school has purchased Edivate which is content-specific which will cover topics including English  Language Learners. Also, the ELL teachers will collaborate and plan what to turnkey to the staff after attending PDs on Monday  afternoons. ELL teachers have access to PD workshops and institutes according to Brooklyn North Field Support Center  offerings each month and the DELLSS weekly newsletter sent via email to disseminate information and PD workshop offerings  to satisfy 50% of professional development requirements.         2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             75      Parental Involvement   1.

Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   The school collaborates with the other four schools in the building for the annual individual parent meeting. The schools  provide oral translation for both Bangla and Spanish-speaking parents. Each parent receives a folder including the NYSESLAT  testing result breakdown, attendance records, transcripts, and graduation requirements. There is an introductory session to  discuss the goals of the ELL programs and then parents choose a breakout session. The breakout sessions include how to read  the NYSESLAT testing results and each student's language proficiency, attendance records, transcripts and requirements for  graduation.   2.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Gerard Henry, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             77                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Brooklyn Lab School                                                                              School DBN: 19K639  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Home language survey. ATS reports, Teacher Survey, and emergency blue cards are used to assess our school's  written translation and oral interpretation needs. Parents of new students and entering 9th grade students are  interviewed in their native language or through translation of the native language. All of our incoming students  this year have indicated English, Spanish Bangla, urdu, Arabic , Hindi and Punjabi as their preferred language.
