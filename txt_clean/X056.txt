This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   “Our mission is to educate the whole child, develop his/her self-esteem, social responsibility, sense of community,  values, mental and physical health, citizenship, and instill a lifelong love of reading and learning. As a school  community, we are guided by our belief that all students can achieve and we must all strive to always be better  than our last best. We will accomplish our mission through collaborative planning, parent and community  involvement, and respect for all members of the P.S. 56 community. It is our goal to make our school an exciting  place to learn and work.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   During the first 3 weeks of school, all students (K - 5) discuss and establish their learning goals for the current school  year. Students in grades 1 - 5 revisit their work in their portfolios and reflect, before they establish their goals for the  new school year. Students and teachers chart criteria and create the appropriate rubrics to measure students’ level of  proficiency on tasks which may include independent reading, homework, writing proficiency, behavior, listening skills,  accountable talk, unit of study task completion, competitions.   Since 2009, students in grades 3, 4 and 5 have participated in the on-line interactive reading comprehension program  Achieve3000. This program is aligned with the NYS Next Generation standards, and college and career readiness is  embedded in the analysis of student data. The program differentiates for a range of reading levels, but maintains  grade level non-fiction content. The program reflects instructional shifts in learning each year and is available to  parents. Workshops are given to parents to support their children’s participation in this program. The program is  accessible to children both at home and in school, including weekends and summer months. Since 2004, our students  in grades K - 5 have participated in the Junior Great Books program. This program is designed to strengthen higher  order critical thinking skills, through a shared inquiry discussion. Parent workshops are given by staff and students  demonstrating the shared inquiry process. Teachers also use EngageNY Core Knowledge Literacy Skills Lessons  (Grades K - 2) and Expeditionary Learning (Grades 3 - 5) to support teacher created units of study to integrate learning  across all subjects. Learning goals are reflected upon throughout, and at the end, of each unit. This practice enables  great opportunities for teaching efficacy and student self-reflection. At all times, students are invited to turn and talk  and learn through cooperative learning partnerships.    We believe that parents are their children's first and forever teachers and play a vital role in their children’s academic  success and social-emotional growth. Our strong home-school connection ensures we are a culture of high  expectations. Parents are recognized at the end of every school year for their ongoing support and involvement in  their children's school life. All parents whose children 90% of the time are in school, on time, in uniform, homework  done and have completed the 40 book response school standard are recognized and celebrated in June. Recognition  includes the presentation of certificates and personalized pens.    Competitions are scheduled throughout the school year and offer students a variety of opportunities to grow as  learners while building self-esteem and confidence, and strengthening their math computation and problem-solving  skills, reading, writing, listening and speaking skills.   We are committed to meeting the physical, emotional and social needs of every child, as well as ensuring their  academic growth and achievement. Social Emotional Learning is embedded in our curriculum. Our integrated units of  study, the Junior Great Program (grades K - 5) and our Making Thinking Visible Routines provide daily opportunities  for students to strengthen their communication skills, while building their ability to empathize, problem solve and  think critically. Pedagogues trained in PBIS meet regularly to implement school-wide practices and programs to help  our students learn the skills they need to successfully navigate our world socially and emotionally. Our partnership  with the New York Road Runners organization and our participation in their Rising New York Road Runners program,  as well as Move to Improve, support the physical development of our students and a lifelong commitment to daily  exercise. Our club programs also provide opportunities for our students to explore areas of interest that contribute to  the development of the whole child, which is our mission. This year, 2018 - 2019, P.S. 56 will continue to participate in  the School Mental Health Consultant Program. The School Mental Health Consultant Program (SMHCP) is part of  ThriveNYC, the City’s strategic plan to improve and promote the mental health of its residents. Integrated field trips  allow students to participate in purposeful hands-on learning opportunities.   Through our partnership with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, the Metropolitan Opera Guild and the Bronx  Arts Ensemble, our students are afforded the opportunity to participate in high level music programs (dance, vocal  and instrumental) and gain an appreciation and understanding of the performing arts.    ● Supports for teachers include ongoing actionable professional learning.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      ● Partnerships with families include parent-teacher conferences, open school nights, parent workshops given by staff,  PA and parent coordinator, adult ELL classes, and student council sponsored Family Book Bingo, Arts and Crafts  evenings, Family Fun Fitness events, and Family Movie nights, and invitations to be part of class trips, competitions  and student performing arts presentations.    ● Achieve3000 provides periodic feedback to students, teachers and parents regarding students’ reading progress  towards college and career readiness.        3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   P.S. 56 – The Norwood Heights School is an elementary school grades K through 5 with 672 students presently  enrolled of which 100% are Title 1 eligible. Our rich diversity is represented by 20.68% Asian, 8.48% Black, 62.20%  Hispanic, 2.23% Native American, and 5.80% White students. This is inclusive of 15.48% English Language Learners  and 22.32% students with Individual Education Plans (IEPs). Our students with disabilities and our students who are  English language learners need additional programs and interventions to support their academic progress and  proficiency in English Language Arts and mathematics.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Impact of this work, thus far:    The 2017 - 2018 School Quality Guide Report 2017-2018 indicates:     P.S. 56 exceeded target in Rigor in Instruction (4.91).    P.S. 56 exceeded target in Collaborative Teachers (4.63).    P.S. 56 exceeded target in Effective School Leadership (4.33).    P.S. 56 exceeded target in Trust (4.52).    P.S. 56 meeting target in Strong Family-Community Ties (3.89).   This evidence indicates the positive impact of our work to date.    As a school community, P.S. 56 has honed in on Danielson’s Framework for Teaching Domain 3 (rigorous instruction),  specifically 3b (using questioning and discussion techniques) and 3c (engaging students in learning). For our  Professional Learning Community time on Mondays, our Professional Learning Committee developed cycles of  learning to improve our practice to reach our instructional goals for our students (Collaborative Teachers). Based on  current NYS data, we are focusing on improving student outcomes in mathematics. We continue to be dedicated to  refining our math instruction, engaging our students in ambitious intellectual activities to strengthen students' higher  order critical thinking skills and problem-solving skills (Rigorous Instruction). The focus of our professional learning  cycles include: deepening our understanding of the strategies, practices and programs that promote and strengthen  the social - emotional learning of all our students (SEL) through PBIS and Turnaround For Children (Supportive  Environment), the analysis of all student data to improve practice and student learning, guided reading and strategy  group Instruction in literacy, strengthening higher order critical thinking skills through Reciprocal Teaching, Making  Thinking Visible Routines and Junior Great Books, and professional study into meeting the needs of our students who  are English New Language learners and our children with disabilities and students at-risk through Advanced Literacy.    All pedagogues access student soft and hard data. During the first 25 days of school, historical data, including  formative and summative assessments, are compared to students’ baseline assessments for the new school year. This  analysis is used to establish a tier level and appropriate academic and socio-emotional supports needed and a plan of  instruction for each student. Through goal setting meetings, grade level planning meetings and parent-teacher  meetings, pedagogues establish the best practices and differentiated instruction for multiple entry points that  address students’ learning strengths and needs. Academic interventions supplement school instruction, as needed.  They include 24 Saturday Academy Program sessions Grades 3, 4 and 5 (first six Saturday sessions are designed for   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      Students With Disabilities and English Language learners and the last three are for grade 2 only); After School  Homework Help Program Grades K -5; Breakfast Book Club Grades 1, 2 and 3; Morning English Language Learners  (ELLs) Program Grades 2 -5, Academic Tutorial Time Grades 1 – 5, Kindergarten Extended Day Program, Grade 2  Saturday Program. Short term goals are set and students are assessed regularly to measure progress and to adjust  supports given.    ● The P.S. 56 2018 NYS ELA data indicated that all students, including the lowest performing students, showed  excellent improvement.   ● The 2018 NYS ELA and math tests data indicates that 52.1% of our students met State standards on the State  English test, as compared to the City average 46.6% and the District average 33%, and 47.3% of our students met  State math test standards, as compared to City average 42.7% and the District average 26.7%.   ● Our P.S. 56 2017 - 2018 School Quality Guide report indicates that P.S. 56 has exceeded the City and district average  in all six elements of the framework.    ● The results of our 2014-2015 Quality Review reflect that P.S. 56 is well-developed for all indicators rated.    ● To date, the impact has been positive student engagement, with increased instructional time. Academic progress  will continuously be measured within specified time frames.   The dedication and love of the entire P.S. 56 school community to the children we serve and our school-wide  commitment to academic excellence are never compromised. We continue to remain true to our mission statement “  to educate the whole child, develop his/her self-esteem, social responsibility, sense of community, values, mental and  physical health, citizenship, and instill a lifelong love of reading and learning. We will accomplish our mission through  cooperative planning, both short and long-term, parent and community involvement, meaningful staff development,  and respect for all members of the P.S. 56 community. It is our goal to make our school an exciting place to learn and  work ”, regardless of the challenges that may be present. It is our goal that every child attending P.S. 56 feels well- known and respected by our staff. Our data has a face – the faces of our students. With the continued strong home- school connection, these faces will be both college and career ready, as well as productive, critically thinking adults in  the future.    This 2018 - 2019 school year, in addition to our ongoing dedication to academic excellence and achievement for all  of our students, we are focusing on the social emotional learning of our school community and implementing  specific programs and practices to ensure our students have the skills and strategies they need to understand and  manage their emotions, empathize, and establish and maintain positive relationships and make responsible  decisions.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 10X056   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   0K,01,02,03,04,05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   704   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

In order to continue the student exemplar growth, as noted in our well-developed Quality Review, we have  conducted an analysis of student performance data on all grade level assessments. This data collection was conducted  in June at the end of the 2017-2018 school year. With regards to rigorous instruction, our NYS ELA and mathematics  data indicates that our students have gained 10% increase in the number of students achieving levels 3 and 4 in ELA.  Our SWD population have gained a 12% increase in the number of students achieving levels 3 and 4 in ELA. Our ENL  population gained a 12% in the number of students achieving levels 3 and 4 in ELA. This data evidences the success of  implementing integrated units of study, Making Visible Routines and the Junior Great Books program school-wide. In  mathematics, the data indicates that students gained a 4% incr4ease in the number of students achieving levels 3 and  4. Our SWD gained a 4.1% increase in the number of students achieving levels 3 and 4. Data for our ENL population  indicates a 1.7% decrease in the number of students achieving level 3 and 4 in math. It was determined that specific  plans for screening and providing tiered instruction and interventions for students at-risk would help ensure a culture  for learning in every classroom and improved student outcomes for all students, specifically our ENL students..

Strategies to address the needs of students with  disabilities, English language learners, and other high- need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited,  SIFE, STH).   To instill a lifelong love of reading and learning, we will continue  to offer an After School Help Program to assist students with  homework and provide physical and interactive academic  activities, Smarty Ants, Achieve 3000, Ticket To Read and other  interactive technology programs, to support their development.  These programs target students who have struggled to complete  homework and enables them the time, resources and support to  meet the learning objectives of each assignment.   Teachers working the After School Help program are expected to  monitor and record student completion of daily assignments to  share with administration and classroom teachers every day.  Parents receive a weekly report regarding their children's  progress.   All data from our interactive technology programs is collected,  analyzed and disseminated to all stakeholders.   Adult education classes in ELL, supported by technology, will  continue to give parents the opportunity to enhance their own  learning and in turn support their children’s academic  development to ensure their children develop a lifelong love of  reading and learning.    Baseline and endline assessments are administered to  participants to monitor the implementation of this program.

For our Professional Learning Community  time on Mondays, our Professional Learning Committee has  developed cycles of learning to improve our practice to reach our  instructional goals for our students. To improve student  outcomes, we are dedicated to refining the teaching of reading  and writing, while also engaging our students in ambitious  intellectual activities to strengthen students' higher order critical  thinking skills. The focus of our cycles includes: the strategies and  programs that strengthen social-emotional learning skills, the  analysis of all student data to improve practice and student  learning, strengthening higher order critical thinking skills  through Making Thinking Visible Routines and Junior Great  Books, and professional study into meeting the needs of children  with disabilities and students at-risk, as well as English New  Language learners. Cognizant that parents are the first and  forever teachers of their children and valuable members of our  learning community, staff will turn-key visible thinking strategies  at parent workshops.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 56, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.          Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   P.S. 56, The Norwood Heights School, will support parents and families of Title I students by:   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      P.S. 56's Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and Students With Disabilities. The P.S.  56 school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.          Parental Involvement and School Quality   In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  P.S. 56 Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team,  were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional  input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, P.S. 56 will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the P.S. 56 Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator to serve as a liaison between the school and families. The Parent Coordinator will  provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will  work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also  maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;      Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.          School-Parent Compact (SPC)   P.S. 56 , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is  implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between  the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I,  agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for  improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure  that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

This is driven by  NYSESLAT results.  Our Saturday Academy for grades 3, 4, & 5 is for the ELLs and their  language proficiency.  Saturday Academy for ELLs runs 6 weeks beginning October 20th until  December 8th, excluding holiday weekends.  Student instruction by three Content teachers and  three ENL teachers is from 8:30 A.M. to 12:00 P.M.  Administration is assigned to supervise this  program.  There is no other Saturday program scheduled during this time.  Co- planning time for  three Content teachers and three ENL teachers is from 12 noon to 12:30 p.m. The ELLs are  grouped homogeneously based on their levels.  All instruction is in English and provided by 3  certified ELL teachers.  Materials that are used include Side by Side books, Phonics and Word  Study, Vocabulary Links, and Reading A-Z.  Students practice conversational language in  everyday situations using Side by Side text.  Instructional texts, Phonics and Word Study,  Vocabulary Links and Reading A-Z are used to increase vocabulary, comprehension and fluency  using reading and writing activities.   The role of the three content teachers (Mary Goldman,  Tara Gritz, Tashima Nole)  is to support the academic growth of our ENL.  These teachers work  on strengthening the fundamental skills needed for reading proficiency (phonics, phonemic  awareness and fluency).  In addition, these content area teachers also build students' speaking  and listening vocabulary.  Programs such as Readinga-z, Award, Achieve3000 and Voyager  learning Ticket to Read are implemented when student data indicates these programs are the  appropriate support.  This supplemental program has been developed and implemented to further  the language proficiency and growth of our ENL students.  Periodic assessments are given to  measure and determine individual growth.  Assessments in fluency, sight word recognition and  the Diagnostic Reading Assessment determine student growth in these specific areas.       Our supplemental program for our ENL students includes servicing students in grades 3, 4  and 5 in the following subgroups:  SIFE (TBD), Newcomers (TBD), as well as servicing the  language proficiency needs of the following students in grades 3, 4 and 5: Entering (TBD),  Emerging (TBD), Transitioning (TBD), Expanding (TBD), Commanding (TBD).

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  DRA is the schoolwide local assessment tool for all students including ENLs and SWD.  The quantitative data from this Fall  assessment is the baseline that indicates the instructional tier at which each student K, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 is beginning.  For ELLs  this data is analyzed along with the data from the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT.  The measure of student growth from  2016 NYSESLAT results indicated that students achieved in the following levels: 6 Entering, 29 Emerging, 25 Transitioning, 39  Expanding and 5 Commanding.  The NYSITELL results for students entering school during the 2016-2017 school year indicated  that students achieved in the following levels: 18 Entering, 1 Emerging, 5 Transitioning 6 Expanding.  Periodic data from  ongoing formative assessments such as content based projects, Reading, Math, Science and Social Studies midterms are used  to evaluate student progress and drive differentiated instruction and planning.  Strategies are developed that will support  students in the areas that are deficient.  This data is also used to plan academic intervention services for students.  Response   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62         to interventions are monitored and shared among service providers regularly to improve student performance.  Students who  perform higher on DRA have a stronger grasp of phonemic awareness, decoding and comprehension, and are prepared to  achieve greater proficiency on the NYSESLAT.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Continuous assessments are conducted periodically and recorded in GoogleDocs.  Using this data, teachers are able to plan  next steps and best programs for students.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Success is determined by student progress.  Students' progress is assessed regularly within each academic trimester using DRA,  midterm and final exams in all content areas, periodic assessments in ELA and Math, teacher observations, and all formative  and summative in-class assessments.  Flexible grouping allows students to be placed in appropriate instructional tiers based on  their RtI (response to intervention), as needed.        4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Continuous assessments are conducted periodically and recorded in GoogleDocs.  Using this data, teachers are able to plan  next steps and best programs for students.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Student classwork is reviewed and progress is monitored and updated regularly.  Teachers and administration meet to discuss  success of  RtI and parents are invited to discuss interventions, progress made and supports still needed.  In the classroom, all  students including ENLs are tiered for differentiated instruction based on formative data including DRAs, content area projects,  midterms and finals.  In addition, based on the data ENLs receive supplemental services, such as Saturday Academy, Extended Day, and ENL  Extended Day Morning Program, Great Leaps.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   2016 NYSESLAT results indicate that students achieved in the following levels: 6 Entering, 29 Emerging, 25 Transitioning, 39  Expanding and 5 Commanding.  The NYSITELL results for students entering school during the 2016-2017 school year indicated  that students achieved in the following levels:  18 Entering, 1 Emerging, 5 Transitioning, 6 Expanding.  For the 62% of our ELLs  who are at Entering, Emerging and Transitioning levels, there is still a need for additional support to ensure student  progress.  Based on this analysis and formative assessments, students are supported in the areas of reading and writing  everyday.  This data drives planning for extra services offered newcomers and long-term ELLs (i.e. Morning Program, Extended  Day, After School Help Program).  Students who perform higher on DRA, achieve greater proficiency on the  NYSESLAT.  Inversely, students on the low achieving level, are identified for interventions with specific prescriptions for  learning and achievement.       Newcomers (non-English speaking students) are generally scoring at an Entering level.  Kindergarten NYSITELL scores vary  from Entering to Expanding.        7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Continuous assessments are conducted periodically and recorded in GoogleDocs.  Teachers are able to plan next steps and  best programs for students.         Part IV: ELL Programming     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63      Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.  Freestanding ENL Program:  - Stand alone ENL develops English language skills so that students can succeed in core content courses.  Students  may not receive stand alone ENL in lieu of core content area instruction.  - Integrated ENL instruction builds English language skills through content area instruction.  It is delivered by a dually  certified teacher or co-teaching by ENL teacher and content area teacher.  Delivery of Instruction:  a.  There are three self-contained ENL classrooms with a certified ENL teacher in each, grades K, 1 and 3rd.  For the  ENL students in grades 1 through 5 that are not in self-contained ENL classrooms, they participate in the ENL pull-out  program.  The pull-out ENL teacher scaffolds instruction according to students’ assessed needs and in concert with  classroom instruction using TPR, technology and other ENL techniques.  Our organizational models include self- contained, push-in and pull-out models.    b.  The classes are heterogeneously mixed by grade level.      b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A     c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              Kindergarten, 1  st   and 3rd  grade have the self contained model.  ELLs are grouped in an ENL class for the entire day  and for all content instruction.  Grades 4 & 5, and all self-contained class students (who are also ELLs)  follow the pull out  model.  ELLs spend the majority of the day in classroom and are brought together from various classes for English acquisition  instruction.  Grade 2 follows the push-in model.  To ensure that ENL students are provided the mandated number of instructional minutes according to their proficiency level,  there is a specific ENL instructional schedule.  *  ELL students at Entering and Emerging levels receive 360 minutes of ENL instruction and 390 minutes of ELA instruction per  week.  *  ELL students at Transitioning and Expanding levels receive 180 minutes of ENL instruction and 570 minutes of ELA  instruction per week.  * Students who have achieved Commanding level receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL instruction and 660 minutes of ELA  instruction per week.               3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      All ENL programs, both the self-contained and pull-out program at P.S. 56, are aligned to the Common Core Learning  Standards.   Some of the components of the school wide balanced literacy program are Read Aloud, Shared Reading,  Independent Reading, Writing Workshop, grade level content area instruction and materials.  Content area is integrated into  the reading and writing workshop which enables ENL students to make connections to their prior experiences and language is  learned in a meaningful context.  We use the SIOP model – (Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol).  Lesson plans include  both content objectives as well as language objectives.        Our ENL teacher is actively involved in the development of our reading, writing, and integrated units of study.  As both the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64      push-in ENL teacher for grade 2 and the pull-out ENL teacher (grades 4 and 5 and ELL students in self-contained SE programs),  our ENL teacher works closely with the classroom teachers (both monolingual and self-contained ENL kindergarten, grades 1  and 3 teachers) determining learning goals based on the Common Core Learning Standards and grade level student  performance indicators and competencies in ELA, Mathematics and all core subject areas, along with NYS ELL Standards and  grade level student performance indicators and competencies.  These teachers all meet once a week during a common  planning time to discuss student assessments to differentiate and plan next teaching steps.  Our ENL teacher helped  developed and follows our integrated units of study curriculum for grades K through 5, which includes the science and social  studies content areas.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      When registering, if the ELLs native language is Spanish then the LAB is administered in Spanish.  If the native language is  other than Spanish, we use available classroom resources, previous report cards, and translators to help determine students'  academic abilities in their native language.            At PS 56 the instructional language is English. ELLs are evaluated in English throughout the school year to ensure  progress.  School dictionaries are available in several languages to support student learning.  For newcomers,  ELL buddies who  speak the preferred language are assigned in classroom for support.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Differentiated Instruction for our ELL Subgroups:  a.  SIFE: Students with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE) and long term ELLs are supported through our AIS and ENL  modalities.  All data available from each formal educational experience is accumulated.  Students’ current abilities and needs  are assessed and additional supports are implemented accordingly.  Each SIFE receives:  •     ENL instruction according to NYSESLAT indicator  •     AIS services supplement the mandated ENL instruction.  This takes the form of various supplemental programs offered to  each grade level i.e. Breakfast Club (Grade 1), ENL Extended Day Morning Program Grades 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, ENL Saturday  Academy and all Saturday Academy programs offered throughout the school year (grades 2 through 5), Kindergarten  Academy, Kindergarten  and Grade 1 small group pull-out AIS in reading and math, guided AIS push in reading, critical thinking  and problem solving.  •     ENL teacher and classroom teacher collaborate, and grade level curriculum is integrated with the ENL program.  In order to  meet students’ needs, assessments will be ongoing throughout the school year.  b.  ENL students in school for less than three years and our ELLs requiring ELA testing will receive all of the above supports.  c.  ELLs receiving services for 4 to 6 years are considered at risk and receive additional academic services to supplement ENL  instruction including, ENL Extended Day Morning Program, Breakfast Club, Extended Day program and Saturday Academy.  d.  ELLs are supported with their mandated ENL service, as well as receiving AIS.  They are also invited to participate in morning  programs and Saturday programs that support language acquisition while integrating content areas.  At this time, there are no  longterm ELLs.  e.  Students reaching proficiency on the NYSESLAT continue to receive support through ongoing monitoring of student  assessment data and the opportunity to participate in all programs offered to all students, including ELLs, throughout the  year.  Former ELLs are given the mandated time and a half for testing.  They are eligible for this accommodation for two years  after passing the NYSESLAT.       6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   ELL students with special needs who have IEPs will receive differentiated instruction as indicated above based on student’s IEP  and collaborative planning meetings between ENL teacher and classroom teacher.  Computer programs that are language- based are used to assist in learning.  Interactive computer programs that are language-based are used to assist in learning.  All   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65      students including ELLs and SWDs have access to (software) interactive programs that are programmed to their reading  levels.  They include Ticket to Read, Voyager V-Math, Achieve 3000, Reading A-Z and Go Math Academy.               7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?   The ELL-SWDs are grouped with students who are the same language proficiency level.  This is determined by the NYSESLAT  scores as well as informal observations of the ELL-SWDs' ability.  The ELL-SWDs are serviced for ENL with their non-disabled  grade level peers everyday.  IEPs determine ICT placement.  ENL services are provided as per NYSESLAT and NYSITELL  scores.  Students with IEPs will be evaluated by the Language Proficiency Team( LPT) and recommendations will be made to  determine  ELL services.         8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Academic Intervention Services (AIS) provide differentiated instruction for ELLs during the ENL Extended Day Morning Program  (Grade 1 – 5) which includes non-fiction materials and resources that integrate Social Studies and Science into the grade level  ENL instruction, ENL Breakfast Book Club for Grades 1and 2 students, Extended Day Afternoon Program and Saturday  Academies. During the school day, differentiated instruction is provided through small group pull-out instruction, Achieve3000  nonfiction reading intervention program (reading selections are calibrated to each student's individual reading level),  or 1:1  Great Leaps Program with AIS teachers in which several ELLs participate based on need.  In addition, we are continuing to use  the Award Reading Program and the Voyager Learning VMath online program.  Students have at-home access to these online  programs as well.  Saturday Academies are offered in ELA and Math for all students in Grades 3, 4 and 5 and a NYSESLAT  Saturday Academy for ELL students to strengthen their language skills and use of strategies in the context of the NYSESLAT  exam.  The New York State Mandated ENL/ELA allocated instruction time based on student proficiency level is part of the ELLs’  daily instruction.  ELLs are grouped homogeneously during ENL services.  From the data gathered from DRA, NYS ELA and Math  assessments, baseline and midline writing pieces, students' academic strengths and weaknesses in specific reading skills  (phonemic awareness, decoding, fluency, reading comprehension skills etc.), writing skills and math skills are identified.  Data  used to evaluate student progress drives instruction and planning.  Strategies are developed that will support students in the  areas that are deficient.  This data is also used to plan Academic Intervention Services for students.  Response to Interventions  are monitored and shared among service providers regularly to improve student performance.        9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Interactive Math programs, Go Math Academy and VMath, have been implemented to support all students including ELLs and  SWD in acquiring computation fluency and  skills in the four operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division  grades K through 5; Ticket to Read and the AWARD Reading are interactive programs used to address language acquisition  through illustrations, stories and songs for all students including ELLs and SWD. Achieve 3000 is an interactive non-fiction  reading program used by all students grades 3 through 5 including ELLs and SWD. All passages are  leveled according to each  students DRA . Students are assessed twice per school year to measure growth in comprehension and fluency and to change  their level set.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   The programs: academic, physical, artistic and social being used have been successful as demonstrated by student outcomes  and will be continued.  Our school mission to educate the whole child is demonstrated through active engagement in  academics through all modalities using text, technology, out of school learning experiences, physical education experiences  including Mighty Milers, performing arts through chorus, dancing, violin and drama in the classroom.      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All parents, including the parents of ELLs, receive notification and offering for their children to participate in all school  programs. These notifications and invitations are in various languages to accommodate the language needs of our parents.  All  students, including ELLs, participate in academic programs, physical education programs and performing arts programs as part  of our school curriculum, during the school day and in supplemental activities related to the school curriculum and extra-  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66      curriculum.  As part of the school curriculum to support our integrated units of study, all students, including ELLs, participate in  school trips.  These trips are valuable primary source learning experiences from which all students (including ELLs) benefit  greatly.  Attendance records for extra-curricular activities evidence ELL student and parental participation in these programs.  b.  We offer a Saturday Academy Program for ELLs taught by ENL certified teachers partially funded by Title III.  Morning  Programs for ELLs are funded through Title l and Contract for Excellence funds.  However, we are a Conceptually Consolidated  Funded school.       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Classrooms are equipped with SMART boards, and all students (Grades K-5) use technology as an integration tool in all content  areas. All classrooms are equipped with a visual presenter (the ELMO) to support instruction and student learning and  achievement.  Scaffold-leveled trade books, classroom libraries, Junior Great Books, cassette tapes and videos are available  school-wide, grades K through 5.  Students in grades 3 through 5 have access to the Achieve3000 Reading program.  In  addition, the school purchased licenses (grades K through 5) to access the Voyager Learning Ticket to Read online reading  program for the entire student body. Licenses were also purchased for teachers representing every grade level for access to  the Reading A-Z website for guided reading materials and assessment resources to support planning, instruction and student  learning.        13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Since P.S. 56 does not have a bilingual or Native Language model of instruction, to support the Native Language of our ELLs, we  offer a Hispanic Language and Culture Club and a Bengali Language and Culture Club to give our ELLs the opportunity to  celebrate and appreciate their own language in all modalities, in addition to appreciating their own cultural heritage.  Our  Bilingual Cultural Program culminates the year with a presentation of their learning for a public audience of family and  friends.         14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Yes.  All ELLs are grouped by grade/age and then by proficiency level.  Entering/Emerging get 72 mins/day.  Transitioning and  Expanding get 36 mins/day.  Commanding students receive 30 minutes of instruction three times a week.  All materials and  resources correspond to age-grade level curriculum, including science and social studies content.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Classrooms are equipped with SMART boards, and all students (Grades K-5) use technology as an integration tool in all content  areas. All classrooms are equipped with a visual presenter (the ELMO) to support instruction and student learning and  achievement.  Scaffold-leveled tradebooks, classroom libraries, Junior Great Books, cassette tapes and videos are available  school-wide, grades K through 5.  Students in grades 3 through 5 have access to the Achieve3000 Reading program.  In  addition, the school purchased licenses (grades K through 5) to access the Voyager Learning Ticket to Read online reading  program for the entire student body. Licenses were also purchased for teachers representing every grade level for access to  the Reading A-Z website for guided reading materials and assessment resources to support planning, instruction and student  learning.        16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   P.S. 56 offers a summer program during the month of July which includes classes for our ELLs with instruction by our ENL  teacher.

(Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?   1.  All staff, including our principal, assistant principal, parent coordinator, and school secretaries participate in professional  development which supports the needs of all students, including ELLs.  Teachers continue to deepen and strengthen their  ability to analyze student data to differentiate instruction and maximize student learning and student  achievement.  Secretaries attend workshops provided by the FSC and Central to ensure proper processing.  Our schoolwide  instructional focus this year is strengthen critical thinking while refining reading and writing.  The Professional Learning  Calendar of dates for the 2016-2017 school year includes each Monday that school is in session from 2:40 PM to 4:00 PM.  The  schedule is in cycles of four to six weeks (from September 11, 2017 through June 25, 2018).  Each cycle length is based on  depth of study required and appropriately addresses instruction for all students including ELLs, SWD and those capable of  being challenged to a higher level.  Topics of professional learning include but are not limited to: Looking at student formative  data together; Reading and implementing IEPs;  Item Analysis of NYS summative assessment data;  Comparing formative and  summative data to plan for instruction; Using Google Docs to compile ongoing student interventions and next steps and their  providers; Shared Inquiry and oral language development through Junior Great Books, EngageNY Modules, and Readers  Theater; Using Making Thinking Visible Routines to develop student critical thinking and communication skills; and PS 56 held  two full day professional development training sessions (September 6th and November 8th, 2016) for all staff on our revised  units of study in ELA and Mathematics, aligned with Social Studies and Science, to support all students (including ELLs) in  reading, writing, listening and speaking.  Teachers and staff participate in ongoing professional development (Achieve3000  Reading Program) provided by contracted agents to improve teachers' proficiency using technology and to maximize effective  implementation of all technology and interactive Internet programs used to enhance and support all students' (including ELLs)  learning (i.e. improved reading comprehension).          Through all professional learning we are addressing student engagement, higher level critical thinking and discussion skills.  Through all professional learning in the content areas, the teaching of content rich vocabulary is addressed. All teachers,  including teachers of ELLs, participate in professional learning on the three full chancellors' professional development days, as  well as common planning time each week to discuss development of integrated units of study aligned with the common  core.  All teachers of ELLs who also participate in supplemental programs, such as Saturday Academy and ELL Breakfast Club,  receive professional development to support implementation of instruction.               2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Maureen O’Neill, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PS 56 Norwood Heights School                                                                              School DBN: 10X056  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

Home Language Surveys are the first source of information about each parent’s predominant language. That  information is entered into ATS. In addition, our Emergency Cards (Blue Cards) completed at time of student  registration indicate parents’ preferred languages which are entered into ATS. We access ATS periodically to  attain print-outs of languages spoken at home. This supports our efforts to accommodate our parents in their  preferred home language.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community.
