The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7     In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           8       NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           10      Section 4: SCEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The mission of the Eagle Academy for Young Men is to develop young men committed to the pursuit of academic  excellence, strong character and responsible leadership.         2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Overview   The Eagle Academy for Young Men of Harlem is currently completing its fifth year of operation and continues to serve  as the only all male public school in Manhattan. We currently serve 330 young men in grades six through ten and will  expand to a full 6-12 school by 2020. The Eagle Academy empowers at-risk inner city young men to realize their  academic and civic potential with quality immersive learning experiences and proven community based practices that  address short falls in public education.      This year we have partnered with Sheltering Arms, Fordham University, Street Squash, the Harlem YMCA, JP Morgan  Chase, Harlem Hospital, Harlem United, the Fighting Cobras, Harlem Grown, Brotherhood/Sistersol, HEAF, SEO, AIM  High and College Now to provide our young men with opportunities that develop them not only academically, socially  and emotionally.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Our school's special populations range from grades 6-10. They are inclusive of SWDs, who have classifications of  learning disability and ED, and ELLs who range from entering to commanding. In addition to having access to the  general education curriculum and their grade-level general education and non-ELL peers, their needs include  addressing foundational skills gaps and social-emotional challenges.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Framework elements of celebration   1. Supportive Environment: Our school community prides itself on creating a school culture where students feel safe,  supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. This has been acknowledged by other schools, visitors, and in  our School Quality Review.   2. Collaborative Teachers: The teachers of the Eagle Academy for Young Men of Harlem continuously push their  thinking to answer questions such as “how could I of have done that better?” or “what tools do I need to be a more  effective teacher?” Teachers seek professional development based on conversations with each other and with the  support of the administrative team. This staff consistently works towards continuous improvement.   Framework elements of focus   3. Rigorous Instruction: We are continuing our focus on moving all of our classrooms to engaging, discussion rich  centers of learning. While we see pockets of our work being executed being executed in some classrooms, it is not  across all classrooms. Our subject area of focus is in Math.

Strengths- Based on th 2016-2017 Quality Review, schools leaders consistently communicate high expectations to staff  through professional development and 2x2 feedback conversations. Staff and schools leaders communicate high  expectations to families through weekly phone calls and our online grading system. Across some classrooms, students  are demonstrating high order thinking skills, however, teaching strategies are not providing use of multiple entry points  for all learners. School leaders and educators ensure curricula are aligned to Common Core Learning Standards through  units and lesson plans. The school has established a school wide investment in the instructional vision by providing  professional learning around relevance, accessibility and products.       Some of our needs are as follows:      Improve on the modifications and accommodations we make to ensure access for all (Students with Disabilities  (SWDs), English as a New Language (ENL), and students with varied learning styles/needs).     We need to address the foundational skills gaps in ELA and Math which may interfere with grade level mastery.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           15        We need to provide ongoing self-assessment and reflective protocols and opportunities for scholars to   demonstrate ownership of their learning across the classrooms through feedback and conferencing.     Teacher teams must dedicate time to analyzing evidence of student learning to assist in short and long term      curriculum and lesson planning and to provide actionable feedback to students.   Support teachers with curriculum mapping and lesson design to improve educator knowledge of content, skills,  strategies and habits demonstrated through instructional practices.

Strengths:   “The majority of teachers are engaged in structured collaborations to support school goals and implementation of  Common Core Learning Standards. Through team meetings, teachers’ instructional capacity is fortified and teachers  have voice in the decisions that impact students learning across the school. Many shared that teacher teams are  listened to by the administration, and that school leadership follows through on ideas and suggestions. As a learning  community they feel supported and involved in school decisions. Teachers shared that grade team leaders are a key  support, and the principal is open to their opinions and feedback.” (QR indicator 4.2)   Through cohesive grade/department team meetings meet weekly.

Participate in internal and external Inter-visitation cycles.   3. Exchange best practices through lesson study   4. Opportunities to meet with their department teams to set goals and utilize assessment data as the foundation for our  work in collaboratively planning, implementing, and reflecting on our lessons.      Based on our needs assessment, it was determined that the collaborative efforts of our teachers on studying and  implementing best practices in department teams is an area of focus for next year. We will study pedagogical practices  and student outcomes via Lesson Study and looking at student work protocols. We have selected this as a goal so that  we can continue to improve our instructional strategies to increase student academic achievement.      Teachers will go through a process of collecting and analyzing student work artifacts, which will provide feedback to  teachers and inform their decisions around daily instruction and allow them to provide actionable feedback to students  to support their growth. This will also help teachers identify strategies for scholars in need of significant academic  interventions in literacy and math skills.

Staff members have been  assigned to building community partnerships.   Needs: As our school community grows and becomes more diverse, we will need to:     Provide documents translated into languages which reflect the preferred languages of communication of our   parent population     Workshops, which support parents in life skills as well as their evolving adolescents in their academic and social-  emotional needs.     Assign staff members to build community partnerships to expand our partnerships in the arts.    Expand on the parent activities and opportunities for parents to volunteer and to engage as partners in school   wide events        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.     A few strategies which we use for recruitment include partnering with New York City Teaching Collaborative and  Teach for America, attending NYC hiring fairs, using the NYCDOE Open Market, and recommendations from current  staff members. Our school website also serves as a resource for potential candidates to learn about our school  community and vacancies. We have a hiring committee who reviews resumes and makes recommendations for  candidates for round I interviews. During Round I interviews, candidates take a tour of the school, meet with current  staff members, conduct a demonstration lesson, and are interviewed by the committee. Round II candidates return  for a second interview with the Principal.   We have 93% teacher retention this year. Eagle Administration provides the social-emotional support necessary to  allow our educators to provide the academic rigor necessary for our scholars to achieve. Our school social worker  provides cycles of social-emotional professional development for staff which provides a safe, supportive, collaborative  community. Instructional and non-instructional staff have equity of voice through participating in a needs assessment  to help to develop the social emotional professional development calendar. Each week, at our all-staff meetings, we  acknowledge each others' accomplishments, big and small, both professional and personal. In the form of Eagle Ups,  shout outs, and "For the Good of Eagle." Instructional and non-instructional staff have equity of voice through  participating in a needs assessment to help to develop the social emotional professional development calendar.   Professional support is assessed through a mid-year 2x2 feedback process by which all staff have an opportunity to  provide feedback to and to receive feedback from administration, using respective rubrics (Danielson and the  Leadership Competencies) to discuss glows and grows as well as to develop an action plan for supports for the  remainder of the academic year and are including in end of year summative or reflective discussions for assignments  for the following academic year.        2b.

Two schoolwide assessments in ELA, Math and Science  are given periodically each year. High School scholars receive mock midterms, finals and mock regents exams  throughout the course of the academic year.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.           2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           41     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           42           Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           43      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. The Eagle Academy for Young Men, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title  I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.       Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   The Eagle Academy for Young Men of Harlem will support parents and families of Title I students by:   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           44      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           45      ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Elementary and Secondary- Act;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.         School-Parent Compact (SPC)   The Eagle Academy for Young Men of Harlem, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of  student achievement between the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and  programs funded by Title I, agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           46      share responsibility for improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be  developed to ensure that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

This data informs  the ELL educator as well as the others, the ELLs reading ability in T2, which assists the educators in the planning and delivery of  a lesson by allowing it to be in the ELLs' zone of proximal academic/second languge development. For the upper classmen  (grades 7 & 8) the educators will study the data provided by teacher-made assessments, in-class observations, and statewide       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           51      assessments to be able to tailor their instruction.          2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?        3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  At Eagle we evaluate the success of our programs for ELLs by observing how our ELL population advances from one second  language level to the next; this data which is obtained by the NYSESLAT results. Also, on a daily basis we evaluate the success  of our academic programs by the ELLs successful performances on in-class academic activities, formal/informal assessments,  and moving a level higher in their ELA and Math state assessments.         4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?         5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Unfortunately, we have not been able to establish a pattern between the NYSETILL  (New York State English Identification Test  for English Language Learners)and the NYSESLAT (New Yorl State English as a Second LAnguage Achievement Test) because in  the cademic year 2014-2015 we did not receive new students who according the the Home Language Survey (HLIS) would  qualify to have the ENL diagnostic assessment, NYSETILL to adminster. Furthermore, reflecting on the information collected in  the students; cummulative records it can be stated that the previous data results encompassing both assessments determined  that there was a strong correlation between the students being at an advanced level in the acquisition of English as a second  language; therefore, having above average grades across all academic subjects.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?               Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Freestanding English as a new language (ENL) programs provide instruction in English with home language support,   emphasizing English language acquisition. Students in freestanding ENL programs can come from many different   language backgrounds, and English may be the only common language among the students. As per CR Part   154, there are 2 types of ENL:          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           52         • Stand-alone ENL is instruction to develop English language skills so that students can  succeed in core content courses. It is delivered by a certified ENL teacher. A student  may not receive stand-alone ENL in lieu of core content area instruction.     • Integrated ENL is instruction to build English language skills through content area  instruction. It is delivered by a dually certified teacher (ENL and a content area) or coteaching  by a certified ENL teacher and a certified content area teacher (i.e., English  language arts, math, science, or social studies). Both methods of integrated ENL  instruction include content area subject matter and English language development using  ENL strategies. All ELLs and former ELLs up to 2 years after exiting ELL status must  receive a minimum number of units of integrated ENL.       b.  TBE program.  If applicable.                  c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?                                 At the secondary level, ENL is often departmentalized; however, at Eagle Harlem, ENL is delivered inthe  following 3 ways:     Push-in model: an ENL teacher works with ELLs in collaboration with general education classroom teachers to provide  language acquisition and vocabulary support. There is a common preparation time between the 2 teachers and/or prior  collaborative lesson planning.     Pull-out model: ELLs who spend the majority of their day in all-English content instruction are brought together from various  classes for English-acquisition-focused instruction. ENL teachers need to plan carefully with general education teachers to  ensure curricular alignment and continuity of instruction.     Self-contained model: ELLs are grouped together in an ENL class, usually for the entire school day and for all content  instruction  ging  As part of the CR Part 154 ENL Units of  Study:     Entering 3 units of study per week (540 mins), Emerging  2 units of study per week (540 mins), Transitioning 1 unit of study per  week (180 mins), Expanding  1 unit of study per week, Commanding former ELLs continue to receive services for an additional  two years**     STAND-ALONE ENL  Entering 1unit of study in ENL (180 MINS) Emergent         3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.                   The language used to deliver instruction across all academic subjects is English. The educators at Eagle used different  ENL methods and/or approaches to scaffold the content in their classes to be able to assist the ELLs in meeting the daily       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           53      objectives. Some of these approaches and methods are the use of graphic organizers, summary of cnotent and or readings,  related readings with simpler wording, translations in writing or verbally, pethora of visuals aid the ELLs in making the visula  connection, listening of storues told orally (recordings), repatition, and the use of shorter and simpler grammar sentences  when lecturing.          4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?                   ALL teacher-made assessments are in English; however, when addressing the needs of those students in the Entering  and Emerging levels if we do not have anyone on staff that can translate the assesment, the school will contact the office of  translations to assist the particular ELL(s) with oral or written translations.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status       SIFE     Based on the results of the SIFE oral interview with student and the family and after providing the student with a literacy  dioagnostic, preferrably in the students L1 or in a language he feels comfortable, the educator will tailor the instruction to the  student's Zone of Proximal Development using a myriad of images and different types of listening followed by oral   exercises with little to no writing, at first.     Newcomer     After orally interviewing the child and assessing him with the NYSETILL, based on the results of the assessment the   educator will proceed to tailor instruction to fit the student's  both, academic ans social langiage skills through games,   scaffold work using word and sentence starters, cloze activities, and the use of visual assistance at ll times.     Developing     ELLs at the stage of developing which are the students at the Transitioning and Expanding levels will receive instruction that   is less scaffold with lesser images and fewer sentence starters. Independent reading will be fostered and group   collaboration where they are asking and answering questions in T2 will be a bulk of their class evaluation.     Long Term ELLs     The focus of instruction for this population is to achieve academic and language independency not only in the ENL classroom,  but  in all other subject areas. In the ENL classes, particularly, the focus will be in fine tunning skills like reading with purpose,  scanning  the reading to answer multiple choice questions, re-instating the question in a declarative sentence to answer questions,  writing   paragraphs and essays using graphic organizers, and finally being accountable for accurately speaking in T2, thus using   proper grammar.             2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           54      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?      For the ENL class, we are using the following materials: Continental's New York ELLs, gETTING ready for the NYSESLAT and  other supplementary materials to assist students in achieving expanding and commanding through all four language modalities  in   T2.   Humanities Grades 6/7/8 Expeditionary Learning Series  Math 6/7/8 CMP3 Curriculum     Strategies:  Interactive lessons with hands-on  activities and cooperative learning,  • Encouragement of creativity and  discovery,  • Versatility and flexibility,  • Enhancement and support of the  mainstream curriculum,  • Opportunities for all students to  feel successful, Accommodation of the needs of  students at different levels of  ability, and  • Integration of language skills,  thinking skills, and content  knowledge                 7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?     At present we do not have ELLs with an IEP; however, we ensure that the IEP goals are met in conjunction to providing  the language modifications to support both language and academic instruction to be able to make instruction more  comprehensible.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Our targeted intervention services consist of pulling out students for one-to-one or small group instruction with the Special Ed  Educator, mini lessons of required skills to master class content, scaffolding of class work, use of realia and or visuals to  enhance and facilitate instruction, use of graphic organizer that are displayed in the classroom to be used as reference, and the  after school  program which gives the students an aopportunity to receive more explicit instruction.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?       The partnering with the organization Sheltering Arms to be able to continue building students academic concepts and assist  them in explorating their artistic side by learning how to play a musical instrument, paint, and dance.          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           55         10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   No services or programs will be discontinued for the ELLs.       11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  The ELLs are guaranteed full participation to all programs available as they are NOT excluded from any program during or after  school. The ELLs are informed of all of the programs which they can benefit from by verbal announcements, phone calls home,  house mailings and emails. The afterschool program is comprised of certain times of it with academic support and the other  days is devoted to partnering with the organization Sheltering Arms to provide social and artistic support and/or outlet to our  boys.         12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  English Grammar Word builder, ESL Short Stories, Kids Vocab by Mind Snack, EF high flyers, and Word Generation     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Home language support is delivered according to what was stated in the HLIS. Also, the ENL educator translates letters or  speaks in student's L1 (Spanish and some French)        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Being that at present, our ENL population is comprised of very few students (10 including current and former ELLs) it has been  feasible for the ENL educator to ensure that the ELLs required services and resource supports are being provided.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    English Grammar Word builder, ESL Short Stories, Kids Vocab by Mind Snack, EF high flyers, and Word Generation     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   At Eagle Harlem, we have the Summer Bridge program, which allows them to learn the structures, culture, and staff of the  school prior to starting the school year. This program takes place in the summer.       17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    The only language elective that ELLs receive at Eagle is Latin.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A           2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           56      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The ENL Coordinator/Educator provides PDs for the instructional staff when meeting in grade levels or departments. Also, we  have educators from the Eagle foundation who come to the school and offer ENL PDs. The school administrative team, also  priovides PDs which addresses effective ENL strategies.      Calendar of PD dates for current school year  1. September 2015: Special Populations  2. November: In the know...understanding our ELL's from a Data Perspective  3.

Description of workshops for staff (paraprofessionals & secretaries) workshops to support ENL educators to align their  instruction to the Common Core     1. September 2015: Special Populations     Description: This PD will provide staff with an overview of how special populations are determined, who makes up our special  populations at Eagle and how we are begin to support them and their families.     2. November: In the know...understanding our scholars from a Data Perspective     Description: This PD will have staff engaged in looking at baseline data to create supports for ELL and Special Education  scholars.     3. January: Vocabulary Strategies for all: Examining effective strategies for teaching and developing vocabulary for all groups.     Description: This PD will focus on specific strategies for supporting ELLs with vocabulary.       4. March: Math Strategies for all: Examining effective strategies for teaching and developing math conceptual understanding  for all groups.       Description: This PD will focus on showing staff specific strategies for support ELL's in building math concept understanding.       Professional development offered to Eagle teachers of ELLs that is aligned to the CCLS: Sheltered Instruction Lesson  Preparation, utilizing Sheltered Instruction, strategies for Teaching Beginning English Language Learners Across the Curriculum,  for vocabulary and phonics for ELL, and read-aloud strategies for ELLs.         2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  First of all we must look at the ENL level of the incoming student; therefore determine the instruction to follow. The ENL  educator will provide the staff with scaffold lessons accompanied with visuals and work tailored to assist the ELL with language  acquisition to be able to have equal access to instruction and thus begin asssiting with the transition from elementary to       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           57         Middle. Also, the ENL educator will follow the incoming student throughout the first few days (including the mandated  minutes for L2 acquisition) to provide one-to-one guidance in L1 and facilitate the process of adapting to middle school.  The  Social Worker will provide   one-to-one or group counseling for the incoming ELLs who are experiencing difficulty adapting to the new school. In these  sessions, the Social Worker will engage the ELLs in social-activities, for example playing table games, writing a free journal, or  simply having the ELL(s) express how they feel in the new school. Finally, the Social Worker will suggests strategies that they  can utilize on their own throughout the period of adaptation.  AT Eagle, we design professional development design to be consistent with the mandates on the CR Part 154. During the week,  the educators are professionally developed on Monday and Friday. Each PD session lasts 2 hours and thirty minutes.  The PDs  offered at Eagle will provide staff with an overview of how special populations, our ELLs and the sub populations are  determined and how we are supporting them and their families.ngaged in looking at baseline data to create supports for ELL  and Special Education scholars.  The PD agendas, sign in sheets, and handouts provided to the staff being developed is  maintained by the administrative team.        Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   The school meets with the ELL parents during Prent Welcome Night, Parent-Teacher Meetings, and ESL Worskshop for Parents.  in thse meetings we provide refreshments and translations, both oral and in writing. The parents are provided with tranlation  services, both in writing and speaking. If a parent speaks a language that is out of the locust of any language other than English  spoken by staff members at the school, the ENL Coordinator contacts the DOE Translation Unit and requests a translator for  the event.   For the ELL families, the ENL Coordinator designates at least two (2) meetings throughout the year in which several  topics are discussed with parents. Some of these topics are: student's academic and language progress, behavior,  program  selection choice, and will model strategies on how to assist their child(ren) with the homework.      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   The Parent Coordinator develops professional development for the Parent body At-Large.  Over the course of the year, the  parent coordinator will host parent workshops that specifically support families of ELL's. The first, which was held by the ENL  Coordinator, focused on providing necessary information and providing a added sense of awareness around how to support  their child in and out of school. Throughout the meetings their wil be a translator from the school or the DOE Translation Unit  to assist them in undertanding what is being discussed and to be able to actively partiicipate by providing them with a voice.             Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Mahaliel Bethea, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.            2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           60                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Eagle Academy for Young Men of                                                                              School DBN: 05/148  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

Yes/No       (*Primary)             * The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs  on translation,   interpretation, compliance and budget.      School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      At the Eagle Academy for Young Men of Harlem we ensure that communication to our families adheres to their  language of preference as they previously stated in part III of their HLIS (Home Language Identification Survey).  During enrollment time, the English as a New Language) ENL Coordinator conducts an oral interview in the English  language unless the family specifies differently. As the interview is being conducted, the ENL Coordinator will be  completing the HLIS in which the parents will be addressing questions regarding the language spoken at home.  Specifically, in part III the interviewer asks questions about the language in which s/he would like to receive  communication in both writing and orally. A second source of information used to ensure parents' language needs  are being addressed is by accessing the ATS report entitled Adult Preferred Language Report (RAPL) which clearly  states the language parents wish to be communicated regarding school functions, news, and events; both orally  and in writing. The Student Emergency Cards is a great source to ensure bfamilies are being communicated with in       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           62      their L1 (Native language) or in a language of preference. Finally, the School Parent Survey is another useful tool  we utilize to continue ensuring that our families are receiving information about the what is taking place in our  school campus.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     Written Preferred    Percent Written          Oral Preferred    Percent Oral          Language    The parents preferred  languages for both written  and oral communication  are: English, Spanish,  Fulani, Haitian Creole,  Portuguese, and French.  Some of our familes who  come from countries, for  example, Senegal speak  Wolof at home, but  insisted on the HLIS to  receive oral or written  communication from the  school in either, French or  English.            3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.            Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services    1.
