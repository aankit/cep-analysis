This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   At PS 69X Journey Prep, we strive to create a community of life-long learners who demonstrate grit," and take  academic "risks" in pursuit of excellence. Through the process of inquiry, discovery and exploration, students learn  the necessary skills to be creative, caring, and college and career ready members of society. Through the involvement  of community members, teachers, and parents as partners, we provide a standards-based curriculum that  encompasses the different learning styles of all students. In Educating Minds and Hearts, all learners have a voice in  impacting on our ever-changing global world.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    PS 69 Journey Prep is three building campus which educated approximately 635 students. (79.37% Hispanic/Latino,  15.12% Black, and the remainder roughly 1% of White, Asian and Hawaiian).      54% Male / 46.93% Female    19.69% Special Education    67.24% Economically Disadvantaged    11.97% English Language Learners   Initiatives embedded within School Culture(but not limited to):      Through recognizing the contributions of all members of school community, our school philosophy is to   educate "minds and hearts,"of all constituents. We celebrate the academic achievements and affiliations of  our students and staff. Emphasizing the culture and climate of high expectations, we have implemented a  rigorous curriculum/development process that permeates classroom instruction, teacher teams,  social/emotional development, student centered learning/engagement/activities/programs, the arts, and  family engagement. Our school budget supports and validates this work.   School Professional Learning Environment: The school culture is centered on professional learning that has directly  impacted student performance and progress as demonstrated by multiple data points over time. We value  professional learning, student engagement, the arts, and family engagement, all of which is strongly reflected in the  budget.      Differentiated Professional Development:     Noting common trends and patterns, teachers receive Professional Development learning opportunities on   grade level bands as well as individually within their classrooms. Follow up happens within classrooms in the  forms of modeling, co-teaching, common planning, and “on the spot” coaching. This ensures that Professional  Development is not a “one size fits all,” but differentiated to meet the needs of the diverse adult learner.    The opportunity for teachers to “see” best practices are commonly found at PS 69X as they engage within   inter-visitations, lab-sites, and turn-keying pertinent information to the staff about ways that students learn  best.   Strong Teacher Teams: Grade-level Teacher Teams have a common preparation/planning period every week to meet.  This is in addition to the weekly PLC (Professional Learning Community).     An instructional core team     Teacher teams have been established in multiple areas in the school and are led by teachers.    Clear Expectations and Communication: A clear vision is established for all students and families. All members of our  school community are valued and share in the decision making process. This is reflected in the vision, mission and  culture of our school community. (Various artifacts include: Morning Message, Memos/Emails, Week at a Glance,  Daily Bulletin, Schools Website). The community shares in this vision, which is evidenced in the alignment of work  done by various teams, both vertical and horizontal; common language used by teams, staff, students, and parents  around professional conversations and learning. Our expectations are clear and are explicitly communicated around  our beliefs on how children learn best and what we most value in an education setting. It is our belief that children  learn best through a rigorous process of inquiry, discovery, and exploration.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Arts/Enrichment Activities: Various activities and philosophies allow for the arts to be used as a catalyst for learning.  Some learning activities include:     The Reggio Emilia Inspired Approach to learning - Our NYC Showcase Focus    Renzulli Inspired Enrichment Clusters    Archery  Junior Broadway Style Productions     STEM-tastic Inquiry Group      Paideia Socratic Seminars      Social Emotional Learning: As the "heartbeat" of the school, our social emotional learning philosophy is aimed to  educate the whole child through a variety of strategies to support academic and social needs. They include:     RULER    Peer Mediation Program    Project World Club      Kinder Buddies Program    4Rs    Brain Power   Student Council       Outside Collaborations and Partnerships that the school incorporates are:     RULER (YALE UNIVERSITY)    4Rs (Fordham University)    Brain Power Classroom     Wide World Online (Harvard University)      NYC Mayor's Office for Mental Health    Leake and Watts (Social/Emotional Wellness)      3.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51      each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52        Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS 69X Journey Prep, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of  the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      PS 69X Journey Prep will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students     providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level,   e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology;     providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and      decision making in support of the education of their children;  fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress;     providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;     sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and  in languages that parents can understand;     providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and  other members of the school community; The school’s Parent Involvement      Parental Involvement and School Quality   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:      actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s  Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of  the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;     engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated   directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;     ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and      strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the  Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

Our before school, after school, Winter/Spring Learning Institutes, and Saturday programs  address these specific needs and deficits.   Instructional support is delivered to English Language Learners through a variety of levels (or  Tiers). In addition to best practices that support ELLs by classroom teachers, students also  receive Academic Intervention Services (AIS) by additional support staff during the school day.  AIS providers provide academic intervention using a variety of strategies and research based  interventions such as Fountas and Pinnell, Tune Into Reading, FUNDations, Achieve 3000, and  Read Works as well as En Vision, CAMS, etc.   All instructional and intervention programs target the the following English Language Learner  Subgroups: Necomers, Middle Year ELLs, and Former ELLs.  The ENL Strategies for "Success in School Breakfast Meeting" targets ELL students in grades  three through five. There will be a total number of 32 students with three teachers (as well as an  ENL teacher) supporting the students. (ENL teacher is funded through Title III funds). The focus  is on vocabulary, language development, test taking strategies and understanding the approaches  to problem solving as well as complex reading of varied texts. There is ongoing articulation  between the classroom teacher, ELA and math teacher for an hour on two different mornings.  Both teachers engage students in direct instruction, group work and immersion of language. The  program involves monitoring student progress through on-going assessments targeting  benchmark levels of mastery.  Each student has a personal prescribed action plan with SMART  goals, written by all the professionals who work with the student. Packets go home so that  parents can work with their children. This program, which is delivered in English is offered  January through April: Wednesdays and Thursday at 7:15 until 8:10AM.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  PS 69 uses Fountas and Pinnel for grades kindergarten through 5th for literacy assessment. These results allow us to evaluate  where our ELLs stand in regards to their English-speaking peers as well as charting their own individual progress. The students  are assessed three times during the school year namely at the beginning, middle and end periods. Thus the school is provided  with a benchmark by which we can assess progress as cohorts and individuals as the year goes on. In addition, every 6-8 weeks  students are given a CCLS targeted simulated exam which encompasses a variety of target standards. The data is disagreggated  by subgroup, grade and level of language acquisition. This data helps the early childhood team (as well as the inquiry team) to  capitalize on those areas of strength in determining thematic approaches to reading and to concentrate on the language and  literacy needs of our ELLs. Previous New York State ELA exams are also used to gauge what level the students are at in literacy.  The ESL teacher uses the National Geographic Reach literacy series to regularly assess the ELLs. The teacher follows the  National Geographic Reach Assessment Handbook to assess letter recognition, phonics, reading, writing, comprehension, and  oral skills. This provides the teacher where the students’ strengths and weaknesses lie. The data also demonstrates progress.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69      The teacher uses the data to determine whether re-teaching is necessary or to move onto the next unit. The data can also  determine and change ESL Standalone groups. Grouping is flexible and can change throughout the year as determined by  data.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   * Staggered testing schedule (Assessment schedule)  * Common Planning (for curriculum modifications and coherence)  * Deep Data Dive Clinics (Scheduled Data talks about specific students with targeted action plans)  * Differentiated Professional Learning (based on tiers of support and individual steps)     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Individual and cohort data analysis is used to assess progress and performance on a periodic and annual basis. Scoring out and  advancing in the NYSESLAT and parent support and satisfaction with their child’s growth is paramount in our model. When  looking at the ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT),  the School Leadership Team can see that the students across the grade levels  show consistently advanced scores in listening and speaking. The reading and writing NYSESLAT scores show a slower growth,  but growth as the student moves through the grades nonetheless.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    * Students data is disaggregated to target individual needs  * Use of research based interventions to target specific needs (i.e. REACH, ReadWorks, etc)  * ENL and General Education teachers common plan to address student needs.   * Professional Learning Opportunities to support General Education teachers supporting English Language Learners       5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   PS 69 Journey Prep has an RTI Team that works to provide students with services as needed. The students are evaluated in  both languages. Their strengths and weaknesses in both languages are taken into account. Upon referral to the RTI team, the  student’s baseline data is used to determine strengths and weaknesses. The team develops SMART (Specific, Measurable,  Attainable, Realistic, and Timely) goals for each student. An intervention plan is created using all of this data and the SMART  goals. Once the interventions are in place, weekly data is collected. The data collected is contingent upon the SMART goals and  areas of weakness. Student progress is looked at every 6-8 weeks. The classroom teacher is kept apprised of progress.  Students progress is measured through the cyclical process of Response to Intervention by Examing Classroom Instruction,  Draw on multiple sources of information, Analyze data through lens of acquisition, Design and implement targeted  intervention supports and Monitor progress overtime and plan for midcourse corrections. Following this procedure ensures  that students are attaining what they need by specific interventions.       6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   It is clear from the modality review of the NYSESLAT that the vast majority of our ELLs have a good or advanced command of  English listening and speaking and BICS (Basic Interpersonal Communication Skills). The 2017 NYSESLAT data shows that  students performing at different levels such as 24% Entering, 1% Emerging, 11% Transitioning, 28% Expanding, and 31%  Commanding.  The majority of our ELLs fall into the Expanding and Commanding categories, which suggests a different  approach to instruction. Instruction will emphasize vocabulary development, reading instruction and guided practice in  reading and writing to meet the individual goals of students. The progression in developing their language skills is shown by  the number of students who score out or move from entering to transitional and commanding levels. Across the grades, the  students excel in listening and speaking and need more reinforcement in reading and writing.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70         Review of data is ongoing and scheduled throughout the school year between the Principal and the ENL Team through a  variety of ways:         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Currently we are using a push in and pull out model and a standalone model for different grade groups. In the  standalone model, licensed ENL teachers meet with the students (grades K, 3 - 5) at the beginning and intermediate  levels for 360 minutes per week. These students receive instruction in order to acquire the English language needed  for success in core content courses. Those students at the advanced level are seen for 180 minutes a week in a  standalone setting. In our integrated model, our ENL teacher pushes in to several grade groups such as 1  st,   2  nd   In  this model, our students are receiving core content learning and English language development from a dually certified  teacher and a general education teacher. A standalone group of newcomers is formed to specifically provide  intervention for those that are new to this country. As students gain confidence and progress in their English language  skills we plan to transition them to a push in model. Our goal is to meet the linguistic needs of each individual student  while moving to a complete push in model over the course of the school year. Classroom teachers and ELL specialists  plan together for the instruction of ELL students. Instruction is based on a thematic approach driven by the topics that  are part of the classroom curriculum.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   PS 69 presently has a free standing ENL only program model. Instructional minutes are delivered in standalone/Integrated  model as per the proficiency level of each student. Students in the Entering and Emerging stage of acquisition receive 360  minutes per week, while Transitioning and Expanding receive 180 minutes per week of services. Students in the Commanding  stage of acquisition receives 90 minutes of ENL services.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Content areas are delivered in English in the regular classroom. Classroom teachers are trained in ESL methodology and  routinely apply same to their delivery. In consultation with classroom teachers, ESL teachers review and reinforce content  instruction and use content materials in their language development approach. Various methodology and instructional  approaches are used to engage and teach ELLs. This includes the SIOP model to deliver instruction and also the use of graphic  organizers, realia, scaffolding, comprehensible input, picture dictionaries, additional literature, and accessing prior knowledge.  Literature used in the ESL classroom includes Reach, Rigby: On Our Way to English, and Mondo. Reach is a content based, Core   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71      Curriculum aligned program that is used in order to provide content area instruction. The program uses social studies and  science to teach literacy.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   Students that are deemed entitled to ENL programming after being administered the Home Language and NYSITELL and are  Spanish speaking. If they are Spanish speaking, they are given the Spanish LAB. In addition, translated tests and student  assignments (as well as translators) are made available in the students’ native language for math and science state exams. Oral  interviews are also conducted in the native language at registration.         5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    A) SIFE students are placed into smaller pull out groups in order to meet their needs and provide appropriate intervention.  These students work on text skills including reading, phonics, oral language development, listening and writing. The Rigby, On  Our Way to English series provides Phonics Song Charts that aid students with letter sounds and word families. In the regular  classroom setting, these students are given a buddy that speaks the native language and helps him/her and guides him/her in  everyday classroom tasks. In addition, these students attend Saturday School in order to provide further intervention.  6b) Newcomer students are given additional support in Basic Interpersonal Communication Skills. These skills include speaking  and conversational skills and also lessons in social studies about their new country. This is done in order to ease their  integration into their new school, community, and country. This provides students with the skills necessary to communicate on  a daily basis. The teacher uses the Reach: In the USA reading program that is designed for students newly arrived to the  country. The program covers sight words, basic communication skills, beginning reading strategies. This program prepares the  students to communicate and read in the general education classroom.  6c) ELLs receiving services 4 or more years are enrolled in pre- and post- school groups where they receive additional  language, literacy and math support. In addition, a Saturday Academy program has been instituted for long term ELLs. This  program provides small group instruction for those students that need additional help in ELA and math.  ELL students who  have not met the performance standards in listening receive additional support from the ENL teachers as part of the ENL block  scheduling. This small group of students meet with the teacher for hour long sessions three days a week. The instructional  focus is to teach the students active listening skills that allow them to listen for specific and important information that  depends on the activity at hand. The certified ENL teacher works with the students on active listening skills through read aloud  activities, a listening center with accountable activities, and listening games. During a read aloud, the teacher chooses a grade  and language level appropriate book and reads it to the group. Throughout the reading an ongoing class discussion is going on  in order to check for understanding and for details. The individual follow-up activity also provides for an assessment. The  listening center is used with grade and language level appropriate books along with activities that are used as an assessment  for the teacher to check for listening comprehension. The listening game “I Have, Who Has?” is played once a week in class.  The students must actively listen in order to complete the game successfully. Without listening for information they cannot  successfully participate in the game.  ELL students who have not met proficiency in writing receive additional support throughout the school day. The ENL certified  teacher for 72 minutes, five days a week, services these students. The instructional focus during this time is for the students to  successfully complete a piece of writing as per the rubric for the task. This includes complete sentences, correct punctuation,  grammar and spelling, and clear paragraphs. These students show weakness in writing conventions and also in summary  writing. The students also tend to leave out specific details in their writing pieces. The ENL teacher also works in conjunction  with the classroom teacher to provide support and strategies for these students. Empire State NYSESLAT workbooks help guide  the students with pre-writing, writing essays, using correct syntax and correcting sentences. Every classroom is also equipped  with laptops that have the program WriteToLearn. Pearson’s WriteToLearn has a built in dictionary and has the ability to read  the passage to the student in order to facilitate better understanding for ELL students. The program acts like a personal tutor  for writing and provides instant feedback. The students practice both summary writing and essay writing. The ENL reading  program Reach has a writing component that is very beneficial to the ESL students. Explorations in Nonfiction is used at every   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72      grade level, has established lessons and organizers that are a great resource and companion to the reading series. The graphic  organizers that are part of the program makes writing and conventions accessible and easier to understand for the students  that are struggling. Throughout the day the ENL teachers use different writing strategies learned in ongoing professional  development such as writing prompts and brainstorming with graphic organizers in order to provide ideas. Students have  punctuation charts and interactive word walls in order to provide aid with conventions and word choice. There are also  exemplars for writing assignments in order to establish expectations. The ENL teacher also meets and plans with the classroom  teachers in order to establish an action plan for these students to succeed.  6d) PS 69 currently provides a Saturday Academy and After School activities for Long Term ELLs to receive additional support in  literacy and math. The instructional focus for these programs is for the students to be able to reach grade level proficiency in  literacy and math. The Saturday Academy teachers work together with the certified ENL teacher to formulate an action plan  for each student. The teachers work on reading and writing and math. The focus is on vocabulary, test taking strategies, and  understanding approaches to problem solving. The After School program is taught by the classroom teachers in conjunction  with the ENL teacher and provides intervention for the students that are at risk in math and ELA. Teachers use such books as  Progress Coach: Math, Progress Coach: ELA, Buckle Down: Math, Rise and Shine Math and Rise and Shine ELA. These are used  to fill in the knowledge gaps for those students that need extra support in ELA and math. They reinforce basic skills along with  more complex topics.  6e) Transitional support is delivered during both during the day and After School programs. The students work with the ESL  certified teacher in a small group pull out setting or integrated model in order to provide the students with individualized  attention. Study skills and test prep are emphasized to help these students succeed on the myriad of standardized and content  area tests they need to pass. For the next two years, former ELLs are entitled to receive 90 minutes of ENL services. They are  entitled to receive testing accommodations such as extended time and directions read.          6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Teachers of ELL-SWDs use many different strategies and techniques to ensure that the students have access to academic  content and accelerate their English language development. Teachers employ such strategies such as the use of graphic  organizers, visuals and frequent use of the SmartBoard in order to provide interactive and engaging lessons. High Interest  literature is used to appeal to interest and ability. These materials are used for specific subgroups such as ELLs, SWDs and  native language speakers. In addition, multiple intervention programs are available to support the needs of students who may  have been affected. Programs such as FUNDations, Fountas and Pinnell Reading Intervention, Read Works, Waterford and  Wilson. This program allows for interactive, student centered lessons in ELA and math. Some technological programs that  support the needs include Reading A-Z where students monitor their own progress while working independently. In addition,  Tune Into Reading ensures that students receive practice in fluency and comprehension.      PS 69 works towards placing ELL-SWDs in the least restrictive environment according to his/her needs. Continuous articulation  of ENL teacher and special education teacher ensure that students receive quality instruction in terms of their IEPs. Ongoing  conversation ensures that students are receiving appropriate programming to support their learning. The staff works together  to decide on the best placement for these students. If the student receives related services such as OT/PT, speech and  language or SETSS, the teachers work together to create a schedule that allows for the student to adequately receive all  services and be in class during necessary lessons. These teachers work and plan together in order to service the student’s  needs in English language development.         7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Scheduling student services is at the core of student success. Ensuring that students receive all the services they are entitled,  the school has no option but to be flexible in terms of scheduling. Integrated and Standalone are scheduled so that way the  least Intervention programs for ELLs are offered in English, and Spanish where possible. These programs have adapted  materials in a small group setting with access to the core curriculum. They include services delivered by the SETSS and the  Morning Breakfast Club, After School Sessions and Saturday Academy. Content area intervention is targeted to the upper  grades at all language levels. Criteria used to place ELL-SWDs in ICT classes are students who are within Expanding or  Commanding level of Acquisition. The ELLs from the first subgroup of 0-3 years of service, are given an instructional focus of   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73      literacy in order to provide the students with the phonics skills necessary to catch up to their English speaking pears. The Rigby,  On Our Way to English phonics component is a great resource for these students. ELLs with 4-6 years of service and long term  ELLs have an intense instructional focus on academic writing. These students are worked with on writing conventions and  clearly conveying ideas through the use of graphic organizers, modeling, and mini-lessons.        8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  As of last year, Journey Prep has begun a new literacy program for ELL students. The National Geographic Reach program is  being used for the ENL pull out program. This program teaches English through the content areas. Each unit has either a social  studies or science focus with language and literacy goals that complement the area of study. This program has pushed our  students to use more academic vocabulary and more accountable talk. We feel that this program is effective as shown through  analysis of authentic student work classroom data. The analysis shows all students made progress and reached proficeny and  mastery on teacher designed rubrics aligned to CCLS.      Programs such as FUNDations, Fountas and Pinnell Reading Intervention, Read Works, Waterford and Wilson. This program  allows for interactive, student centered lessons in ELA and math. Some technological programs that support the needs include  Reading A-Z where studenst monitor their own progress while working independently. In addition, Tune Into Reading ensures  that students receive practice in fluency and comprehension.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Introducing technology programs to support ELLs will be utilized into the instructional core. The programs Tune Into Reading  and Reading A-Z and RAZ Kids will be used to supplement ELL learning in literacy as both an independent and guided activity.  This year, "An Article a Day" will be introduced to help support content knowledge of students and build their prior  knowledge.  All ELLs participate in all school programs. These include but are not limited to, After School Clubs, Special  Assemblies and School Trips. In addition ELLs join the Breakfast Club, the After School Program and Saturday Academy for  language and literacy development. ELLs are also encouraged to run for and participate in Student Council. On Friday  afternoons, all ELLs also participate in Enrichment Clusters in the spring. Chorus and archery are also made available to all  students, including ELLs.          10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   No programs will be discontinued due to their success.      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All students receive services to help them achieve academic success. These include but are not limited to, After School Clubs,  Special Assemblies and School Trips. In addition ELLs join the Breakfast Club, the After School Program and Saturday Academy  for language and literacy development. ELLs are also encouraged to run for and participate in Student Council. On Friday  afternoons, all ELLs also participate in Enrichment Clusters in the spring. Chorus and archery are also made available to all  students, including ELLs. These programs have supported the learning of ELLs and helped them success.                12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Introducing technology programs to support ELLs will be utilized into the instructional core. The programs Tune Into Reading  and Reading A-Z and RAZ Kids will be used to supplement ELL learning in literacy as both an independent and guided activity.  This year, "An Article a Day" will be introduced to help support content knowledge of students and build their prior knowledge.  In content classes, students have access to exams in their native language and native language dictionaries and glossaries. The  Envision math program used by the classroom teachers, has portions of each unit available in Spanish. Teachers with  newcomer students make use of this part of the program.         13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74         The home language support is delivered through appropriate resources and materials to support ENL learners. Some include  translating  articles, providing quality literature, visual, hands on, manipulatives, graphic organizers and kinesthetic materials.  In addition, differentiated techniques and multiple entry points such as grouping, pairs to scaffold the learning experience.        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    The ENL teacher and administration continue to review students receiving services. This is done through ongoing articulation  between all those supporting the ELLs. Students are placed in grade levels based on their age and receive the scaffolded  support to ensure entry points to grade level standard based work.  Students social emotional wellbeings are taken into  considerations so that developmental and cognitive abilities are addressed.        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Introducing technology programs to support ELLs will be utilized into the instructional core. The programs Tune Into Reading  and Reading A-Z and RAZ Kids will be used to supplement ELL learning in literacy as both an independent and guided activity.  This year, "An Article a Day" will be introduced to help support content knowledge of students and build their prior knowledge.  In content classes, students have access to exams in their native language and native language dictionaries and glossaries. The  Envision math program used by the classroom teachers, has portions of each unit available in Spanish. Teachers with  newcomer students make use of this part of the program.         16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   We provide newly enrolled ELLs with the opportunity to meet the teacher, principal and aspects of the school environment.  This orientation includes the Parent Coordinator, Krystal Hamilton, Assistant Principal Walter Galiano, ENL provider, Eunice  Padilla, Bilingual Guidance Counselor, Claribel Gonzalez. For those who enroll throughout the school year are also offered a  peer mentor/mediator program which allows for easy transition and ongoing support.  Agendas and sign ins are maintained  and held in Main Office.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    None      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?                  Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  1) All ESL certified teachers attend regular meetings with District 08 and Bronx Borough Field Office to support ENL  instruction.  These meetings review policy, best practices and data analysis. These teachers also regularly attend professional  development meetings offered through the Department of Education. The methods, techniques, current trends and research  acquired there are then incorporated into school wide training for the entire staff, as everyone interfaces with ELLs on some  level. There is school wide ESL training provided to the staff on a monthly basis delivered by the state certified ESL coordinator.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          75         This training can cover a range of topics up to and including vocabulary development, ESL reading and writing, scaffolding for  ELLs, stages of oral language development and linguistic diversity. In addition, the ESL teacher reaches out to outside agencies  to gain ENL knowledge and innovative educational practices.    2) The ESL teacher attends ongoing meetings at the district level. All information presented in these workshops is turn-keyed  to the staff including the guidance counselors and include such topics as the Common Core and ESL and the ESL Student in the  General Education Classroom. Staff learn how to adjust their teaching to meet all students in their class. Some activities  include using assessment, measuring progress, and developing lessons that allow for multiple entry points of English Language  Learners. We have a bilingual guidance counselor on staff that works with the ESL students upon entry. She helps them learn  the routines of the school and discusses their new environment. She is in close contact with the classroom and ESL teacher.  The ESL teacher works with teacher teams on a weekly basis. The teams work together to align the curriculum to the Common  Core. The ESL teacher makes recommendations on accommodations for the English language learners. Performance tasks for  every unit are aligned to the Common Core and accommodations are made for English language learners at every level.  Classroom teachers gain a deeper understanding of what is expected from a student at any language level.      2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  3)The teachers of our upper grades (4th and 5th) visit the middle schools that we feed. There they meet with the 6th grade  teachers and administration to discuss the incoming students and how they can collaborate to ease the children’s’ transition to  middle school. Some activities they participate in include making decisions, being accountable and preparing for the unknown  in middle level. Our Guidance Counselors create activities and discussions targeting how to ease the transition between the  developmental difference of elementary and middle school. In the spring semester, 5th grade students visit the middle schools  that we feed.  4) Certified ELL and special education teachers who have previously been trained, provide workshops on school half-days and  staff development days to the entire staff. At the beginning of the year the ESL teacher meets with the classroom teachers of  the ELL students to provide an orientation in order to familiarize the staff with ESL methodology, scheduling, assessment and  testing procedures. The staff also attends monthly staff development meetings. The ESL teacher speaks about best practices  during these meetings. Some of the topics covered include linguistic diversity, stages of ELL development, BICS and CALP,  literacy for ELLs, scaffolding, ELL writing, academic vocabulary development, and best practices. Teachers learn how to meet  the needs of their ELL students through strategies presented in these meetings. The teachers also view videos and model  lessons in order to view how these practices and strategies are presented to the students. Recently, a workshop on  SIOP(Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol) and how this protocol can help our ELL students. Specifically, teachers were  introduced to language objectives and practiced writing them for their own lessons. These workshops meet at least the  minimum 7.5 hours of training as mandated by the Jose P. legislation. There is also a meeting before the NYSESLAT is  administered in order to familiarize the classroom teachers with the purpose and format of the test. There are attendance  sheets at each of these meetings in order to keep track of the mandated hours.             Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?     1) In addition to the strong parent involvement activities that PS 69 offers, the school provides individual meetings to discuss  goals of program, language development, progress, etc. These meetings occur at least once a year and all are invited to attend.  Parents of ELLs also receive support in other activities that PS 69 offers.  PS 69 has a strong PTA. Our meetings are heavily  attended and they are conducted in both English and Spanish so that our ELL parents are comfortable and kept informed and  involved in their children’s education. Translation services are always made available. Every month, the principal conducts a  meeting titled “Book and a Bagel.” In this meeting the principal and parents discuss the book of the month that is read by   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          76            every class in the school. Translators are always provided. On the last Friday of the month, the principal meets with the  parents in an informal setting entitled “Coffee Talk.” There is also a fall and a spring meeting for ELL parents to discuss the  expectations of ELLs, promotional criteria, and the NYSESLAT and other state assessments, among other topics. Journey Prep  has meetings monthly on how parents can help their students learn and grow using the Common Core Standards, titled  "Understanding the Common Core." Parents learn how the new standards effect their child’s learning and how they can help  their child at home.  In addition to the Common Core meetings, there are monthly meetings relating to academics at Journey  Prep. An evening session of this same program will be offered in the future. The fourth Tuesday of every month has a  workshop relating to the Common Core. They cover topics such as early childhood math, grades 3-5 math, early childhood ELA  and grades 3-5 ELA.      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  PS 69 offers a variety of partnerships with parents. Workshops are offered to all and they are offered in translation as well. The  Parent Cordinator along with a team plan the workshops for parents. Members of that team include the ESL teacher,  administration and parents. Some activities inlcude PS 69 Journey Prep partners with FoodBank to deliver CookShop.  CookShop provides parents with cooking classes and monthly grocery distribution. The parents learn how to cook and shop for  nutritional foods. Inaddition, fan 4 Kids partners with PS 69 to deliver healthy habits such as exercise and fitness for the  community. Other academic workshops target CCLS and learning in school. The organizations that partner with PS 69 include  National Teaching Network, NY Historical Society, LeAp and Literacy Supports.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Sheila Durant, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          78                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PS 069X Journey Prep                                                                              School DBN: 08X069  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      In order to provide access to appropriate language of our school community, we use a variety of ways to collect  information regarding written and oral communication. Using pertinent information such as:   1.  Based on the Home Language Identification Survey, a record of adult preferred languages for written  translation and oral interpretation are maintained in ATS (based on the results of the Home Language  Identification Survey (HLIS): Our predominate language is Spanish. (As per reports: RPOB and RDGS)   2.  Formal parent surveys are distributed in September and January of each school year.  3.  Emergency Cards are translated in both languages to get more information.   4.  Language Proficiency Team (LP Team) interview child and parents to determine home language codes    After the collection of this data, it isis shared with our school staff (including Guidance Counselor, Parent  Coordinator, Related Service Providers) and then all communication (whether oral or written) is translated  through a variety of ways:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          80   1.  All written correspondence between the school and students' families is provided in both Spanish and   English (and some Arab). As a result, we use Google Translate which is then reviewed for accuracy by our  ELL Teacher, prior to dissemination to parents. This includes information such as:  o  Letters of Concern about student's academic performance and behavior.  o  Welcome packets and orientations for families, Parent Handbooks, permission slips and facts and   information pertaining to school policy.    o  General parent letters  o  Emergency Cards    2.  All oral correspondence between the school and students' families is translated by both ENL providers as   well as bilingual staff members (i.e. Guidance Counselor, Psychologist, Teachers, etc.) In addition,  translation services are provided to parents through the "Over the Phone Interpreter Services" both in  school or in their home. This includes (but not limited) to events such as:   o  Parent meetings (Parent Association)  o  Special Events (Concerts, assemblies, etc.)  o  Curriculum Nights   o  Homework Diner  o  Parent Engagement Tuesdays (Weekly)                    2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community.
