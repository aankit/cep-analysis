This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   To empower every scholar, every day through culturally relevant and engaging instruction with supports for the  whole child.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Frederick Douglass Academy III, has partnered with Center for Supportive Schools (C.S.S.) to become a Community  School. This designation has brought additional funding, resources, and expertise through the organization and full- time Community School Director. Frederick Douglass Academy III (412 students SY 17-18 in grades 9-12), is built on Dr.  Lorraine Monroe’s vision of academic and personal excellence for all scholars.   The school population comprises 45% Black, 51% Hispanic, and 2% White students, a large majority of which will be  the first generation in their family to attend college. The student body includes 12% English language learners and  21% special education students. Boys account for 52% of the students enrolled and girls account for 48%. Through  immersion in our Core Values – Respect, Education, Professionalism and Community Awareness – scholars evolve as  they matriculate at Frederick Douglass Academy III. Our warm supportive environment fosters the growth and  development that our youngsters need.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   During the 2017 - 2018 school year, our ENL population continued to grow. We received approximately 15 non-native  English speakers who were new to the country. These scholars necessitated additional ENL services in order to be  supported in academic achievement. We hired an additional ENL teacher and provided supports through a pilot  Transitional Bilingual Education program. This also led to us beginning to test our scholars on the ELA exam in 10th  grade.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   This past year, our school made the most progress in creating and maintaining a Supportive Environment. The school  prides itself on the creation of its Core Values, Branding, and the creation of scholar incentives such as school trips.  The school celebrates students frequently with attendance celebrations, academic honors, and other college/career  experiences such as our first College Readiness Day. Additionally, we continued our tradition of a school-wide Career  Day and Community Service Day. We have developed many strategic partnerships that help us meet our mission,  including Kinvolved, Spark House, Bronxworks, PGC, College Now, Opening Act, New York City Men Teach, NYU  College Tutor Corps, Algebra for All, LINCT, and Expanded Success Initiative (ESI).      This past school year, we emphasized College and Career Readiness and Rigorous Instruction through our Interim  Assessment Program, we continued to build on our success with our Core Values, and worked to support students in  using evidence from complex texts to create compelling arguments. In the 2018 - 19 school year we will be focusing  on five elements of the Framework for Great Schools: Rigorous Instruction, Supportive Environment, Collaborative  Teachers, Effective School Leadership, and Strong Family-Community Ties.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 09X517   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   424   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     In the 2017-18 school year, 18.8% of our students met the college and career readiness standards. This represented a  9% decrease from the 2016-17 school year. Additionally, our graduation rate decreased from 74% to 61.8%. This  12.2% decrease represents a focal point within our CEP and school community for the upcoming year.   Additionally, the 2017-18 Principal Peer Observation rated our school Developing in Assessments, and as a school  community we strive to improve through the introduction of interim assessments. Research shows that on-going  checks for understanding during the class period paired with strategically implemented interim assessments is one of  the key drivers of successful urban schools. Our school Quality Review also spoke to this as being an Area of Focus  despite a rating of Proficient.   Within our Regents Data ELA Average Score 58.9%, U.S. History Average Score 64%, Living Environment Average Score  62.1%, Global History Average Score 58%, CC Algebra Average Score 59.5%. This represents a an overall drop in our  average scores across the board. Additionally, our Average Completion Rate for remaining Regents stands at 32.1%.  However, the wide-range of the information provides another piece of evidence that further support of students  through on-going meaningful assessment will lead to increased student knowledge and student proficiency.   The information from the Regents exams showed that we required additional professional development related to  the design and implementation of rigorous tasks to grow collective student and school efficacy.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

Driven by Data - The Instructional Team will plan and create an  assessment calendar. This schedule will be thoughtfully modified  to allow for timely analysis and reflection by staff within  Department team meetings.   The school support team will pursue a clearly structured and  timed conference schedule along with Grade Teams to ensure all  scholars have knowledge of their path through high school and  what additional academic supports they need to utilize.   The school leadership team will work to ensure strategic  scheduling of scholars in their coursework to support their  growth towards college and career. This includes a second year  of Algebra for scholars who have not achieved College Readiness.  This will lead to a more comprehensive base of knowledge for  higher level coursework.

What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  The 2017-18 School Survey shows that parents, teachers, and students feel that the school creates a culture of  support and provides space for their social and emotional growth. Overall, the school received responses between  71% - 90% on a range of topics including Classroom Behavior, Guidance, Peer Support for Academic Work, Personal  Attention and Support, Safety, Social-Emotional, and Preventing Bullying. These marks showed a range of 1% - 14%  above the City Average.      The Quality Review labeled our school's culture of high expectations as Proficient. However, our 2017-18 attendance  rate school-wide was 75% which decreased 2% from the 2016-17 school year. Therefore, our school is looking to  provide an increasingly supportive environment with high expectations for all scholars. We will have built-in  incentives for scholars that are intrinsic (certificates), and extrinsic (trips of their choice).      To further develop a more supportive environment, Frederick Douglass Academy III became a Community School and  now functions as a hub of supports and services for students and families. Services offered to the school community  targets: youth development, mental health & social services, academic support, parent engagement & family services,  strong instructional improvements, academic enrichment, community development, and attendance improvement.

In the 2017-18 school year, 20% of our students met the college and career readiness standards. This represented a  8% decrease from the 2016-17 school year. Additionally, our graduation rate decreased by 74% to 62%. This 12%  decrease represents an area of we are addressing this summer and action planning with great intentionality.      Additionally, the 2017-18 Principal Peer Observation rated our school Developing in Assessments, and as a school  community we strive to improve through the introduction of interim assessments. Research shows that on-going  checks for understanding during the class period paired with strategically implemented interim assessments is one of  the key drivers of successful urban schools. Our school Quality Review also spoke to this as being an Area of Focus  despite a rating of Proficient.      Within our Regents Data ELA 35% Pass Rate, U.S. History 54%, Science 38%, Global History 34%, Math 40%. This  represents a wide range of student performance across demographics and 8th grade entry proficiency. However, the  wide-range of the information provides another piece of evidence that further support of students through on-going  meaningful assessment will lead to increased student knowledge and student proficiency.      The information from the Regents exams showed that we required additional professional development related to  the design and implementation of rigorous tasks to grow collective student and school efficacy.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership.

In the school year 2017-18, 81% of our families completed the Parent Survey for the school. This represented a 34%  increase. Additionally, we have prioritized family involvement through the use of targeted special events throughout  the school year such as the Senior/COSA Awards Banquet. We have hosted a holiday show, and invited parents to  attend as well.    During the 2017 - 2018 school year, the attendance of FDA III families increased by changing our approach to family &  community outreach by establishing a foundation of trust and building engagement opportunities. We used phone  banking around large events which led to an increase in participation at Family Night, and Parent Teacher  Conferences. Families were also informed of school events, resource opportunities, and scholars performance via text  messages sent through Kinvolved. We used our outreach efforts to ensure high attendance at school-wide events;  attendance of families increased in comparison to attendance of families in the 2017 - 2018 academic year (330, 2017  - 2018; 304, 2016 - 2017; 148, 2015 - 16).       Therefore, the school needs to sustain these practices of outreach to families and in order to bridge the home to  school connection in order to ensure we keep students on the road to success toward graduation. This data focused  our school-wide team into determining specific strategies and systems to improve parent outreach as well as monitor  that outreach.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  In terms of recruitment strategies, we rely heavily on internal referrals from people who currently work at FDA. We  believe they understand the mission/vision of our school and know the type of candidate that would best meet our  needs. Additionally, we use external recruiters, such as Teaching Fellows, and our relationship with universities –  Lehman College, Teachers College and Fordham. Once teachers are identified as possible hires, they are interviewed  by the following, in this order: department chair, assistant principal, and principal.      Candidates must conduct a demo lesson and are asked to spend a day at our school. Assignments are made based on  vacancies available and are based on qualifications, referrals and the interview process. The candidates are matched  to the vacancy. Once hired, they participate in new teacher professional development, facilitated by the principal and  department chair. They are assigned to a department based on their content and are provided a mentor. Like all other  staff members at FDA III, they participate in the goal-setting process. Initial goal-setting is mid-year and the end-of- the-year review.      The observation process consists of both informal and formal observations in accordance with ADVANCE. In addition,  department chairs conduct informal observations and teachers do inter-visitations of other teachers. Teachers attend  department conferences and team meetings, as well as grade-team meetings. Finally, they participate in bi-weekly  faculty conferences. We believe all of these ingredients are critical to recruiting, retaining and supporting highly  qualified teachers.        2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   Staff are required to attend professional development, not just limited to in-house PD’s; staff are given an  opportunity to attend workshops outside FDA III and are encouraged to do so. PD’s include topics such as CCSS   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          32      curriculum development, special programs, DOE guidelines and developing leadership skills.

Use of Program Resources   Describe how the TA program resources will assist participating children to meet proficiency.        3b. TA Coordination with the Regular Program   Describe the planning, coordination and support of the TA program with the regular educational program (i.e.,  providing ELT, accelerated, high-quality curriculum, including applied learning; and minimize removing children from  the regular classroom during regular school day).                Part 4: SWP Schools Only   4a. Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).  NA        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     FDA III established a Local Measures Committee to explore the State and Local Assessment Measures that are most  appropriate for our students. The team shared their findings with the teaching staff and made a recommendation to  the Principal. During weekly Department Meetings (PD), teachers discuss the data obtained from formative  assessments and use it to inform instruction.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33      each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34        Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. 09X517 in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       Frederick Douglass Academy III will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

Community  Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and  family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in  Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health &  Wellness.    Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s)   How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student  academic outcomes?   Through the Community School partnership with the Center for Supportive Schools, Frederick Douglass Academy III  will focus on (1) increasing engagement and students’ sense of belonging (attendance), (2) building student leadership  inside and outside of the classroom (scholarship) (3) building a safe and supportive learning environment by providing  comprehensive social and emotional supports to students. This work to build a foundation for academic success will  include:               implementation of three staff retreats during the year designed with the support of CSS focused on building  the facilitation skills of department chairs so their prepared to support the school in fulfilling the school-wide  instructional focus  implementation of one staff retreat to Ramapo camp site to continue team building  implementation of Achievement Mentoring to provide structures for discipline associates to support students’  academic success using a positive behavioral reinforcement approach  continuing to support the implementation of Peer Group Connection (PGC), including the implementation of  10th grade booster sessions to reinforce the PGC learnings for 10th graders     providing 1-1 counseling support and small groups for students to engage in to support social and emotional   development     partnership with Purpose Tutors to provide one-on-one and small group instruction     partnership with Spark House for poetry push-in for 10th graders to build engagement and knowledge of ELA   literary elements    Further, the CSD will be integrated into the Student Success Team and teacher team meetings to ensure the  integration of social and emotional and academic supports.      Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to  be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.    By June 2019, we will:   increase average daily attendance by 1.5%       decrease chronic absenteeism by 2%     engage 20% of families through participation in school events, leadership development support, and   connection to needed resources     decrease the number of scholars at risk of failing a class by 25%     engage at least 20% of the school population in a social-emotional support structure         Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Community School Annual Goal(s):  How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family  Engagement, and Health & Wellness--support your academic goals for students?     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43      Attendance Supports - FDA III will incentivize scholars to attend school more often and more consistently. Increased  attendance will result in an increase in academic success.  Family Engagement - FDA III will support families in developing the skills needed to support their children’s academic  success. Additionally, families will feel more welcome, resulting in an increase in communication with staff regarding  academic progress.   Rigorous Instruction - FDA III will build the capacity of it’s teacher leaders to lead effective meetings and use data  driven practices to inform their practices.   Health & Wellness - FDA III will support scholars by educating the learning community on the health and wellness  services available in the building and in the community. Students considered at-risk will be paired with a mentor who  will advocate for their specific needs. Scholars in good health are better prepared academically.

Describe how the school will partner with the Lead CBO to do the following:  1.   Community Schools are expected to partner with a community-based partner organization (CBO) and  together with members of the School Leadership Team, hire a Community School Director. The Director will  lead implementation of the asset and needs assessment process, and other critically important coordinating  activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work.  Community Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and  services, as determined by the asset and needs assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time  (ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the  right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly  coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day.  Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to  strengthen this initiative.  Community Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and  families feel welcome, actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of  their schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community  School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this family engagement  strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work.

Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use.  Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work.   1. The full-time Community School Director (CSD) was hired in partnership with school leadership and the SLT. The  CSD is responsible for the day-to-day management of the community school strategy. The CSD takes an active role in  building and implementing assets and needs of the school community. The CSD is a "community organizer,”  facilitating and providing leadership for the collaborative process of developing a continuum of services for children,  families, and community members. The CSD drives development of community school action plans and planning for  sustainability.    The CSD is included in the process of identifying CEP goals, monitoring the school’s progress on goals, and guiding the  learning community through the process of continuous improvement (re: CEP goals). The CSD tracks the school’s  progress against performance goals, reviews school data, supports program evaluation activities, and manages  partnerships. The CSD will ensure that the community school strategy is implemented at exceptional levels of quality  with full support, buy-in, and regular communication with stakeholders across the school community. Specific  position responsibilities will include:    • Build and maintain relationships with administration, faculty, staff, students, parents, and community partners   • Support the needs of administration, faculty, staff, students, parents, and community partners   • Organize and expand upon the membership of the Community School Team (CST) to include diverse school  community stakeholders and CBOs   • Conduct a needs assessment process, including: reviewing school and student-level data; conducting focus groups  with parents, students, faculty, staff, administrators, and community partners; and reviewing and/or conducting  school climate and culture survey at key times throughout the school year to inform continuous improvement   • Conduct a community asset assessment to identify viable partnerships that can meet the needs of students and  families of the school community, including ongoing partnership evaluation   • Recruit and develop partnership agreements with people and community organizations willing to offer programs  and services for students and families at the school in accordance with identified needs   • Identify evidence and research-based practices and/or partnerships that address priority areas for the community  school strategy, which may include but are not limited to: Parent/Family Engagement; Community Engagement;  Youth Development; Academic Rigor and Instructional Practices; Health and Mental Health; Tutoring; After school  programming; Mentoring; and Early Childhood   • Develop, maintain, and publicize a schedule of programs and activities offered at the school   • Implement and maintain a process that encourages referrals to programs and services offered at the school   • Identify needs of chronically absent students, apply interventions, and track and monitor impact of interventions on  weekly basis, as part of weekly Student Success Summit   • Collect and monitor program implementation data and student data for each partnership that allow easy data  analysis and interaction by the SLT, CST, and other school stakeholders.      2. The Student Sorter will be used on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis to identify and connect students (both  subgroups and individuals) in need of personalized/individualized supports. Prevention initiatives and intervention   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      initiatives will be tracked in the Student Sorter and this data will be analyzed regularly, in partnership with the CST  and other key school stakeholders, to evaluate effectiveness and to implement new strategies as needed.       Streamlined referral processes with Children’s Aid Society will be implemented to ensure that school  stakeholders know when and how to refer students and families in need of additional personalized supports  that emerge throughout the school year. A tracking tool will also provide a way to ensure that referrals are  followed up on and that services are delivered in accordance with the needs presented.      Partner programs will collaborate with teachers and others involved in instructional programming and regular   points of engagement will be implemented throughout the year to ensure a cohesive instructional approach  within and outside of the regular school day. Two examples include:    o  Through Peer Group Connection (PGC), 12th grade peer leaders will facilitate a “Faculty Outreach” in   which the faculty experience for themselves the PGC program. Through this experience, faculty will  become more knowledgeable about PGC and become better equipped to bring practices from the  program into their classroom.    o  Through Success Mentoring, mentors will regularly connect with teachers to learn about how their   mentees are feeling. Through this weekly interaction, teachers will also learn more about the work of  mentors and mentees and how they can support this work in their classroom.      o  o  3. In partnership with the principal, the CSD will form and subsequently convene monthly meetings of   a Community School Team (CST) whose membership will include: members of the School Leadership  Team (SLT), other key school staff and/or faculty, key staff from other partner CBOs, parents, and  students. Through this meeting, issues will be regularly communicated to and discussed by the group.  An annual Community School Forum will engage parents in authentic discussion to learn about the  community school strategy and provide feedback on areas of success and areas for improvement.  Surveys and focus groups with parents will also be held at key times throughout the school year to  inform continuous improvement.       The CSD will support the administration in identifying a parent coordinator best fit for FDA III.    The CSD will also work with school administration and staff to identify parent leaders to define and  implement strategic initiatives to better engage parents in their child’s education and support the  community school. Planned initiatives designed to support authentic parent engagement include:    o  PGC Family Night -- parents are welcomed to an evening event facilitated by student peer leaders   designed to help parents learn more about PGC, learn more about their child’s experience  transitioning to middle school, and to dialogue with other parents about their own challenges  supporting their child’s transition to middle school.    o  Monthly positive parent outreach -- parents will receive specific positive progress updates from staff   on at least a monthly basis.      o  o  4. The principal, CSD and other members of the Student Success Team will meet for one period on a   weekly basis to review the Student Sorter, using the meeting agenda protocol recommended by  NYCDOE. During this meeting, the team will review attendance trends and specific student cases to  identify and implement next steps and interventions. If questions arise about Student Sorter data, the  CSD will serve as the school’s liaison to New Visions’ to address questions and build capacity within  the school around Student Sorter proficiency.

We have found that our ENL population has the most  difficulties with their writing.  These scholars need additional supports to supplement their  instructional classes.  We will have our ENL certified teacher work in small groups with these  scholars on a weekly basis.  The small group instruction will concentrate on language acquisition  and writing.  We have purchased Rosetta Stone in English for the scholars to work at their own  comfortable pace.  The groups are determined on English proficiency of the scholar.  The groups  will meet with the ENL teacher once a week for additional supports.  The small groups are  extended to the after school program and the Saturday Academy classes.    The after school program will meet on Wednesday, Thursday from 2:45 until 4:45 pm beginning  in September and ending in June.  The groupings are sorted by proficiency levels with the  regular education teacher facilitating and the ENL specialist rotating between classroom  directing the facilitation.  This program begins in October, and runs until June 2018.    The Saturday Program is designed for  additional supports for the scholar as well as any family  member who would like to participate in language acquisition.  The program meets on select  Saturdays, depending on holidays, from 9:00am -12:00 noon.  This program begins in October  and will end June, 2019. The program will meet for approximately 20 Saturday's over the course  of the year at two times per month.    We will be utilizing additional funds when the Title III funds are exhausted, this will continue  the program in its entirety.  The writing, additional instruction is in the form of free writing using a prompt with a three  paragraph format.  The writing allows the ENL scholar to write in English while using the translation glossaries and  dictionaries.

On the 1st two  Fridays of the month from 2:00-2:50 pm is our Common Prep time where all teachers, meet to  collaborate with their English Language Learners co-teachers.   We introduce the ELL scholars  and analyze their NYSESLAT data together.  We discuss the different ELL models   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51         Part C: Professional Development   available.  We discuss various strategies that any teacher should implement for our ELL  population.  We discuss best practices amongst colleagues.  We continue to uncover a variety of  additional topics concerning our ELL population.  This is at no cost to Title III.    Our ENL Teacher has attended many outside Professional Developments that focus on ELL  instruction and were presented by ELI.  This focused on student management and resources  available to the ELL scholar.    In addition, professional development for the ENL Regents program instructors, which includes  2 content area teachers and 2 ENL instructor, will be provided by the ENL coordinator as a way  to incorporate best ENL teaching practices in the content areas within the Regents ENL program  after school program. As a part of the professional development program, Stephane Paul (the  ENL Coordinator) will focus on different co-teaching approaches and specific scaffolds that  would benefit the ELLs in this program. In addition, word walls, pictures and images, translation  dictionaries, Regents glossaries, video, and various forms of technology that we have at our  disposal will be suggested to use and models will be taught on how to use the aforementioned  scaffolds and resources. We will hold these PDs once a month after school and, to supplement  these PDs, the ENL Coordinator and content area teachers will meet for common planning time  for the after school Regents program which meets weekly on Wednesday's and Thursday's from  2:45 - 4:45 pm. Some topics that will be covered for these PDs will be: scaffolds and  modifications for ELLs, co-teaching approaches and strategies, and test taking strategies for the  Regents exam, and writing for purpose. Our data team has analyzed our Regents Data.  This  analysis has yielded the need to focus more preparation on the written portions of  the NYS Regents exams, as well as college entrance exams and essay submissions.  How to write  to a purpose is one important focus of these PD opportunities.  These are at no cost to the Title  III funding.    Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact  higher achievement for ELLs.

Our parent coordinator uses the  Saturday Regents Prep Academy time to welcome in the parents.  She hold workshops for  parents to associate themselves with NYC, particularly the Bronx.  She highlights the various  agencies available to the parents and the purpose of the agency.  We have purchased Rosetta  Stone in English and will begin to give group instruction to these parents on Saturdays who are  able to sign up.  We also offer various workshops throughout the year both after school and on  Saturdays.  We focus these workshops on learning the Pupil Path system, which accesses their  scholars grades and assignments.  We have our ELA department implementing and dissecting the  Common Core Learning Standards for our English curriculum for our parents.    We have extended the parent involvement time to a specific ENL parent support workshop.  We  invite the parents into the school on the first Tuesday of the month.  The Parent Coordinator will  compile the agendas, sign in sheets and the feedback forms and keep them on file.

The supplies and Rosetta Stone are using the Title III funding.    During the Saturday English program for parents of ELLs, the ENL instructor will teach parents  to improve the 4 modalities of English (reading, writing, speaking, and listening) on topics such  as: resume writing, writing cover letters, interviewing skills, and survival English focusing on  accessing community resources and how best to support their child in school. The ENL  coordinator, Stephane Paul, and Ms. Genesis will notify parents through translated letters,  communication by phone, through email, and meetings in person explaining the Saturday  English literacy program available to the parents of ELLs.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  In the 2018 - 2019 school year we administered homemade baseline formative assessment in order to determine base reading,  vocabulary, and writing proficiency. Additionally, we utilize quarterly interim assessments in the four core subjects ELA, Math,  Science, and Social Studies to measure proficiency and growth throughout the year.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Our two ENL teachers meet within the ELA department weekly to plan and determine their next steps for their instruction.  Additionally, they have a co-planning period with their ELA teachers as we use push-in support for our intermediate and  advanced ENL scholars.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56         We have utilized the quarterly interim assessments which our school designed to determine next steps for our ENL scholars.  Additionally, we refer to the NYSESLAT data from the prior year. Within this we have seen that writing is a core area of need  for all of our ENL scholars. This has led to targeted professional development in literacy strategies for all teachers at the  school.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    This year, we have created a Saturday Academy where our ENL scholars can come for individual or small group tutoring related  to their Regents exams or their coursework with an outside tutoring organization "Purpose Tutors" who pair with one of our  ENL staff members.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   For grades 9 - 12, we identify scholars who are in need of additional ENL support and have them in courses and sections taught  by teachers who are comfortable communicating in both English and Spanish. For other scholars, we ensure they are paired  academically with a peer who can support their language development through structured classroom collaboration.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   We utilize our Regents data, the EDAT report, and the NYSESLAT to determine our next steps within the ENL program. This  past year, we noticed that many of our students did not advance one proficiency level due to gaps in writing and our ENL  programming. This year, we have adjusted the program to better support our entering and emerging ENL scholars.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   As a school, we utilize the EDAT and monthly EDUR to ensure we are providing structures to support all of our ENL scholars. As  mentioned above, we have created a separate program with additional supports for entering and newcomer ENL scholars. We  are evaluating the efficacy of this approach through scholarship reports, Interim Assessment data, and their upcoming  Regents.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   At FDA III we have two different models for instruction. Our ENL program provides integrated ENL services through  the scholars' ELA classes. This is provided by Ms. Paul and Ms. Marte in grades 9 - 12. Additionally, the ENL instructor  can push-in or pull-out the scholars during that time period. Within the integrated classroom, ENL scholars are  grouped homogeneously in order for Ms. Paul and Ms. Marte to deliver services in a targeted manner. In other  content area classes our teachers use scaffolds and heterogeneous grouping of our Transitioning ENL scholars to  facilitate further language acquisition. In addition, Entering and Emerging ENL scholars have a separate program in  order to receive multiple periods of stand-alone services as well as integrated services in Social Studies, ELA, and  Science.   b.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Instruction is delivered according to the mandated number of units stated in the NYS CR Part 154 we determine this  information from the EPRG pg. 38, the EDAT data, and from our STARS and EDUR information. The entering students receive  their 540 minutes of service through a combination of classroom instruction and push-in. Transitioning ELLs get 360 minutes of  instructional time and expanding ELLs get 180 minutes of instructional time. Through the ENL integrated and the standalone  ENL courses, ELLs are able to get the maximum number of minutes specified above. The standalone ELL course contains the  transitioning and entering ELLs and the rest of the minutes for ESL instruction are within the integrated part of the  Freestanding ENL program. As for the expanding ELLs aside from the transitioning and entering ELLs, Mrs. Marte provides  instructional minutes as part of the integrated ENL co-teaching model to support expanding ELLs. ELLs are programmed in  STARS accordingly.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   All ESL classes are conducted in English. We utilize the literacy strategies outlined in the DOE policy guide to emphasize reading  of rigorous engaging texts, daily writing, opportunities to discuss/make meaning, and high-impact vocabulary development.  Our ENL scholars are further supported through scaffolding. We provide this through intentional grouping with scholars who  have higher fluency, and collaborating with the ENL team and our departments. Our teachers work to translate information  where appropriate and to build language acquisition strategies into their lessons.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   When a new scholar arrives at our school we administer the Spanish LAB to determine home language proficiency where  appropriate. Additionally, we utilize translated exams to our ENL population to ensure they can access the material in two  languages.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    A.) Our SIFE population receives social-emotional supports in addition to ENL services. They meet with our on-site Social  Worker to discuss any possible challenges they are having related to school integration. D.) Our long-term ENL scholars have  lived a long period of time in the United States more specifically New York City. They have had many obstacles in their ability  to test out of being ESL students in the DOE system. We support them with after school supports in reading and writing as well  as Saturday Academy. Mrs. Marte along with their content area teachers use graphic organizers specifically geared towards  organizing information. Ms, Marte chunks texts with scaffolded questions and utilizes organizers that help them write their  essays. If necessary, Mrs. Marte gives them the opportunity to use translation dictionaries, sentence frames, frontload of  vocabulary, and grammar minilessons to support their writing. (b.) Our newcomer scholars are provided the NYSESLAT and  Spanish Lab where appropriate, they are then placed into services with additional ESL courses and academic courses taught  bilingually in order to facilitate language acquisition over time. (c.) Developing ELLs will receive the same type of scaffolds as  SIFE and Long Term ELLs, but also will receive text in both English and Spanish, English and French, texts dealing with the same  content as their core classrooms focusing on basic English vocabulary and grammar, and images and pictures will be used to  develop new English vocabulary. If necessary Newcomers and Developing ELLs will get help from Mrs. Marte utilizing their first  language to access English language skills. (e.) Former ELLs continue to receive services related to testing and other offerings  for the subsequent two years.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Our teachers use graphic organizers, daily writing prompts, opportunities to discuss content, and sentence stems in order to  support their growth. Additionally, ELL-SWDs receive SETTS supports and are in a small group for 8th period lunch and learn to  provide additional academic supports. These supports vary by grade as all teachers are available to support them during Lunch  and Learn.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  For our ELL-SWD students, Mrs. Marte currently uses the ICT co-teaching model with content area teachers and special  education teachers. Within her schedule,she has the flexibility to co-teach classes with a substantial amount of ELLs with IEPs  giving them the support to develop their language skills along with helping the students attain their IEP goals. Mrs. Marte  collaborates tremendously with special education teachers to get insight into the cognitive and socio-emotional needs of the  ELL-SWD population. For the aforementioned ELL population we use the ICT model as a form of integrated ESL instruction. Mr.  Hartnett our special education liaison works in collaboration with the ENL team to set-up IEP goals and language acquisition  goals for each student. We also use i-Ready as a diagnostic to determine entering proficiency in math and ELA.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  The targeted intervention plans for each ELL student is designed by the teachers during their common planning time on a  weekly basis. Interventions are written into the students individual intervention plan. All courses are offered in the English  language. The intervention services range from one-on-one interventions with teachers to whole group learning objectives and  focus meetings with groups of students. Our targeted interventions for ELA, Math, Social Studies, and the Sciences are done  through our lunch and learn period at the end of the day. Mrs. Marte caters to ELLs needing extra scaffolds and supports in  each of the above content areas while collaborating with content area teachers for extra supports. These intervention services  are provided in Spanish. We also have utilized a credit recovery program that allows ELLs to do alternative assignments in any  of the content areas that they are struggling in as an opportunity to recover credits that they have lost previously. These  resources are targeted for our beginner and newcomer populations.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      This current school year we created an intensive ELL schedule for our schollars in which they received English (basic reading  and writing skills) with our ESL teacher, Mrs. Marte, Global History with the regular classroom teacher and a bilingual  extension teacher and U. S. History with our Bilingual extension teacher.  Both programs were to support ELLs in the content  areas while helping them recover credits where they were lacking. We plan to continue supporting ELLs in their academic  deficiencies for the upcoming school year.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A        11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Our ELLs can take full full advantage of one extended day and after school programs and activities. We have a variety of  enrichment clubs (from Art, Cooking, Chess, Yearbook, etc.), quarterly that all students are eligible to participate. We also have  baseball, volleyball, and female and male basketball teams through the PSAL. The programs are promoted to all scholars and  fliers are accessible in multiple languages. We have after-school lunch and learn, PM school, sports teams, and clubs.  Additionally, we have a Saturday Academy program from 9:30 - 12:30 where our ENL teachers provide additional targeted  support for ENL scholars.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59         Our ELL population has full access to our school's instructional resources. We have technology in the form of chrome books  and other devices as well as Rosetta Stone. We have purchased Spanish - English and other language dictionaries to support  scholars. We are exploring additional programs including i-Ready and Grade for our ENL population.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Students are given the option of using native language-English dictionaries in class if they want in our freestanding ESL  program. Additionally, scholars have bilingual glossaries, a buddy system, and the option to take the Regents in their native  language.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Our ENL services are provided by grade and proficiency level. Scholars are with their age appropriate scholars to ensure social  comfort, and when necessary placed into alternative sections for additional language support with scholars at their language  proficiency level.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Our school is apart of a campus, however, we do not share many resources as the other 2 schools are middle school and we  are a High School. We do however, share a library, auditorium, and gym and these are coordinated at Campus Council  meetings.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   All students are appropriately tested with the NYSITELL and Spanish Lab, additionally we have a Summer Bridge program which  involves our Parent Coordinator, School Counselor, and teachers to ensure all new students are comfortable at FDA III.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    FDA III offers only Spanish currently for those interested.        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Paste response to question here:        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Our ENL personnel attend professional development with the BFSC. These topics vary and allow for them to grow  pedagogically and to build their skills as ENL educators. Additionally, we have sent these teachers to an ENL co-planning PD at  Fordham University. These professional development agendas etc. go into the teachers cumulative file.    Our ENL staff also meets with our English Department. Our school is currently involved in a program called LPNTPP, which  includes 3 schools as a triad where we each visit and  share best practices in our mentor programs and in our schools in  general. Our TESOL program is involved in this and includes two ELA teachers and 1 administrator. As for the remainder of the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         staff, Mrs. Marte turnkeys information from the ESL PDs to our guidance counselor, ELA department, and administrators in our  department or grade team meetings. We are currently in the process of setting up dates for our staff and administrators to  attend more TESOL PDs this year.    Our TESOL teacher attends twice weekly content meetings that address the CCLS and the individual courses for our scholars.  All teachers of ELLs have the supports usually indicated in their units of study and their individual lesson plans. Our guidance  counselors receive training from our licensed ESL teacher in ways to assist new incoming ELLs. In addition, Mrs. Marte, attends  PDs addressing new trends in TESOL within the city and how to help teach ELLs to access and be successful in their content  area courses. These PD agendas will be kept for sign-in and agendas on file within the instructional team.    Additionally, our guidance staff and front-office staff attend professional learning on Respect for All, Language Translation  Policies, and other key information supporting our ENL population.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Our week long transition to high school and the FDA III learning community student orientation allows for a better  understanding of expectations in high school. The staff are required to include differentiation and scaffolds in their lesson  plans for their specific ELLs. The ESL teacher supports the teachers in writing their lesson plans and add scaffolds specific to  individual ELLs. Currently, as stated in number 1, we turnkey TESOL PDs to our staff including our guidance counselor during  grade team meetings and department meetings. In addition, we plan to have our school guidance counselor to attend PDs with  Mrs. Marte, TESOL coodinator, throughout the year. Specific dates have yet to be confirmed for our guidance counselor to  attend TESOL PDs.        The ELL training will be provided by Mrs. Marte, our ESL teacher, along with Takeisha Babb, our English Department Chair. The  trainings will be throughout the school year during the common planning time. Attendance sheets and agendas are kept on file  for these meetings.    Additionally, we send our ENL teachers to ELL PD's outside of the building to further their professional growth and tie-in  specific language acquisition strategies as part of our Literacy Plan and PD focus on reading complex engaging texts,  talk/discuss to build both conversational and academic language and knowledge, write to build language and knowledge, and  the use of high-utility vocabulary.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Mrs. Marte contacts parents regarding the progress of an ELL in the content area classes and in their language development. If  there is an academic concern, she recommends a meeting with the ELL's parent with the appropriate translation services. The  ELLs with the highest need in terms of success in their content area classes and language development are the entering ELLs  and Mrs. Marte is regularly in contact with their parents to ensure they are receiving the ESL support that they deserve. These  one-to-one meetings with families are scheduled on a rolling basis and records will be kept in the ENL binder as appropriate.      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   As a school, we work to engage all of our families. We have modest participation through our school conferences and other  school based events typically with 100+ families attending our parent teacher conferences ~25% and approximately 60%  responding on surveys. We use multiple forms of communication such as our online grading system (Skedula). Mrs. Marte is   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61         able to contact our parents daily to give reports using this system. In addition, we use Kinvolved, which sends direct text  messages to parents and provides additional communication. We also have our Parent Engagement Tuesdays and Student  Leadership Team meetings.  In addition, we also send out information to all parents including our ELL population in their native  language and we have curriculum nights for each core subject that our ELL population parents are invited to in their native  language. Translations are also available for these parents. These logs are kept electronically. Additionally, Mr. Ubardo heads  our Translation and Interpretation support unit to translate materials for our ENL scholars and families. Finally, our parent  coordinator is working to set-up specific outreach activities for our ENL families.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Jumel Carlos, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Frede                                                                              School DBN: 09X517  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Frederick Douglass Academy III utilized the home language surveys as the initial method to analyze our language  needs. The Pupil Accounting Secretary looks into ATS to find all parents’ prefer language of communication for all  of our students. We "tag" our home with this information so we know to send notices/reports/all  correspondences to the home in the parents’ prefer language. We will create a report using data from ATS stating  the Preferred Languages for ELLs and parents of ELLs, blue cards data, parent surveys, and teacher surveys  (advance teacher surveys given to students annually). All this information will be culled into a spreadsheet. We  will use in-house staff language, in the event that a language is not represented          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65         Language    Written Preferred    Percent Written    Oral Preferred    Percent Oral    3   1   5   3   1   403   198   3   1      Afrikaans   Arabic   Bengali   French   Nahutatl   English   Spanish   Soninke   TWI   Data as of September  12, 2018           0.49   0.16   0.81   0.49   0.16   65.21   32.04   0.49   0.16      3   0   5   3   1   404   198   3   1      0.49   0   0.81   0.49   0.16   65.37   32.04   0.49   0.16      3.
