This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Mission Statement: P.S. 161, The Crown School is committed to involving all students, parents, staff and community  resources in an effort to develop healthy, emotionally, socially and academically high performing students as we  prepare them for college and career readiness.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    P.S 161 is a Pre-K-5 school serves a population of approximately 373 students. The majority of the students come  from low-income families as 86% of our students receive free or reduced-priced lunch. We have two full-day Pre- Kindergarten classes.      Technology is a key component in the academic program at P.S. 161. We have a computer lab with 32 new  computers. There are 6 3D printers in the lab, as well as a laser machine.. Students work on programming and game- coding. Every classroom is equipped with a brand new Promethean Interactive Whiteboard, as well as 2-3 new  computers that students work on throughout the day. There are three laptop carts and three iPad carts that the  teachers can use in their classrooms. Each teacher also has their own individual iPad.      We strive to create a safe, nurturing environment for all of our students. Through our PBIS program, Spirit Day  assemblies, School Implementation Team meetings, Respect For All Week activities, Morning Affirmations we are  establishing a culture that communicates high expectations for all, builds trust and positive attitudes that supports  the academic and personal growth of students.      As stated in our mission, we strongly believe in developing students socially and we do this through the arts. We strive  to immerse all of our students in one of the disciplines of the arts during the school day or in extracurricular activities  after school. This year we started Enrichment Fridays, a project-based learning program during the school day, where  students had a choice on which activity they wanted to join, such as: Robotics, Chess, Legos, Spanish, Sign Language,  Dance, Yoga, Quilting, and Stepping. Some of our after school activities include basketball, track, violin, steel pan,  drama, band, and dance.      In consideration of our students’ social-emotional development, we held an assembly conducted by NED - N (Never  give up) E (Encourage others) D (Do your best). Earlier in the school year, the NED program returned to PS 161. A 45  minute character education assembly was presented promoting positive attitudes and encouraging students and staff  to do their best every day. Follow-up lesson plans and resources were provided to teachers to build on the excitement  created by the initial assembly program making a long-lasting impact on our students. NED is a show that visits 2.5  million students each year throughout the U.S., Canada, U.K., and New Zealand.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Three percent (3%) of our students are English Language Learners and 16% of the student body has Individualized  Educational Plans.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Our key area of focus this year is to use the data we collect to meaningfully adjust the curriculum and drive instruction  resulting in multiple entry points for every student. According to the 2016-2017 QR, we collect a lot of data, however,  minimal evidence exists to demonstrate how adjustments are made based on the data.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10         Professional learning will continue to focus on looking at and analyzing student work, making curriculum adjustments,  and providing all students with meaningful and cognitively engaging tasks.                  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 17K161   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   0K,01,02,03,04,05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   367   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Indicate the data trends, source and year.     ❖ According to the preliminary feedback from the 2016-17 QR, “There is uneven engagement in collaborative tasks,  higher-order thinking and discussion for all students including students with disabilities and English Language  Learners.” In order to support and facilitate the quality implementation of rigorous and coherent curricula  appropriately aligned to the CCLS, we have become a part of the Teachers College Reading and Writing Project to  support English Language Arts and GoMath to support Mathematics. Our teachers attended professional  development on implementation of the programs as well as providing intervisitations to schools within the district  and intravisitations between classrooms in order to support instruction for all students. We are in our second year of  implementation with these programs and will continue to need support until mastery of the program components are  achieved.    ❖ According to the feedback from the 2016-17 QR, “minimal evidence exists to demonstrate how data-based  adjustments are made to ensure that all learners are cognitively engaged.” Our teachers have been engaging in data  analysis using the pre and post unit assessments as well as using protocols for looking at student work. In grade  teams, they then use this data in order to make adjustments to unit and lesson plans. Ensuring that this was in place  was a first step for what is now our instructional focus, providing targeted data-based instruction through small  groups, namely guided reading. TCRWP and our Math Lead are supports which we have put in place to ensure success  for all teachers and students. This will be ongoing work throughout the year.     According to the feedback from the 2016-17 QR, “all learners are not provided with cognitively engaging tasks  which allow for higher order thinking.” In order to address this need we have designed professional learning activities  which are focused on ‘backwards mapping’ which identifies the tasks and assessments which will guide teaching  objectives and measures for achievement of objectives. In addition our cycle of observations and meaningful  feedback are allowing us the opportunity to give explicit feedback to specific teachers that may be struggling with  providing cognitively engaging tasks for all learners.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Areas for improvement are to communicate with parents the purpose of reading levels and ways their child can make  progress. The goal is for parents to understand their child’s strengths and weaknesses in the areas of reading, writing  and math and provide them with supports they can use at home. Our student data shows a decrease in the number of  students performing at levels 3 and 4 in Math. A needs assessment showed that parents find it difficult to help their  children with math homework. We will offer workshops for parents during the parent engagement time to help  parents understand the math and how they can support their children at home.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and  Time-bound.   By June 2019, administrators and the parent coordinator will collaborate to provide monthly events for families which  will support students, and families, with socio-emotional care strategies in the home environment, and provide  strategies for fostering a strong reading culture resulting in the strengthening of the home/school partnership. This will  be measured by a 5% increase on the ELA state assessment.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44        Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS 161K in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       PS 161 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability  grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g.,ESSA/State accountability  system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report, Learning  Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between /teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

All ELLs, other than those here for less than a year, are now required  to take the ELA exam. Some ELLs must take all other content area state mandated exams: Math, Science. The data provides  information about ELLs’ English proficiency levels. Most of the ELLs are beginners -entering. Some of them are low  intermediate level -emerging. Only a few are advanced level -expanding. This information helps inform our school’s  instructional plan. Teachers modify their teaching plans to meet ELLs’ needs. We design our school instructional plan that  helps ELLs to develop word reading and spelling skills in context. We design phonemic and phonics instructions to help ELLs to  promote their phonemic awareness and develop phonic skills. Our school collaborative teaching team program is offered  specifically to ELLs. With team teaching support the ELLs become more literate and their English language proficiency levels  are improved.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?        3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  It is written in number 8.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?         5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]        RtI is an instructional model that aims at prevention and early intervention through a tired system of instructional support.  RtI model holds significant promise for better serving ELLs who are at-risk for academic difficulties. We use Strong Core  Instruction for ELLs-Tier 1 to make the instruction focus on promoting language and literacy development. In our school, only  once a rigorous, effective instructional core is in place-one that targets the student population's needs on a daily basis as part  of a long-term plan, we begin to build interventions that will serve truly supplemental and supportive instruction. We use  instructional strategies that support differentiated, Tier 1 instruction to promote ELLs' literacy development. We assess and  evaluate some ELLs for special education - Tiers 2 and 3. The ELL teacher focuses to develop a profile that includes information  about the student's strengths as well as areas needs.   Data        A data management system has been established in the school building that houses ELLs’  performance data electronically.  Data are used to determine the effectiveness of RtI by examining the following kinds of data over time: A. Number of ELLs  meeting benchmark per grade level per year B. number of ELLs receiving Tier 2 & Tier 3 interventions by grade by year C.  number of ELLs referred to special education by grade per year D. Movement of ELLs across tiers over time. ELLs level efficacy  data are used to make improvements to the school’s overall RtI process. RtI is principally featured or embedded within my  school’s improvement plan. My school has an implementation plan that will guide the RtI process over the next 3-5 years. A  specific RtI model has been adopted in my school which specifies the number of tiers , types of interventions at each tier,  screening, and progress-monitoring. My building has a detailed plan for evaluating the effectiveness of the overall RtI  implementation. The plan includes who will be conducting the evaluation and what types data need to be collected.  Tiered Intervention        Tier 1 – Instruction in ELLs Classroom        The ELL reading program addresses the 5 pillars of reading : Phonemic awareness, decoding/phonics word recognition,  fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. The ELL reading program is aligned to NYS ELA standards and grade level, meets The  ELLs’ needs, and reflects research-based instruction that is systematic and explicit. The reading is established and routinely  implemented. The ELLs’ teacher differentiate reading instruction based on the abilities and needs of ELLs in our school. The ELL  reading instruction is provided during an uninterrupted 90 minute block per day.        Tier 2 – Instruction in ELLs Classroom         A menu of research-based instruction interventions is available in the school for the purposes of matching to ELLs’ needs.  Additional or supplemental instructional time ( At least 20-30 minutes per session, 3-4 times per week ) is offered in addition  to the 90 minutes provided in ELL reading instruction. Checks for fidelity of implementation of intervention are conducted on a  regular basis. Data from progress monitoring assessments are used to evaluate whether the ELLs is responding the  intervention in this tier. Interventions are implemented on a consistent basis at a level that is specified by program.  Interventions provided at Tier 2 are research-based and implemented by the ELLS’ teacher who is knowledgeable about the  ELLs’ needs and trained in the needed area of instruction. Interventions are matched to ELLs’ needs. Tier 2 interventions are  delivered in small group formats ( no more than 5 or 6 ELLs per group ); groups are homogenous. Tier 2 interventions are  provided as soon as ELLs at-risk status is determined. ELL instruction in Tier 2 is consistent with core instruction in terms of  vocabulary and strategies.        Tier 3 – Instruction in ELLs Classroom        Additional or supplemental instructional time  ( at least 60 minutes per session, 5 times per week ) is offered I addition to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      the 90 minutes provides in reading instruction. Interventions are matched to ELLs’ needs. Intervention is delivered in smaller  grouping format than Tier 2 ( 1:1 or 2:2 ). Checks for fidelity of implementation of intervention are conducted on a regular  basis. Data from progress monitoring assessments are used to evaluate whether the ELLs is responding to intervention  delivered in this tier. Interventions are implemented on a consistent basis at a level that is specified by program. Interventions  provided at Tier 3 are researched-bases and implemented by ELLs teacher who is knowledgeable about the ELLs’ needs and  trained in the needed area of instruction.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].         There is NYSITELL test for new admits in our school. Most of new admits are beginners who do not speak English. There  was NYSESLAT test in 2015 in our school. We have 6 Beginning levels ( Entering ), 4 Low Intermediate level s ( Emerging ), 4  High Intermediate levels (  Transitioning ), 1 Advanced Levels ( Expanding levels ), and 2 Proficient levels ( Commanding ).  The  NYSESLAT proficiency results provide information that the data patterns prove that after learning English for one,  two , or  more years the ELLs in our school have greatly improved English language proficiency. The information about ELLs’ weakness  and strengths in English language proficiency is revealed by the data patterns across proficiency levels on the NYSITELL and  NYSESLAT.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?

How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?                            a. The instruction and distribution of time is in accordance with part 154. Our B (Beginning - Entering ) and I ( low  Intermediate - Emerging ) level students receive 2 units (360 minutes) of ESL per week. Our A ( Transitioning and Expanding )  level students receive 1 ESL unit (180 minutes) and 1 ELA unit per week. On Professional Development Day there is workshop  for our staff in which ESL instructional minutes delivered in ESL program are emphasized.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      a. Content Areas Instruction     ELLs require the lesson plans explicitly state content learning objectives and language objectives. Best practices for ELLs  include an integrated approach so that learning is focused on achievement. Content learning objectives are defined as the  essential intended knowledge of the discipline. These are typically characterized by fact, concepts, and/or skills. They are  generated from several content sources. A content objective is a description of an observable student behavior or  performance that is used to make a judgment abut student learning. A content objective states explicitly what  students know  and/or will be to do at the end of the lesson. The ELL teacher develops content objective directly from the CCSS.Language  learning objectives are lesson objectives that specifically designed to promote students’ language development through all  four domains: reading , writing, speaking and listening. The ESL teacher designs language objectives that focus on  differentiation and effectively consider the level of English proficiency of the  ELLs ( i.e., beginner, intermediate or advanced ).  The ELL teacher understands that language skill development is developed from CCSS and executed with appropriate second  language acquisition strategies in reading, writing, listening and speaking. Language objectives must explicitly focus on  vocabulary, language form and function, grammar and syntax, as well as literacy skills.     The ELL teacher plans for the development of both social and academic language skills. The ELL teacher also demonstrates  knowledge about current scientifically based research in the fields of ELL and Cognitive Theory. The ELL teacher Provides  academic intervention for ELLs who have the English language deficiency, or low academic proficiency. The ELL teacher  differentiates ESL instructions to align with ELLs’ prior knowledge and their needs. The ELL teacher develops English language  and cognitive skills through content topics and themes. Content area instructions are designed to mediate the ELLs’ learning of  various proficiency classifications: new comers, long-term ELL beginners, intermediate and advanced proficiency levels.  The ELL teacher’s lesson plans are aligned to meet NYC and NYS ELL Standards which there is differentiation for the needs of  ELLs in our school.Ongoing assessment strategies are used to determine movement towards NYC and NYS content area  standards. Instruction of our ELLs is explicit, direct and systematic, emphasizing construction of meaning, problem-solving,  critical thinking, and vocabulary development in the content area.  b. Alignment of the ELL standards with the ELA standards        English language instruction is aligned to ELL standards and ELA standards. The ELL teacher scaffolds instruction to support  ELLs’ participation in content area learning. The ELL teacher uses visual and/or manipulative to promote ELLs’ understanding of  the main academic content. The ELL teacher models the use of the English language in ways in which the ELLs are expected to  participate. During the instruction, the ELL teacher uses the cultures of the ELLs to connect prior knowledge with new  language. Teaching materials include a wide range of print, visual, and digital resources designed for the ELLs’ English language  and academic language proficiency. English language functions and structure are taught within the content of lessons.  c. Methods and ELA standards Strategies        The ESL teacher speaks slower, models language and questions they ask themselves as they read aloud, speak aloud their  thinking process to answer questions and how to find needed information, become aware of cultural differences, gain  expertise knowing and implementing ELA and ELL standards, promote social interaction among all ELLs. The strategies  employed by ELL teacher include those highlighted in QTELC (Quality Teaching for ELLs) which focus on scaffolding. This  strategy covers a wide range of techniques that includes modeling, bridging, contextualizing, schema building, text  representation, and metacognitive development. These strategies are used along with cooperative learning, phonics  awareness, and independent reading and writing.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?                   We ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their native language by LAB Spanish test. The Spanish LAB is only  administered to new entrants who speak Spanish as their first language, and became entitled to ELL services via the LAB-R;  ELLS have the option of taking the math and science state exams in translated versions.                  5.

Describe your plan for long-term ELLs ( completed 6 + years ).  e.     Describe your plan for former ELLs ( in years 1 and 2 after testing proficiency ).            a. Instructional plan for SIFE    The ELL teacher provides SIFE ELLs with the literacy skills and concept development they have missed and help them   developenough academic English to survive in our school. The ELL teacher must help them build self-confidence and pride in   themselves, their culture, and their language. The ELL teacher enriches the linguistic context for SIFE ELLs by using pictures,  gestures,   intonation, and other nonlinguistic cues. The ELL teacher enriches the context by drawing on students’ interests and  background   knowledge. The ELL teacher uses a number of techniques to make the English instruction comprehensible, including hands-on  activities,   visuals and regalia including the following:  1) Manipulative, miniature objects, regalia.  2) Visual (photos, pictures and drawings)  3) Facial expression and pantomime  4) Clear expression and articulation  5) Short, simple sentences  6) Eye contact with students  7) High-frequency vocabulary  8) More description through synonyms  9) Prior content introduction (preview)  10) Reduction of idiomatic expressions    In order to accelerate the content-area learning for ELLs who have had an interruption in formal education our ELL program  runs at   extended time in the morning. In order to enhance literacy development for our SIFE students, ELL strategies and/or native  language   instruction are utilized, So that their academic performance improves. The ELL teacher applies stage of language acquisition,   teaching practice in order to focus on phonics awareness, word families, word and sentence building and integrated area  teaching   and learning. The ELL teacher modifies ELL teaching plans and makes curricular adaptations to teach SIFE students. The ELL  teacher   focuses on word recognition developing vocabulary, reading comprehension, oral expression, daily writing and integrated  content   area learning to transfer one level to the next.     b. Describe your plan for ELLs who have been in our schools less than three years          The ELL teacher uses scaffolding strategies and Balanced Literacy Reading strategies to develop ELLs’ English language skills.  The   ELL teacher meets with math teachers and literacy teachers on a regular basis to review ELLs’ work as well as to plan the next  phase   of ELL instruction. The ELL teacher designs learning activities that actively engage ELLs in ELL learning activities that build  critical    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      thinking skills. The ELLs are required to write on daily basis across all subjects, using a variety written forms including retelling,   paragraphs, summaries, stories, journals, brief reports, picture descriptions, charts and other graphs for math, social studies,  and   science information and explanation.     c. Describe your plan for ELLs receiving service 4 to 6 years          ELA and ELL teachers collaborate on lesson-planning and instruction that are designed to amplify ELLs’ knowledge in  content  area   reading strategies, identifying text structures, content-area vocabulary, literary elements, and text-taking strategies in  preparation   for the ELA exam.  Instruction also focuses on the writing process in different genres, as well as the mechanics of writing and grammar  conventions.   Recognizing the importance and effectiveness of instruction trough technology, the advanced ELLs are enrolled in a reading   intervention software program that is supplemented by classroom instruction in ELA. The math instruction is delivered by a  math   teacher and an ELL teacher at the Block Time. ELLs acquire knowledge and reinforcement of math skills. Instruction is clear  and   explicit. Demonstration of the topic under consideration is employed through the use of the blackboard, charts, overhead  project,   computer and manipulative. Test preparation will be a part of ESL program as well, to prepare ELLs who are now required to  take   the standardized NYS Math exams.     d. Describe your plan for long –term ELLs ( completed 6+ years )          There are no long-term ELLs in our school. If there are long-term ELLs, the ELLs are required to participate in a program that is   aligned with mandated ELL and content learning standards and the core curriculum. The long-term ELLs must participate in   instructions that are aligned with both ELL standards and ELA standards. The long-term ELLs participate in the Balanced  Literacy   program. This program assists the ELLs in developing their English language skills and reading comprehension. Teachers work   collaboratively to evaluate ELLs’ work and use data to ascertain the English language and cognitive demands of tasks aligned  to   NYC and NYS standards so that the long-term ELLs can demonstrate their learning through measurable products development,   demonstrations, and exhibits.     e. Describe your plan for former ELLs ( in years 1 and 2 after testing proficient )          The ELL teacher modifies ELL lesson plans and make curricular adaptations to teach those ELLs who struggle to understand the  basic   concept, provides teacher-direction, offers manipulative (flashcards, out of sequence sentence strips), Provides color-code  elements   (parts of speech, figurative language, quotes, and evidence in text), provides definitions/vocabulary/word bank, provides a  model   of the type of writing expected (persuasive essay, memoir, comparison/contrast essay, a critical lens essay, a book review, an   editorial, etc. for up graders), guiding with questions, provides sentences starters to help structure their writing, and providing  cloze   passages (with or without word tanks).                               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Our teachers engage ELL-SWDs in content learning activities to develop academic concepts. We draw on their background   experiences, their culture, and their languages. Our teachers use scaffolding strategies to provide content instruction to build   students' academic proficiency. Ready GEN, GOMATH, Science, and Social Studies are interrelated. Vocabulary is repeated   naturally as it appears in different content area studies. In the areas of the curriculum, the focus of planning and programming  is   often on the subject content. We determine the resources and teaching materials according to ELL-SWDs' levels. We often  consider   how to select and focus on English in all curriculum areas with the aim of developing ELL-SWDs' language proficiency and  academic   achievements. We deal with universal topics so that all ELL-SWDs can be involved. Lessons and activities can be adjusted to   different levels of English language proficiency. The materials that are used include grade-level content area text books , i  nforinformational texts, magazines, and newspapers.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  a. We implement the Pull-out and Push in models. The ELL teacher uses Pull-out model and brings the SES-SWDs together with   general education ELL students from various class for English acquisition focused instruction. The ELL teacher plans lessons  carefully   with general education teachers to ensure curricular alignment.  b. The ELL teacher uses Push-in testing during content instruction in collaboration with regular classroom teachers to  providelanguage   acquisition and vocabulary support while retaining content instruction time.  c. In order to serve our ELL-SWDs the ELL teacher uses differentiated teaching strategies and ELL methodology to provide  academic   subject instruction in English. The ELL teacher assists our ELL-SWDs to achieve the state designated level of English proficiency  for   their grade, and helps these students meet or exceed the common Core Standards.  d. Our school uses constructs of effective instructions: challenge, enrolment, success, scaffolding/feedback, collaborative  teaching for   second-language acquisition/sheltered English, and respect for cultural diversity.  e. Our school challenges students academically, challenge them to think, learn, and engage intellectually. Our school addresses  both   meaning and skills, promote both high-level thinking and appropriate drill and practice, and Provide complementary portions  of   student-teacher centeredness. Our school achieves continuity in curriculum and instruction as students move from primary to  middle to   upper grades and from different language to English language arts. The school builds upon and makes explicit the connections   between students' existing knowledge, skills, and experiences and academic curriculum to be learned ( including literacy,  language,   and content ). The school provides ELL program, reading and extended time, afternoon program, and Saturday program to  meet   the diverse needs of ELL-SWDs.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  1) We have Pull-out intervention program to provide individualized instruction in developing the four language skills. In this  program the first key to success is to engage ELLs in content area learning activities to develop academic concepts. The ELL  teacher uses a variety of instructional techniques as a way of developing second language, content, cognitive and study skills.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      We do our target intervention programing for language across the curriculum by identifying the functions of language such as  classifying, comparing, criticizing, describing, enquiring/questioning, explaining, evaluating, hypothesing, identifying, inferring,  predicting, refusing, reporting, sequencing, suggesting, wishing, and hoping.  2) To identify language functions currently being used in ELL program the ELL teacher tries matching some of teaching and  learning activities in ELL program with the relevant language functions. Our school checking that the ESL teacher is using a  range language functions throughout the ELL program will help ensure that the ELL teacher gives the ELLs opportunities to  hear and use it.  3) Our ELLs who exhibit inadequate growth on reading and writing receive 40 minutes at extended time per day in literacy  instruction using reading and writing interventions focused on helping them achieve grade-level proficiency in each essential  reading component ( phonemic awareness, phonics, spelling words, and sentences ). At dear reading time ELLs receive  individual help in class. In Math, Science, and Social Studies classes our cluster teachers help ELLs develop both language and  academic skills by the language functions. Our ELLs are given test accommodation for NYS tests.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      There is Title III Program. The ELL teacher will analyze the data and provide opportunities for improving reading and writing  skills of the ELLs. For the upcoming school year ELLs will write a variety of topics for improving reading and writing skills. Our  ELLs will discover more effective writing techniques with guidance of the ELL teacher and classroom teachers. Writing topics  are students - controlled. Writing will be reviewed as a collaborative, social process.  ELLs will assist one another in composing  texts. Grammar will be taught in the content of writing for ELLs ' communication. Feedback will be given throughout the  writing processing.         Teachers assist ELLs achieves higher skill levels, using explicit structures on how to engage in persuasive and expository and  voice. Teachers help ELLs develop skills through written arguments that respond to the ideas, facts, and arguments presented  in the texts, they listen to and read. Teachers explicitly and constantly use the language of math, science, and social studies to  help ELLs develop their ability to accelerate academic language development.        10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   NA          11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.   The ELLs are offered equal access to all school programs including extended day. ELLs participate in afterschool program and  Saturday Academic Program (Title III Program), and in extended time program. Parents of ELLs are informed of these programs  in their languages. In these program our teachers help Grades 4-5 ELLs at every level of language proficiency to engage  meaningfully in reading personal essays, speeches, opinion pieces, biographies, memoirs, etc. Teachers help them engage and  respond with comprehensible input to stories, literature, drama, poetry etc. Teachers help ELLs in all Grades understand text  by using pre-reading, during reading and after reading strategies. Teachers help ELLs to guide group discussions using four  strategies: summarizing, question generating, clarifying, and predicting. To assess their comprehension of a text, teachers  ensure that classroom experiences stay deeply connected to the text and that students develop habits for making arguments  as evidenced through the text in speaking as well as in writing.           12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.   There is library in ELL classroom. The school provides  ELLs with Ready Gen and Math Go textbooks, phonics books, fiction and  various materials and special resources that are needed ( Phonics ABCD, Connecting Vocabulary ABCD, Comprehension ABCD,  Quick Reads ABCD, Just Right ABCDE and Math practice books ). The ELLs use utilize technical, digital proficiency including, but  not limited to maintenance of an electronic portfolio and learning log, research on the internet use programs in computer and  the continued use of the computer.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?     In the ELL classroom the ELL teacher adds ELLs native languages and cultures to the school curriculum, encourages parents of  all groups to become involved in the school, using transformative models of teaching, and adopting types of assessment that  show what ELLs can do. The ELL teacher finds out about the schooling of parents and siblings to determine the kinds of support   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61      ELLs can be received at home. The ELL teacher allows ELLs to read their native languages . Reading in native Language develops  the academic register of ELLs’ first Language that reinforces English acquisition. An important strategy for drawing on ESLs'  native language s and teaching academic content Preview/View/Review. Key concepts are introduced by the ELL teacher or  parents in the students' native languages ( preview ). Then ELLs are given opportunities to work with those concepts in English  ( view ). The ELL teacher uses a number of techniques to make the English instruction comprehensible, including hands-on  activities, visuals, and realia. Finally, ELLs are allowed to review the concepts in their native language to clarify, summarize, and  ask questions ( review ). The ELL s will actively participate in cultural celebrations in our school. Lessons will be conducted to  build knowledge about cultural awareness and help ELLs gain a better understanding of the different culture:           14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.      Upgraders use Word Processors. Writing on a word processing is challenging to the ELLs. ELLs are able to work word  processors, especially if the programs are designed with them in mind. Computer network can provide an important means for  communicating with fellow ELLs in English. Their electronic discussions allow them to initiate and extend their discussions  about whatever it is that they happen to be studying or doing as a result of assigned work. Lower Graders use computer games  that can present simulations that call for the ELLs to make decision and they can require interaction with others involved in the  game. Computer games are currently available in content areas. For example, a Math program introduces ELLs to the concept  number lines, number pairs, and graph plotting. Computer games also include chess, word games, memory games, teasers  with missing numbers, and many more. They watch videos show real people in compelling scenarios like soap appears that  enable the ELLs to have input. Another use of interactive video is to teach the listening skills necessary for academic success.  Finally, a videodisk can also be used as a dictionary.         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?     There is library in ELL classroom. The school provides  ELLs with Ready Gen and Math Go textbooks, phonics books, fiction and  various materials and special resources that are needed ( Phonics ABCD, Connecting Vocabulary ABCD, Comprehension ABCD,  Quick Reads ABCD, Just Right ABCDE and Math practice books ). The ELLs use utilize technical, digital proficiency including, but  not limited to maintenance of an electronic portfolio and learning log, research on the internet use programs in computer and  the continued use of the computer.      16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   When the child arrives…the first few days teachers take the time to show the child around the school, so that he or she will  know where the places like the toilets and library are. Teachers establish a buddy system and use an interpreter or another  child to make sure the new arrival knows and understands regular classroom routines. Teachers teach some basic survival  language. Teachers discover how much English the new arrival has. We allow the new arrival the right to remain silent.     Providing support in the classroom         At times let pairs of children develop and teach mini lessons to the new arrival. We create opportunities for the new arrival  to participate in classroom situations, which do not require language. We involve the new arrival in lots of opportunities to  listen to English and interact with peers in a small group, use picture talks, provide activities which use skills that require  understanding rather than the productive skills of speaking or writing, provide a variety of activities where the child can work  with others in less structured situations, recall events orally, especially excursions in which the new arrival has taken part,  using drawings, photographs, objects collected or tapes, and use ' Written conversations '. The child begins by writing briefly  about anything he or she wishes and the teacher writes the response, where possible using this to model the correct forms of  any words or structures, which have been used incorrectly. The child responds in return.     Building on literacy skills        We allow the child to write in the first language, encourage the new arrival to continue to read regularly in the mother  tongue, and provide a bilingual dictionary or encourage the child to obtain one.     Getting settled   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62                We allow the child many opportunities to do what he or she is best at. We place the activities during the day so that the  child does not become exhausted. We set up situations where the new arrival is expert. We praise all success and share all  achievements with the child's parents.We give the new arrival opportunities to hear and practice social language, such as  asking for something, asking someone to do something, saying thank you and expressing disagreement politely. We make the  child feel a useful member of the class.     Activities        We give instructions clearly and precisely, use open-ended questions so that the child is able to respond at his or her own  level and use visual aids such as diagrams, maps, videos, pictures or mime to help make meaning clear. We try to get  information from the learner rather than always presenting it. We provide activities where the language is predictable or  repetitive. We include some activities which recycle newly learned language.  As far as possible design activities, which either use know language patterns to teach new vocabulary, or use known  vocabulary to model new language patterns. We use activities, which involve real communication and use whole class  activities where the new arrival can join as much as he or she feels able. In the early stages choose books and print materials  not only in terms of their language difficulty but also in terms of their cultural content.         17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    English is offered to ESLs.          18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.

N/A      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  1. The Professional Development Program will be a high quality and research-based program for our staff outlined in the  school’s comprehensive education plan. Professional development will engage all teachers in a variety of high quality  professional development activities, which will include study engaging ELLs with the CCSS standards, ELL scaffolding strategies,  and content area teaching strategies that are aligned with the CCSS and ELL standards. Our participating faculty will acquire ELL  methodologies and scaffolding strategies for improving instruction and promoting both language and academic proficiency for  ELLs. They will be trained to gain ability to engage in performance-based assessment that provides qualitative data. They will  be provided opportunity to collaboratively participate in small groups regularly, which allow for action research and sustain  ability of effective teacher practice. Our professional development activities accountability will be evidenced by: agendas,  training materials, focus groups, surveys, questionnaires, workshop evaluation-self assessment forms, attendance sheet, and  journal writing.  The following Professional development is offered to all teachers of ELLs.  1)  Common Core and English Language Learners  2)   Engaging Ells with CCSS.  3) Four factors of language Acquisition  4)  Diversity Among ELLs   5)  Six shifts in CCSS: English Language Arts/Literacy Standards  6)  Content and Learning Objectives: An integrated Approch   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63         7) Scaffolding: A bridge for Language and Content Learning to Achieve the Common Core Standards  8)  Language Development through Cognitive Processes  9) Accessing: Best Practice for ELLS  10) Common Core ELA Standards in Reading: Consideration for beginner ( Entering )and Low Intermediate ( Emerging ) level  ELLs        2.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:                                                                                   School DBN:     Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      1) Home Language Identification Surveys ( HLIS )    All parents of new admits to the school are required to complete HLIS as part of registration. The use of one in the  appropriate language facilitates its proper completion. We assess language preferences of the parent community  for both written and oral communication through the use of on-staff interpreters .    2) Parent Coordinator Interviews    3) ATS system provides information of the primary language of the students ( RHLA ).    4) Informal discussion with parents and teachers    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69      5) Interviewing students who speak languages other than English.    6) Providing interpreters during registration and at PTA meetings.    7) Analyze and interpret surveys to determine stuidents needs.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community.
