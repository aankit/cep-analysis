This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The Roberto Clemente School's mission is to have student achievement by providing a safe and collaborative  environment that will develop academic talents, promote critical thinking, and nurture the social and emotional  strengths of our students.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.

P.S. 13K is a Pre-Kindergarten through Grade 5 elementary school, with a student enrollment of approximately 500  students. The school is located in East New York, Brooklyn. Our student population is diverse in nature - 63% African  American descent, 30% Hispanic , 4% White and 3% Asia. Our English Language Learners constitute 15% of our  student body. 25% of our students are Students With Special Needs. Our pedagogues are experienced in elementary  education - 81% of the teachers have 3 or more years of experience as educators.      At P.S. 13K significant focus is placed on professional development for all staff members. As a result, we have  partnered with The Teachers College Reading and Writing Project. In so doing, teachers have opportunities to  participate in professional development conference days at Teachers College. Furthermore, Teachers College staff  developers visit the K-2 and 3-5 grade bands throughout the school year to collaborate with teachers in enhancing  their pedagogical practices in literacy, specifically in reading and writing. Additionally, a litany of mathematics  professional learning sessions and Lunch and Learn offerings are made available to all teachers during the school year  to propel their instruction in mathematics.      We have placed much emphasis on Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Music (S.T.E.A.M.) As a result of being  awarded the Keys of Inspiration/Lang Lang Grant, our students currently have the privilege of learning music theory  and classical piano in a $100,000 Piano lab. Due to this music education, students are now learning how to read music  and play with both the right and left hands and they are ecstatic to perform during the quarterly Arts Festivals. We  applied for and have been awarded a $500,000 Reso Grant from the Brooklyn Borough President. Due to this award,  all students in grades 2 - 5 have access to individual lap tops and we now have a newly state of the arts Mac Computer  Lab. We have been gifted with a licensed Visual Arts teacher who is committed to exposing our students to different  of art and showcases their art work throughout the school. Encouraging students to become critical thinkers is a  gravid focus; hence, much emphasis is placed on student engagement in inquiry during science classes. Moreover, our  school has an after school dance program by way of our partnership with Rhema Dance Company. Students in Pre- Kindergarten through the fifth grade have the opportunity of participating in this program. Students learn a plethora  of dances such as Ballet, African, Modern, Jazz, Broadway, Hip-Hop, and Contemporary.       Students engage weekly in Enrichment Clubs. Presently there are twenty-two clubs in existence. Some of the clubs  include: drama, quilting, kick-boxing, chess, yoga, french club, ping-pong, lacrosse, scrap booking, ensemble, track and  field, i-movie, lego-fantasy, young engineers, re-art and graphic design. Our youngsters are also engaged in a myriad  of extra-curricular activities such as dance, martial arts, the Step Team and District 19's Basketball League.       To enhance the social and emotional well beings of our youngsters, we have partnered with TRIAD. In so doing, all  staff members have been empowered with varying strategies to support students to reach their utmost potential. In  addition, due to the collaboration with the Community Based Organization, Institute for Community Living, additional  social and emotional supports have been rendered to our students, as well as their families.

Further, 22.6% of our  student population live in temporary housing. We currently partner with the "Bridging the Gap" Program to support  the academic and social emotional needs of our students in temporary housing.        4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Based on the 2017-2018 New York City School Survey, our school community showed significant growth in the area of  Trust - there was an increase from 2.33 to 3.60. Throughout the school year, time was allotted for restorative circle  conversations amongst staff and administrators and multiple collaborative conversations ensued to heighten  knowledge of students and colleagues.    During the 2017-2018 school year, our key areas of focus will include the following elements of the Framework for  Great Schools:     Rigorous Instruction    Collaborative Teachers   Strengths     High quality differentiated professional development is provided to all staff internally. Staff members are   given opportunities to attend external professional development     High expectations are communicated to all stakeholders; The Danielson Framework for Teaching is utilized to   hold teachers accountable as it relates to instructional practices     Professional learning cycles are aligned to the needs of staff and students     The Teachers College Reading and Writing Project is the school wide literacy curriculum.

What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Needs Assessment:   School administrators will monitor grade level teacher teams throughout the school year, as well as small group and  individual planning sessions to help meet the specific needs of new and veteran teachers. School administrators need  to schedule early grade inter-visitation with upper grade classrooms to observe the use of discussion prompts to  promote student-to-student discussions. The professional growths of teachers are addressed via ongoing  differentiated professional development and inter-visitations as a result of needs derived from sources such as  observations, data, and/or professional requests.      School leaders ensure that the school community collaboratively create and share SMART goals/mission and long- term vision inclusive of core values that address the priorities outlined in the CEP. School leaders make strategic  decisions to organize programmatic, human, and fiscal capital resources. After conducting a comprehensive needs  assessment of our schools academic program in response to this element of the Framework for Great Schools  (Effective School Leadership) using such data sources as Advance, Quality Review, School Quality Snapshot, the NYC  School Survey and other relevant data sources:   On the School Quality Review the school was found to be well developed in school leaders consistently  communicating high expectations, including elements of the Danielson Framework for teaching, through professional  development to the entire staff. School leader and staff effectively communicate expectations connected to college  and career readiness and partner with families to support student progress.    Areas of Strength:     All administrators in our school are supervisors as well as instructional leaders and communicate high         expectations on an ongoing basis either via parent meetings, professional development workshops, memos,  observation feedback, learning walk-throughs, common planning time, inquiry focused meetings, etc.  Supervisors use the Framework for Great Schools (FfGT) to establish clear expectations for classroom  practices and support teacher development  School administrators provide effective feedback that highlights strengths, identifies challenges and provides  next steps to promote professional growth and improve classroom practice based on the FfGT.  School Administrators continue to stay abreast of any updates or changes in the advance system       The school leaders have ensured that the school community collaboratively works on setting the school’s   annual goal  School leaders facilitate the collaboration of staff members in formulating our Instructional Focus.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          31      Area Of Need:     Our priority will be improving teacher effectiveness and pedagogy.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS13K, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      PS13K will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students     Providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level,   e.g., literacy, math and use of technology     Providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and      decision making in support of the education of their children   Fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress     Providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments     Sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and  in languages that parents can understand     Providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and  other members of the school community      Parental Involvement and School Quality   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:     Actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s   Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of  the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;     Engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated   directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills     Ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and      strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact  Support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the  Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

Currently, we have 49 English Language  Learners. All students will be invited to participate in the after school ENL Program, which will  be facilitated by licensed ESL/Bilingual teachers. We anticipate that each teacher will instruct  approximately 15 students.  Two teachers will facilitate the Title III ENL after school program.  The teachers will use English as the medium of instruction.  They will focus on improving the  language acquisition of all ELLs. Students will be divided into two groups; one pedagogue will  work with students from kindergarten, first grade, and second  grade; another pedagogue will  instruct ELLs from grades 3 - 5.  Below find a breakdown of our ELLs for the 2018-2019 SY:  Expanding/ commanding  4                                      / 2  0  5  1  5  0  1  1  3                                        / 2  0  1  2  2                                        / 2  2  5  0  6    We will run the program from November through the end of May.   The program will take place on Thursdays and Fridays from 2:30 PM to 4:00 PM.  Based on the NYSITELL assessment, all of our newcomers tested at the beginning level in all  four domains- speaking, listening, reading and writing.  Therefore, we decided to focus our  instruction and learning activities on the development and enhancement of their English  acquisition in all four domains.  Our newly arrived students who have no knowledge of the  English language and whose first language is Spanish will be provided with Bilingual  Spanish/English materials, such as GO MATH exercise books and Spanish trade books.  We will  use such materials to scaffold students' math and literacy skills.  Analysis of NYSESLAT data (2017-2018) indicates that reading and writing are the lowest  modalities among our ELLS.  Therefore, instructional focus and activities will heavily hone in on  developing students' reading and writing skills.  Additionally, phonics, fluency, vocabulary and  reading comprehension will be taught.  Our goal is to foster a love for reading, while teaching   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   various reading skills to enhance students' speaking and reading comprehension. Curricula will  be organized around “big questions,” involve authentic reading and writing experiences, and  provide textual choices and meaningful content for students. Our program will also focus on  developing phonemic awareness especially for the students in the entering, emerging and  transitional stages.  We will use methodologies learned from Teachers College Workshop to enhance literacy skills,  as well as content-area based materials so students can be exposed to rich academic  language.  The teachers will select complex texts for read aloud during meetings.  Through  deconstruction and reconstruction of the complex texts, students will learn different literacy  skills such as main idea, context clues, sequencing and characterization, as well as, content area  knowledge, grammar, and vocabulary.  There are seven special needs students among our  ELLs.  In order to support their needs, we will ensure all activities are scaffolded. One of the  most important steps in critical reading is to make predictions about a piece of writing prior to  the first real reading. For our emergent readers and special needs students, we will use a strategy  called taking a “book walk.” During a book walk, students are asked to preview the book before  they read any text and make predictions about the plot by analyzing context. For emergent  readers, this means looking at pictures and describing what they see. Teachers model this reading  strategy to the students. They will begin with the title and author of the book, sweeping a finger  under the words as they are read out loud. Next, they instruct the students to look at the pictures  on the cover. The teacher will then ask the student to make predictions about what he sees and  what he/she thinks the book will be about.  Afterwards, students will practice the specific skill  taught to them in their independent reading books (differentiation).  Next, students will have an  opportunity to discuss the strategy they focused on with a partner or whole class.  Other  scaffolding strategies the teachers will use are:  providing visual cues to help students understand  topics, chunking long readings into short passages so that students see only the section they need  to tackle, reading a passage aloud before students read independently, model fluent reading,  having students act-out the actions of the story, graphic organizers, organize your students into  reading partnerships etc. All of our students have been tested through Running Records and they  all know their independent reading levels.  Students will also receive instruction to prepare them for the NYSESLAT assessment.  The  NYSESLAT  instruction will be differentiated according to each student's individual  score.  Certified ESL/Bilingual teachers will create differentiated lessons that include the four  modalities of English Language Learners and take into consideration the various learning styles  of all students.  The school will use some of the allocated funds to pay for the two teachers,  purchase notebooks, paper, pencils, fiction and non-fiction leveled books and a more culturally  responsive library. Finish Line New York ELLs (For NYSESLAT) will be purchased and used  during the after school program.  We have found these books to be essential for NYSESLAT test  takers.  Practice lessons meet today's Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS)  and  prepare ELLs for the format and item types they will encounter during the  upcoming  NYSESLAT. We will purchase the student booklets, audio CDs and an annotated  teacher's editions for supplementation.

Our certified ENL teacher, Ms. Venice, and the Assistant Principal, Mr.  Thomas will attend most of the ENL workshops. Pedagogues and administration are encouraged  to attend professional learning sessions to enhance and deepen their knowledge of strategies to  utilize and improve the achievement of English Language Learners.  Our staff recognizes that  they are lifelong learners and welcome professional development.  When teachers attend  workshops they later turnkey the pertinent information to  the general education teachers who  have ELLs in their classes.  The information is turn keyed during monthly meetings, common  planning periods, and collaborative inquiry team meetings to discuss effective strategies for  instructing English Language Learners.   Our ENL Teachers will attend multiple professional development trainings during 2018-2019 SY  such as  Advanced Literacy 2 Day Institute and ENL Teacher Boot camp, both of which are  being offered during the summer by Brooklyn North Field Support Center.  Our ENL teachers  attended various ENL related workshops facilitated by Brooklyn North Field Support Center.  Additionally, they participated in our multiple internal TC workshops where  the TC staff  developer modeled reading and writing strategies for all students. Moreover, ongoing coaching  was provided by ENL instructional leads from the Brooklyn North Support Center.  On Mondays we provided Professional Development for all staff members, from 2:30pm- 3:40pm. Some of the professional development offered to all our teachers this past year during  this time was sessions on Co-Teaching (focusing on pushing in for ENL teachers)  "Developing  School Wide Instructional Focus & Questioning and Discussion 3B"  facilitated by Ms. Cameron  (School Principal), Guided Reading, Supporting ELLs in the Math Classrooms.  Third -fifth grade Teachers will look at NYS Exams Data to determine students strengths and  weaknesses in ELA and Math. K-2nd grade teachers will review their students' running records  to determine the types of comprehension questions their students need to review (Inference, main  idea, retell..). K-2nd grade teachers will review pre- and post Go Math exams to determine the  types of math problems they need to review and re-teach.  Additionally, the ENL teacher participated in professional learning sessions to acquire  knowledge about new research-based strategies to impact ELL students’ learning.  Furthermore,  professional meetings-inclusive of the ENL teacher and general content teachers are held to  focus on academic language and methodologies used for ELLs in the content areas. Once per  month, the ENL teacher meets with general education teachers to assist them in planning their  social studies or science lessons that target the needs of ELLs.   Thereafter, the teachers will  study and integrate the strategies in the execution of their lessons.  Differentiated tasks for ELLs  should be evident, especially in science and social studies, where the ESL teacher was rendered  assistance.  Language foci are set to make certain that students learn and write complex  sentences.  These strategies should transfer to lessons in the classroom and the after school  program.  The teachers will create assessments to decipher the effectiveness of the strategies and  make modifications in lessons and strategy meetings. During the coming SY, we will continue to  recommend and provide professional development to the ENL teachers as well as other  pedagogues who support the ELLs.  We intend to conduct more inter-visitations to sites outside  of P.S.13 to ensure best practices.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58        Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact  higher achievement for ELLs.

To make certain that all  parents of ELLs are actively involved in their children’s learning, a Back-to-School-Orientation  will be held in Sept.  A survey will be created to glean parents’ interests and concerns. Parents of  ELLs and immigrant students registered in the after school program will be invited to attend  parent workshops that address the specific needs of the children involved in the Title III  Program.  Four workshops will be held throughout the 2018-2019 school year. Each workshop  will be held for 60 minutes. The ESL teacher will facilitate and a translator will be present at the  workshops. The PTA and Parent Coordinator (Amanda Adorno) will also help facilitate parents’  involvement in these workshops.  We will notify the parents of the workshops by sending home  notices in the preferred home language, the PTA calendar, via phone calls, school messenger and  P.S. 13’s website. The workshop schedules and topics to be addressed in these Parent Workshops  are as follows:   Parents of ELLs and immigrant students who are identified for the after school program will be  notified by an ENL administrator at the end of October 2018.  The ENL teacher will give parents  an overview of the program and tips on what they can do at home to help their child succeed in  English acquisition. Interpretation will be given to parents throughout the meeting. In addition,  letters will be sent home for parental consent for students' participation, school messenger, and  P.S.13 website.  Parents will receive a report once per month to report the progress of the ELLs in the after school  program. The report will describe the skills that students should have learned and give parents  advice on how to practice these skills at home. Students' work, as well as rubrics, will be  attached to each letter showing their progress. If necessary, the letter and the rubrics will be  translated into Spanish, Arabic or Russian so that parents can have a complete picture of their  children’s performance during the Title III after  school Program.   To ensure home and school connection, the ENL teacher will contact parents via friendly  telephone calls, formal, and informal meetings with appropriate translation after school on  Tuesdays during the Parent Engagement segment. This is to build a closer relationship with  parents so the ENL teacher can have a better understanding of individual student's needs and  concerns.       We will hold our annual "Back to School Orientation" to welcome our ENL Parents and  communicate our schools vision as a whole and our vision for the Title III after school  program.  We will also create a parent survey to glean parents’ interest and concerns.    In December:  Reading Strategies – Parents whose children are in the Title III program will be  invited to this workshop, which aims to emphasize the importance of reading outside the  classroom. A Title III ENL teacher and another Title III teacher (general education/ content-area  subject) will discuss with parents the strategies they can use while reading with their children.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?        3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?         5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]        6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].        7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?               Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.      b.  TBE program.  If applicable.        c.  DL program.  If applicable.            2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA,  TCRWP, teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  To assess early literacy skills of our ELLs in kindergarten through fifth grade, we use TCRWP running records, as well as  TCRWP pre and post on demand writing for all grades and the TCRWP pre and post on demand reading assessment for grades  3-5, 4th grade Science, NYSITELL and the NYSESLAT to assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs. The raw scores of the  NYSITELL provides teachers with basic understanding of the reading, writing, speaking and listening skills for our new ELLs.  Throughout the academic year, teachers use running records to assess students’ reading levels. We administer running records  5 times throughout the year where we use TCRWP to measure their early literacy levels. In the upper grades 3 to 5, we use  Periodic Assessment for ELL, and ELA scores. These assessment tools test a variety of skills such as decoding and  comprehension as well as sight word recognition, spelling, sound-symbol relationship, reading with fluency and writing. We  use this data to analyze weakness in the skill area tested and define our learning targets and short term goals. Every spring, our  ELLs take the NYSESLAT which measures their progress in learning English as a Second Language.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    The data demonstrate a weakness in writing skills, therefore our focus is to have ELLS write expository text in which  they demonstrate the commands of the conventions of standard English.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   We use initial NYSITEL scores to identify the needs of new students. Students will be placed in classrooms with other  ELL students. ESL students will receive services from one of our ESL teachers through a a pull out and push in model. The  success of the ELL program is evaluated based on the academic and social success of the English Language Learners. Students  gain confidence in their ability to communicate in English in formal and informal settings. The program is successful if the  students have passed the NYSESLAT and/or showed significant gains on the exam. Additionally, success of the ELL program is  determined by the standardized test scores of the students. The success of the ELLs is evident at the graduation ceremony  when the honor student makes a speech about his/her first day in a new country. The goal of the school is to ensure that all  students, including the ELLs, are college and career ready .     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Students are being serviced their mandated hours throughout the day. We also have the ESL students getting  additional intervention if needed by our Academic Coach and RTI/AIS teacher.  Teachers who have these students in their class  also do small group instruction with these students throughout the school day., using ESL strategies.  We currently have an ESL  after school program for all K-5 students.  We also invite our 3-5 students to ELA/Math after school program.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  At P.S.13 we have an RTI Team and our members are: Mrs. Cameron (Principal), Ms. Archer (AIS) Ms. Towles (Special Education  Assistant Principal), Ms. Castello (Speech Teacher), Ms. Edwards (SETTS Teacher) Ms. Peralta (School Psychologist), Mr.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65      Thomas (Assistant Principal), Ms. Venice (ESL Teacher). This RTI team was formed to conduct a comprehensive needs  assessment for the ELLs and the SPEDS based on the results of the Periodic Assessment. After analyzing the data gathered  from the performance tests, period assessments, and annual tests (State examinations, and the NYSESLAT), our school  identifies ELLs who are not making academic progress at expected rates. Then we administer RTI screening to assess whether  their literacy skills and competences are meeting grade level benchmarks. For ELLs who are at risk, our ESL, classroom and  subject teachers will collaborate to design instructions to strengthen the skills they need in English language acquisition.    Differentiated materials are used to meet the needs for theses ELLs, and they are tools we use to assess their progress.  In addition, some ELLs will receive AIS service (in literacy and/or mathematics) if they are not making adequate progress in  a whole-class setting. After monitoring their progress over time (8 weeks), if these ELLs still demonstrate adequate progress  in targeted skills and competencies, we will refer them to our special education team.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      One pattern that is revealed in the NYSITELL each year is that new arrivals score at a beginning level in all modalities. As the  year progresses, the data shows that the students improve in the speaking and listening modalities. NYSESLAT 2017 , indicates  that out of 57 students tested 54 improved. Students made progress in English Language Acquisition (76.92%) and 4  students attained Proficiency on the NYSESLAT (10.26%).  For instance: In Kindergarten the new arrivals who scored beginners  on the NYSITELL in 2016-2017 made great strides on the spring NYSESLAT Test.  Results of NYSESLAT 2016-2017 SY is as follows  K- 7 Entering 0 Emerging 2 Transitioning 1 Expanding  1 st grade.- 4 Entering 0 Emerging 3 Transitioning 2 Expanding  2 nd grade - 3 Entering 4 Emerging 1 Transitioning 1 Expanding  3 rd grade - 6 Entering 2 Emerging 0 Transitioning 4 Expanding  4 th grade- 2 Entering 0 Emerging 3 Transitioning 2 Expanding  5 th grade -0 Entering 0 Emerging 0 Transitioning 0 Expanding     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We hold weekly meetings with our teachers where we share the data. In these meetings our ESL teacher is included. We have  inquiry teams by grades where our ESL teacher is an active member.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  P.S.13 has a Freestanding ESL Program. Because of our growing ELL population we decided the best way to service  our students would be through a very structured Push-In and Pull-Out ESL teaching model. There is one class in each  grade where the majority of the ESL students have been placed. For grades K-5 the ESL teacher pushes into those  classes where the majority of the ELLs are placed. She pushes in approximately 4 times per grade per week. When  needed she will bring ELLs from other classes with the same ESL Level into the class that has the majority of the ELL  students. The ESL teacher also Pulls-Out the Entering and Emerging students. The ELL groups are grouped by  proficiency level and grades         12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Paste response to questions here:        13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Paste response to questions here:        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    The organization of the staff ensures that the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to  proficiency levels in ESL. The Freestanding English as a Second Language teacher, Ms. Venice pushes-in and pulls -out all of  her ELLs. Each group receives the mandated amount of instructional minutes. As per CR Part 154, ESL and ELA instructional  minutes are explicitly delivered to the school's English Language Learners. The transitioning and expanding students receive  180 minutes of ESL ( (four periods) with Ms. Venice. Entering and emerging students receive 360 minutes (eight periods a   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66      week) of English as a Second Language instruction with Ms. Venice. The goal of the ESL program is to provide students with  sufficient English skills to grasp Common Core Standards which prepares them for college and a career. The program uses the  current identified literacy approach in the building which offers developmental sequence of English instruction in the four  language skills: listening, speaking, reading and writing. All ELLs regardless of their proficiency are provided with a minimum of  90 minutes or more of ELA instructions every day.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Our classroom and ESL teacher, have been participating in Teachers College Reading and Writing Workshop Professional  Development where they are learning strategies to scaffold their units of study for our special ed and ELL students. All of the  units of studies are aligned with the CCLS. Our classroom and ESL teacher uses the balanced literacy approach that follows  Teacher’s College Workshop Model for all ELA instruction. Social studies and Science are also part of TC units of study and ESL  instruction. Our ESL teacher collaborates with subject teachers to supplement ESL strategies in their science and social studies  lessons. Contextual support is important and comes through peer interaction, visual aids, maps, charts, graphic organizers,  and manipulative. Academic language development is also planned within each lesson to ensure the exposure of academic  language and vocabulary. Moreover, ESL methodologies (repetition, translation, visuals, etc.) are used to foster achievement  of these academic language goals. During the pull-out classes, Ms. Venice our certified ESL teacher designs literacy lessons  based on students’ needs in their content areas. During this time she uses National Geographic.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   The English Language Learners in this school are enrolled in a Freestanding English as a Second Language. They are  evaluated in English only. No instruction occurs in the children's native language.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    The school will differentiate instruction for each English Language Learner based on his/her category: SIFE, newcomer, 4-6  year ELL and long term ELL.  a)We currently only have a handfull of students identified as SIFE, the school has an educational and instructional plan to  address their needs. Students will receive a variety of academic intervention services. The ESL teacher will create an  individualized student needs assessment plan in collaboration with the AIS Team to focus on Literacy and Math skills. Students  will be provided with the corresponding English language proficiency materials to help him/her succeed in the classroom.  Additionally, the Parent Coordinator, the Guidance counselor and ICL (Institute for Community Living, a school based  community organization) will help the student and his/her parent with this transition back into a formal school setting.  b) ELLs who have recently arrived to the United States of America will receive instruction tailored to fit their academic and  social needs. All teachers servicing ELLs will differentiate instruction according to the results of NYS standardized exams,  LAB-R, NYSESLAT, and informal teacher observation and assessments. Using a buddy system, the teacher will identify a similar  student in his/her class to assist them during the day. Students are encouraged to participate in afterschool program. An  informal assessment is provided to identify possible Academic Intervention programs. Each ELL will complete assignments in  English at their own pace using computer programs such as Waterford, Destination Reading and Ticket to Read. All instruction  focuses on the four modalities; listening, speaking, reading and writing.  c)Ms. Venice and the AIS team will collect and analyze data concerning the ELLs receiving four to six years of ESL services. The  group will scrutinize the results of the NYSESLAT, ELA and Math assessments to highlight academic strengths and weaknesses.  The team will create an action plan for each student delineating and tabulating the standards, concepts and skills that have  not been grasped. Instruction and assignments in English will focus on the action plan. Students will be reevaluated every six  weeks to track progress in these areas.  d)While we do not currently have any long-term ELLs, in case the school receives such students during the academic year,  these students will participate in a targeted specific afterschool program. The afterschool program will focus on reading and  writing through drama, computer, art, and science. Additionally, Ticket to Read, and Go Math to support all of our ELL  students.  e) The plan for continuing transitional support for students reaching the NYSESLAT is that they are entitled to receive an  additional year of ESL services upon request from their parents/ guardians. Mrs. Cameron (Principal), Ms. Joseph (Speech   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67         Teacher) Ms. Archer (AIS Teacher) Ms. Towles (Special Education Assistant Principal), Ms. Edwards (SETTS Teacher) Ms.  Graham (School Psychologist), Ms. Brown (ESL/AIS Assistant Principal), Ms. Venice (ESL Teacher). This RTI team was formed  to conduct a comprehensive needs assessment for the ELLs and the SPEDS based on the results of the Periodic Assessment.  After analyzing the data gathered from the performance tests, period assessments, and annual tests (State examinations, and  the NYSESLAT), our school identifies ELLs who are not making academic progress at expected rates. Then we administer RTI  screening to assess whether their literacy skills and competences are meeting grade level benchmarks. For ELLs who are at  risk, our ESL, classroom and subject teachers will collaborate to design instructions to strengthen the skills they need in English  language acquisition. Differentiated materials are used to meet the needs for theses ELLs, and they are tools we use to assess  their progress. In addition, some ELLs will receive AIS service (in literacy and/or mathematic) if they are not making adequate  progress in a whole-class setting. After monitoring their progress over time (8 weeks), if these ELLs still demonstrate adequate  progress in targeted skills and competencies, we will refer them to our special education team. For classes that the ESL  teacher pushes in or co-teaches, that ESL teacher provides necessary supports for the former ELLs. As to testing, they will  receive the same testing modifications as all other ELLs for two years after they pass the NYSESLAT. They can also participate  in the ELA after school classes to maintain and enhance their English levels. In addition, classroom and subject teachers meet  with our ESL teachers regularly to discuss concerns and strategies for these students.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Some of the research-based and standards-based instructional methods for English Language Learners  are helpful when  working with Students with Disabilities. Teachers of ELLs with disabilities have a variety of programs to  help their students  access academic content areas and accelerate English Language development. The school's literacy  curriculum, TC Reading  and Writing Workshop, has a component for English Language Learners and the ESL teacher has attended  several workshops.  To strengthen all of our students reading and writing skills we implemented the Wilson Fundations for K- 3 a  phonological/phonemic awareness prevention program . These students are exposed to the content and  concept many times  using a myriad of instructional methods. The teacher uses visual aids, graphic organizers, repetition,  simple language,  scaffolded vocabulary and the audio concept of the literacy program.     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The school uses curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to meet the diverse needs of ELL-SWDs within the least  restrictive environment. The ELL-SWD students are pulled out with the other ESL students who are on the same grade and on  the same proficiency level. Currently we have nine ELL-SWDs students both the ELS teacher and the Classroom teacher   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68         adhere to the child’s IEP goals. Since classroom, special education and our ESL teachers collaborate to design lessons,  ELL-SWDs are provided with additional modifications specific to their IEPs and identified needs. Meanwhile, our ESL, special  education and regular education teachers meet regularly to discuss and implement ESL strategies to accelerate students’  English language acquisition. Our ESL teachers also take part in IEP meetings in order to have a throughout understanding of  the needs of ELL-SWDs.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Our school provides Academic Intervention Services which includes Math, Reading and Technology: For instance, GoMath for  math implementation and supplement with UMathX program to support student learning and increase student outcomes.  Also implement TC units of study which are alighed with the CCLS and students are exposed to a range of non-fictional reading  and writing in the content areas (Science and Social Studies). Most of our ESL students with IEP's are in Integrated  Co-Teaching classroom with two classroom teachers. Tier I ELA interventions is monitored by classroom teachers. Teachers  provide them with small group support and various materials such as Achieve 3000, Reday Gen Phonemic/Word Study and  Building Vocabulary are used to enhance students' English levels. Tier II ELA intervention is provided by academic intervention  teacher Ms. Davis. For AIS students are pulled out in small groups or individually for 20-30 minutes a day to work on their  fluency, decoding and coding and comprehension skills using The Waterford Early Reading Literacy, Math and Science  program.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      The school employs a variety of data and methodologies to assess the written translation and oral interpretation  needs of the parents in the school community. Staff members are surveyed on their written and oral skills in  languages other than English. The home languages of the students and parents are identified during the  registration process via the Home Language Identification Survey and the interview process where parents are  given the Parents' Preferred Language form and they indicate what language they preferred to be communicated  in. All written correspondence are sent home with students in the parents' native language (If indicated in the  Parents' Preferred Language Form).

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      We currently have an automated message system that calls, text or emails parents with any announcements from the  school. We would contact the DOE’s translation team and have them record the emergency message in the languages  that have been listed previously. For those parents who prefer to receive the text or email then the message will be  translated by one our community language helpers.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          82     Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      We will hold a PD in September to let all staff members know about all the resources available to the teachers,  parents and students regarding translations. During the September curriculum night we will let parents know of the  services the school can provide to Limited English Speaking parents.           Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      According to Chancellor's Regulations A-663, the school must ensure that non English speaking parents have equal  access and opportunity to participate fully in their child's education. All correspondence is sent home to parents in  their native language and English. In-house interpretation is available in all languages except Arabic, however, in the  event that the school receives new students from an Arabic speaking country with monolingual parents the school will  contact the Translation and Interpretation Unit. The Arabic -speaking business owners have offered to help translate  and interpret for other families if needed. The Arabic speaking parents (fathers) have opted out of receiving assistance  from the Department of Education's Translation and Interpretation Unit. The school continues to ask these parents if  they need an interpreter before each meeting and they continue to inform us that it is not necessary. The school has  clear procedures for determining the home language of each student. Upon registration, parents complete the Home  Language Identification Survey, indicating their native language. If the student speaks another language besides  English at home, then Ms. Venice, the ESL teacher administers the NYSETELL exam. Even though the student passes  the exam, indicating that he/she is fluent in English, the school still sends correspondence home in the parent's native  language. The school ensures that parents are provided with both written and interpretation services in their native  language.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       Currently our principal, Ms. Cameron, has implemented monthly meetings with the parents (Breakfast with the  Principal). During these meetings parents are free to voice any opinions, ideas or issues they may have. Limited  English Parents are welcome to come to these meetings and translators will be provided so they may voice any  questions or concerns they are currently having. We will also implement parent surveys in the parents preferred  language to ensure all voices are heard.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          83
