This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Mott Hall III prepares students to become responsible citizens and future leaders in mathematics, science, technology  and the humanities. We strive to create a community of learners who not only love to learn, but who have the  knowledge base to do so.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Prospective students go through an interview process to attend Mott Hall III and attend our summer orientation  program, both of which convey our high expectations for students. At Mott Hall III, we know that if our students are  going to be tomorrow’s leaders, it is not enough for them to pass their state tests. They must go beyond the  standards if they are going to lead.       Mott Hall III is organized into grade and subject level teams that meet on a regular basis. During these meetings,  teachers work on collaborative planning and professional development, facilitated by teacher leaders and  administrators. In these meetings, our teachers collaborate with colleagues for student success. They examine  formative and summative assessment data to share strategies and develop action plans around instruction and  individualized student support. In department teams, teachers collaborate to set goals that are aligned with school- wide goals for student achievement and progress. Teachers meet with administrators to share their individual goals  for students at the beginning of the year and at key benchmarks throughout the year. Teachers also facilitate the  development of specific and measurable goal-setting among their students.      We are in our fourth year of implementing the DOE-recommended curricula of Expeditionary Learning in ELA. In  Math, we are in our second year of implementing the EngageNY curriculum in September 2016. Teachers use the  modules and resources from this curriculum flexibly, with the needs of their students in mind and with ongoing  assessment data informing their instruction. Over the last three years, administrators have worked with department  teams to develop Planning Guides for each subject. These planning guides establish coherent practices for curriculum  planning, assessment, and progress tracking to inform their instruction. While the Curriculum Map and Unit Plan  templates are used by teachers throughout the school, each department also has developed lesson plan templates for  use by all subject teachers. Teachers consulted the Danielson Framework for Teaching to develop thee lesson plans,  emphasizing student time on task and with specific areas for planning higher-order questions, and strategies to meet  student needs.      Teachers use rubrics, student reflections, and portfolios throughout the curriculum, and our annual Science Expo and  twice-yearly Curriculum Expos nurture our culture of student accountability and quality work. Student excellence is  celebrated in regular awards assemblies and monthly incentives. Our annual Career Day allows us to reinforce our  high expectations of students and expose them to professional and academic opportunities beyond their experience.  Academic Intervention Services are provided for struggling students during class through differentiated activities and  during our after school program for ELA and Math.      In addition to a quality, standards-based academic curriculum, Mott Hall III offers students a variety of enrichment  opportunities both during the school day and after school. Our Mott Hall III Schoolwide Enrichment Clusters include  dance, chorus, MH3 Rockstars, and Baker’s Delight. After school, our offerings include dance, basketball, art club,  softball, baseball, and Specialized High School Preparation. We also pride ourselves on our one-to-one computer-to- student ratio at Mott Hall III. All classrooms are equipped with Smartboards, all teachers sign up to use our state-of- the-art computer lab with their classes, and all classrooms have easy access to laptop carts to maximize technology  integration in the classroom.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Our student population includes 15% of students with Individualized Educational Plans and 5% English Language  Learners. We have an Integrated Co-Teaching (ICT) classroom on each grade and two self-contained special education  classrooms. Special education teachers, both in ICT and self-contained roles, have planning meetings weekly with  regular education ELA and Math teachers to plan collaboratively, differentiate, and adapt the curriculum to support  students with IEPs to meet subject-area standards. Students in self-contained classrooms have individualized, flexible  schedules in which they “push-in” to ICT classes where appropriate, including art, physical education, social studies,  and others. English Language Learners receive support from the school’s ENL teacher using a push-in model during  ELA classes. The ENL teacher meets weekly with members of the ELA department to plan instruction and make  modifications to support ELL students’ acquisition of academic vocabulary and content area reading.         4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Because of our rich and rigorous curriculum, our commitment of offering all students access to that curriculum, our  systems for maintaining high expectations for all students, and our variety of high-quality enrichment opportunities,  we consider “Rigorous Instruction,” “Supportive Environment,” and “Collaborative Teachers” to be our strongest  elements from the elements that comprise the Framework for Great Schools . In her Quality Review Report, the  reviewer highlighted these features by rating our school “Well Developed” in Quality Review indicators 1.1, 3.4, and  4.2 when she visited our school in November 2014. She cited Indicator 1.1, which pertains to engaging, rigorous, and  coherent curricula in all subjects, as an “Area of Celebration,” writing, “The school’s curriculum builds coherence  across grades and subject areas and promotes college and career readiness for all students.” In the spring of 2018, our  school achieved significant gains on state tests, with 60% of our students achieving proficiency on the NYS ELA Exam,  an increase in 17 percentage points, and 52% of our students achieving proficiency on the NYS Math Exam, an  increase in 7 percentage points from last year. We attribute these gains to our overwhelming strengths in the areas of  "Rigorous Instruction," "Supportive Environment," and "Collaborative Teachers." We have made strides in all three of  these areas of the Framework over the past four years, ensuring curricular alignment to the Common Core Standards,  developing systems to support our positive school environment, and engaging all teachers in the inquiry process  during our expanded professional learning time.    We hope to build on these strengths to focus on the other two elements from the Framework: School Leadership and  School-Community Ties. This year, we have formalized the roles and functions of teacher leaders to improve  communication and coherence across all teams. We now have three DOE Peer Collaborative Teachers to provide  ongoing mentoring to all first- and second-year teachers. Next year, we plan to continue our progress in this area by  implementing ongoing cycles of Teacher Rounds, coordinate professional learning among all Peer Collaborative  Teachers and department leaders, and implementing standardized protocols for professional learning activities such  as looking at student work. In addition, our new parent coordinator, in collaboration with our Community  Coordinator, Admin Team, and faculty, has made great strides in enhancing our school's performance in the area of  “School-Community Ties.” In the upcoming year, we seek to build upon our parent engagement activities and  continue to maximize parents' opportunities to engage with their children’s educational experiences during the school  day.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 09X128   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   363   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     As stated in our “CEP Overview,” the area of Rigorous Curriculum represents a strength for our school. Our Quality  Reviewer highlighted this area in her report as an Area of Celebration. She described her observations of high-level  tasks, classroom discussions, rigorous investigations, and argumentative writing assessments throughout the  curriculum. She also cited the Planning Guides that have been developed by administrators and department teams to  establish coherent practices for curriculum planning, assessment, and progress tracking among all teachers. These  strengths in the area of rigorous instruction may contribute to the fact that our students regularly perform on par  with, or outperform, their peers on statewide assessments throughout the city and state. It also explains why 97% of  parents responded that they were satisfied with the education their children received on the 2018 NYC School Survey.   While we take pride in our accomplishments in the area of Rigorous Curriculum, we also consistently examine our  data to set goals for academic improvements. In the 2017-18 school year, 60% of students achieved a Level 3 and 4 on  the New York State ELA Exam. This percentage of students meeting proficiency increased from 43% during the  previous year. The data shows that we must continue key initiatives to push our students to make individual progress  toward rigorous learning goals using an assessment-driven and engaging curriculum. We must also ensure that we  implement the Expeditionary Learning curriculum in a way that aligns to the goals of the standards, so that students  are prepared to demonstrate proficiency on the 2019 ELA Exam.    In the 2017-18 school year, 52% of students achieved a Level 3 and 4 on the New York State Math Exam. This  percentage of students meeting proficiency increased from 45% during the previous year. This data shows that we  must continue key initiatives to push our students to make individual progress toward rigorous learning goals using an  assessment-driven and engaging curriculum. We must also maximize our learning around the EngageNY Math  curriculum, including maximum teacher participation in the NYC DOE's Algebra for All initiative and District 9's  Teacher Rounds and Five Practices in Math initiatives, so that students are prepared to demonstrate proficiency on  the 2019 Math Exam and master Algebra in their eighth or ninth grade years.    This year, we would like to track and monitor growth in a subgroup of our student population: those students  performing in the lowest third citywide on NYS ELA and Math exams. While our students as a whole demonstrate  gains in their state standardized test performance as they move from sixth to eighth grade, these gains are not shared  by all students at our school. Specifically, students performing in the lowest third citywide on the NYS ELA exam  experienced an average change in -3% in proficiency from spring 2016 to spring 2017. Students performing in the  lowest third citywide on the NYS Math exam experienced an average change of -4% in proficiency from spring 2016 to  spring 2017. This data drives us to develop systems for identifying, tracking, and providing ongoing support to this  subgroup of students across all subject areas. With ongoing data monitoring and intervention, we aim to ensure that  students in this subgroup experience significant progress throughout their years at our school.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13       Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   By May 2019, Mott Hall III students performing in the lowest third citywide will experience a 5% growth in their  proficiency ratings, as measured by 2019 New York State ELA and Math exams.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional  development, and/or systems and structures needed  to impact change.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  Our school maintains a supportive environment through several features: our personalized, whole-child approach; our  emphasis on collaboration in planning and teaching; our ongoing parent engagement events that unite our  community for our students' success. All students receive weekly lessons in organization, goal-setting, reflection, and  other skills for success during our weekly Advisory period. Every week, each student receives a Weekly Progress  Report that details students' behavior and academic performance from that week. Teachers log on to this  computerized system and record student behavior and grade information for their students through the course of the  week. Students receive these reports on Fridays and return them, with their parents' signatures, on Monday  mornings. The Weekly Progress Report captures all elements of exemplary scholarship, including strong attendance,  positive behavior, and high classroom grades. The system tracks student performance in these areas with a weekly  "score," called a PSI, that qualifies students for incentives and special events throughout the year.      Though our school prides itself on our robust, healthy culture, our review of relevant data reveals a troubling trend:  an increase in incidences of suicidal ideation and attempted among Mott Hall III students. Such incidences numbered  only 5 in school year 2015-16, and spiked in school year 2016-17 to 16. In school year 2017-18, there were 11 such  incidences. Through a coordinated effort involving all stakeholders, we aim to reduce this figure by 40% this year.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   From its inception, Mott Hall III has been a school built upon collaboration among teachers. Teachers are organized  into a variety of teams throughout the school and collaborate to ensure student success. From formalized mentoring  relationships and structured grade and department teams, to informal collegial support offered among all teachers,  our teachers support one another in every aspect of their practice. Teachers’ commitment to collaboration is revealed  in their responses on the 2018 NYC School Survey: 92% of teachers agreed with the statements, "The principal,  teachers, and staff collaborate to make this school run effectively." In addition to these statements, 100% of teachers  say that they talk with one another about instruction, 100% of teachers say that they design instructional programs  (for example, lessons and units) together, and 100% of teachers say that teachers help maintain discipline in the  entire school, not just their classroom. These statistics help to explain why our school received a 4.64 score in the area  of Collaborative Teachers on our 2018 School Quality Guide, which was higher than the district average by +1.13 and  higher from the city average by +.96.   This year, we engaged two teachers in the District 9 Teacher Rounds initiative. These teachers met with their  mentoring school monthly, attended ongoing professional development sessions, and engaged a team to conduct  Teacher Rounds at the school. In May, these teachers joined our principal in attending a professional development  session dedicated to Teacher Rounds at Harvard University. These teachers applied for and were awarded Peer  Collaborative Teacher status at the conclusion of this school year. They began their work at our June Chancellor's  Conference Day, when they engaged our staff in professional learning on the concept of teacher collaboration,  presented an overview of the Teacher Rounds process, and solicited faculty members in signing up for next year's  Teacher Rounds teams.   With this groundwork established, we will be able to begin our work at full strength in Teacher Rounds at the  beginning of next year. Twelve faculty members have enrolled in the initiative, which will take place during  professional learning time on Tuesday afternoons. In addition, we will continue to work with department leaders to  implement protocols for discussing professional literature, analyzing data, and looking at student work to set  instructional next steps.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Many of our school’s strengths in the area of distributive school leadership are grounded in our school’s history. Our  founding principal, Jorisis Stupart, worked as a teacher at a different District 9 school before founding Mott Hall III  with a vision of creating a nurturing, rigorous educational experience for children. Ms. Stupart enlisted several teacher  leaders at her school to join her in her endeavor, and this core group spent hours developing and refining systems  that are still in use at our school today. Our organization continues to value teacher leadership, and to incorporate  systems for leadership into every aspect of the school’s daily operations. Members of each grade team meet weekly  in meetings that are facilitated by the supervisory administrator and a member of the team who acts as grade team  leader. These team leaders serve as communication liaisons among all members of the team, and they help to  coordinate grade-wide initiatives such as trips and student interventions. Subject department teams also meet  regularly. These team meetings are facilitated by teacher leaders with the support of administrators. Teachers also  serve in leadership roles within professional learning groups; these roles include meeting facilitators and recorders,  who update professional learning groups’ progress on Google Docs shared with the entire school community.   Our school’s teacher leaders operate in a variety of roles. Over the last year, we have developed stronger  communication and consistency among practices with our team leaders through convening weekly Team Leader  meetings. This communication and consistency has helped to ensure coherence in our work and maximize the  effectiveness of all teams. Next year, we will enhance our professional learning opportunities through coordination  with our Peer Collaborative Teachers. These teachers will work with department leaders and teachers to engage in  ongoing professional learning for improved teacher practice.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Over the last fifteen years of its existence, our school has worked to develop, refine, and maintain a number of  systems and events that engage parents, enrich the civic life of the school, and support student achievement. Our  gradebook system is updated regularly by teachers. Using a unique username and password, parents can log in to the  system to check their children’s grades and intervene to address issues before the marking period ends. Every Friday,  students receive progress reports, which are also maintained through an online system. Teachers make comments on  student progress reports regarding student behavior and academic progress during the week; students return their  progress reports, with their parents’ signatures, the following Monday. Our student handbook, which every student  receives at the beginning of the year, lists the email addresses and phone numbers for every teacher and staff  member at the school. Students also receive the school calendar, which lists a variety of family events that engage  parents and celebrate students throughout the year. These events include Family Day, held as the final day of our  Student Orientation week, and celebratory performances and gatherings in honor of Hispanic Heritage Month, Black  History Month, and Mother’s Day. These events are hallmarks for our school community. All stakeholders look  forward to them each year. They serve to draw new families into our Mott Hall III family, and to tighten our bond with  the families of our older students.   These schoolwide systems and events may contribute to the positive responses our parents make on the NYC School  Survey every year. In 2018, 96% of parents agreed with the statement, “I feel respected by my child's teachers.”   Next year, we plan to continue our strong performance in the areas of Family and Community Ties and further  develop opportunities for parents to stay informed and participate in events inside and outside of the school day.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and  Time-bound.

N/A        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     The structure that we use to ensure that teachers participate in the decision-making process are department  meetings which meet regularly during professional learning time. Each spring, teachers meet in departments to  evaluate the effectiveness of the NYC Periodic Assessments used in the previous school year. Then, they assess the  options available in the coming year and they make selections for the assessment package they prefer. At four points  during the year, administrators meet with teachers to review assessment data during Data Conversations. During  these conversations, teachers and administrators discuss action plans to address the major learning needs suggested  by the assessment data. Teachers also use this formative data during their weekly planning meetings to inform their  instruction.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43           Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. 09X128, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      Mott Hall III will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.     In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Elementary and Secondary Education (ESSA) Act;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.            School-Parent Compact (SPC)      School-Parent Compact (SPC)   09X128, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is  implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between  the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I,  agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for  improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure  that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47            Provide high quality curriculum and instruction consistent with Common Core State Standards to enable participating  children to meet the State’s Standards and Assessments by:   I.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  We use the Scantron Performance Series assessments to assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs. Most of our ELL students  fall between the 500L-900L range. Data from these assessments show that the majority of our ELLs are reading 2-3 levels  below grade level. This data has informed the schedule and strategies that our ESL teacher uses to support the ELLs at our  school. Mr. Hull's schedule allows him to co-teach in 6th, 7th, and 8th grade ELA classes, where skills from the Common Core  Standards are emphasized, and to support his students' development and comprehension in those content areas. He also uses  the data to inform him of which instructional strategies would best improve a student's comprehension of the content  including text chunking, pre-teaching and modeling. In 2017, 88% of the ELL population scored Expanding on the NYSESLAT;  the remaining 22% scored at the Transitioning level. For this reason, the majority of supports are provided in an integrated  classroom. Common planning time shared with ELA teachers from 6th, 7th, and 8th grade gives Mr. Hull the ability to keep up  to date with each of his co-teachers. Curriculum maps, unit plans, and lesson plans are all uploaded to Google Drive and  shared with the entire staff. Unit plans contain the standard, text, and task for each lesson. This year, 35% have an IEP and 47%   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         are classified as Long-Term ELLs. Students with an IEP are given the supports listed in their IEP. Long-Term ELLs' writing and  reading are tracked via writing samples and reading tests administered throughout the year.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Common planning time with core subject teachers and ESL teacher.  Grade team meetings.  Curriculum maps, unit plans, and lesson plans uploaded to Google Drive staff folders organized by subject and grade.  Unit plans list standard, text, and task for each lesson.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We evaluate our success by disaggregating data from school-wide NYS ELA and math assessments to determine the  performance and progress of our ELL students as it compares with that of the student body as a whole. We examine our state  report card to determine if we have met AYP for our ELLs. Additionally, we administer writing, reading, and grammar  diagnostics in the first two months of the school year to identify areas of need and potential focuses for small group  instruction. Progress is measured through benchmark assessments administered in January and a summative assessment  administered before the NYSESLAT in April. ELL students attend an after-school test preparation program where the data  collected from the diagnostic and benchmark assessments are used to inform instruction further. We also track student  performance and progress on the NYSESLAT each year to evaluate the success of our programs for ELLs. Our students tend to  score highest on Reading and Speaking while Listening and Writing lag behind. We are meeting our ESSA targets for ELLs.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Students are grouped in class according to results acquired in summative assessments. Once in groups, students are taught via  the various co-teaching models during integrated ENL time.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The data patterns across proficiency levels on the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT and grades demonstrate that many of our students  perform higher in reading and/or speaking skills than they do on listening and writing. Therefore, much of the instructional  support that our teachers offer to our English Language Learners is focused on scaffolding for listening to take notes  and writing cohesive essays. In order to maintain the current level of performance in reading, we continue to scaffold for  reading complex texts and giving students opportunities to present to their classmates as a means of practicing all four  modalities.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Weekly planning and grade team meetings between administrators, core subject teachers, and ESL teacher take place. These  meetings are used to discuss a range of topics but are always data-driven. The majority of our data is stored in Google Drive on  several Google Sheets, including an 'ELL Students' Google Sheet which stores up to date data on our current and former ELLs.  By containing this data in a comprehensive spreadsheet, laid out in several tabs, it can be easily sorted to meet the needs of a  given meeting. Much of this data comes from the EDAT, however, the EDAT is too large a file to serve as a day-to-day tool.  Rather, it is used as a monthly reference to ensure that our spreadsheets are up to date.           Part IV: ELL Programming    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   ENL instruction is delivered using the integrated co-teaching model with two certified teachers (content area teacher  and ENL teacher). During integrated instruction, teachers collaborate, instruct, and assess the progress of the ELLs and  other students. Our ELLs are in block classes of nearly homogeneous proficiency. The benefit of this ENL methodology  is that it enhances students' skills in the four modalities -- listening, speaking, reading, and writing -- while not  disrupting the students' access to daily classroom instruction. The ENL teacher differentiates learning tasks and  materials and provides a variety of verbal and non-verbal supports. We have stand-alone ENL for our 2 students at the  transitioning level as per CR 154.2. These students are pulled from their ELA skills period on Thursdays and Fridays,  where they receive the same lesson with a variety of language supports.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              At Mott Hall III, students present a range of proficiencies from emerging to expanding ability levels. The ESL teacher's  program is structured in a way that all students receive their mandated instruction. In order to do this, our ELL students are  placed in specific classes on each grade level according to their proficiency levels. To devise the ENL teacher's co-teaching  schedule, we use the class schedule of those specific homerooms and prioritize his presence in content area classes. The ENL  teacher also has an Advisory and Talent Period class, during which time he works with ELL students. All transitioning and  expanding students receive 90 minutes of ENL/ELA and 90 minutes of integrated content/ENL instruction per week. Our  commanding students receive 90 minutes of integrated content/ENL per week. We do not have any entering or  emerging ELLs.         3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      All ENL instruction is provided in English. Mr. Hull co-teaches content area classes to differentiate learning tasks, provide  supplemental materials, and conduct small group conferences to support them in meeting the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards. His supports include but are not limited to text chunking, kwl charts, cloze procedures, and context  enhanced access points (modeling). If students are proficient in their L1 Mr. Hull provides native language support through  translated text, cognate vocabulary lists, and native language student pairing.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   Upon their admission to Mott Hall III, parents of ELL students are given the HLIS and provided with informational materials and  meetings. These meetings serve as the first level in ensuring that ELL students are identified to receive ENL services.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.   Long Term   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      e.   Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a. We currently do not have any SIFE students enrolled at our school.   b. The two students who have been in US schools less than three years span a range of NYSESLAT proficiency levels and include  students in grades 6-8. These students receive services from our ENL teacher, Mr. Hull, who pushes into content area and  English Language Arts classes for the number of minutes that is required by their ELL status. Mr. Hull uses instructional  strategies and materials such as bilingual glossaries, chunking and annotating of texts, teacher think-alouds, small-group  conferences, and facilitation of collaborative work with peers to support our newcomers' development. Our newcomers are  also in Mr. Hull’s Advisory class, which meets once a week for 55 minutes. During this time, Mr. Hull conducts individualized  conferences with students about their academic and behavioral progress. He also conducts lessons in topics such as self- esteem, teamwork and leadership, and habits for personal success.  c. The 14 students who are receiving service from 4-6 years span a range of proficiency levels and include students in grades 6- 8. These students receive services from our ENL teacher, Mr. Hull, who pushes into content area and English Language Arts  classes for the number of minutes that is required by their ELL status. Mr. Hull uses instructional strategies and materials such  as books on tape, chunking and annotating of texts, teacher think-alouds, small-group conferences, and facilitation of  collaborative work with peers to support our long-term ELLs' development. Our ELLs receiving service from 4-6 years are also  in Mr. Hull's Advisory class. During this time, Mr. Hull conducts individualized conferences with students about their academic  and behavioral progress. He also conducts lessons in topics such as self-esteem, teamwork and leadership, and habits for  personal success.  d. The ten students who are designated long-term ELLs include students in grades 6-8. These students receive services from  our NYS-certified teacher, Mr. Hull, who pushes into content area and English Language Arts classes for the number of minutes  that is required by their ELL status. Mr. Hull uses instructional strategies and materials such as books on tape, chunking and  annotating of texts, teacher think-alouds, small-group conferences, and facilitation of collaborative work with peers to support  our long-term ELLs' development. Our long-term ELLs are also in Mr. Hull's Advisory class. During this time, Mr. Hull conducts  individualized conferences with students about their academic and behavioral progress. He also conducts lessons in topics  such as self-esteem, teamwork and leadership, and habits for personal success.  e. All former ELLs are identified for targeted assessment monitoring throughout the school year. All teachers are trained in  supporting the needs of ELL learners, and they use these strategies for current and former ELLs alike. All faculty members also  engage in data analysis of student achievement data, disaggregated by ELL and Former-ELL status, to monitor the progress of  these students throughout the year. Former ELLs participate in our AIS afterschool program on Wednesday and Thursday  afternoons for one hour and 15 minutes each session. These afterschool sessions are taught by NYS certified ELA and Math  teachers.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   The instructional strategies and grade-level materials that teachers of ELL-SWDs use include teacher read aloud and think- alouds, reading partners, books on tape, chunking and annotating of texts, small group conferences, and facilitation of  collaborative work with peers. Materials and choice of scaffolding address both content and language learning while also being  formatted specifically for each ELL-SWD disability. For example ELL-SWD are often pre-taught both content area Tier 3  vocabulary and everyday Tier 1 and 2 vocabulary before reading assignments.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Mott Hall III offers a SETSS, an ICT and a self-contained class for ELL-SWDs. ELL-SWDs are placed into the least restrictive  environment based on their IEPs. Students are able to interact with non-ELL peers within their classroom. The ENL teacher  schedule allows for him to co-teach in the content areas that each group of ELL-SWDs shows the most academic need based  on formal and informal assessments. For the SC ELL-SWDs it is ELA. Stand-alone ENL for lower proficiency students also follows  the guidelines and class size outlined in each ELL-SWDs IEP.         8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      We offer an after-school AIS program on Wednesday and Thursday afternoons.  These programs target all of our ELLs, and they  are offered in English-only. We use informal assessment during the program and formal assessment during the school day to  track the gains made by ELLs in a way to measure the effectiveness of the program. Our Long-Term ELL students are also  invited to participate in an ENL after-school program provided by Mr. Hull which begins in October. Lastly, Mr. Hull teaches a  stand-alone ENL class first period on Thursday mornings in which all eight Long-Term ELLs are enrolled.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      We feel that our current intergrated co-teaching (two qualified teachers, content and ESL) model is effective, and we will not  be considering new programs or improvements for the upcoming school year.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We feel that our current programs and services are effective and will not be discontinued.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs, as they are integrated seamlessly into all school programs and  activities.  These school programs include regular classroom instruction with push-in support from our ENL teacher, as well as  afterschool AIS programs.   During all family events, Spanish oral interpretation services are available. We also utilize the  services of the NY Translation & Interpretation Unit when necessary. The majority of parents choose English as their preferred  language of communication.    Supplemental Programs for ELLs Include:  Monday - ELL-only Advisory Period w/ Mr. Hull to debrief on the week's issues and strategize solutions for common problems.  Wednesday - After school ENL program open to all ELLs, designed to target LTELLs by using a variety of mediums to assess  growth (final projects can include speeches, PowerPoint presentations, essays, etc.)  Thursday - ENL Class aimed at LTELLs. The class takes place during 'talent period' and is titled "Nature's Fury." Tasks are  designed around the 8th grade NY State science scope and sequence.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  The instructional materials that are used to support ELLs include Smartboard interactive lessons in every subject; complex  texts, including primary and secondary sources, informational texts in science and social studies, and nonfiction and trade  book novels in ELA; internet research; graphic organizers; mathematics manipulatives; flash cards to support vocabulary  development in each subject; and guided reading and readers' theater materials.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   When asked students receive native language support through translated materials, the use of bilingual glossaries, ENL literacy  strategies for students that are aligned with the ELA/content area curriculum (BICS and CALP), and the use of an L1 buddy  system. However, our program is English-only.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All services and materials are grade and age appropriate. Mott Hall III offers a SETSS, an ICT and a self-contained class for ELL- SWDs. ELL-SWDs are placed into the least restrictive environment based on their IEPs and given materials appropriate for their  level. Mr. Hull also uses the NLAP to inform his instruction during ENL class and after school and elaborated on this resource  with his colleagues during a professional development.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    The instructional materials that are used to support ELLs include Smartboard interactive lessons in every subject; complex  texts, including primary and secondary sources, informational texts in science and social studies, and non-fiction and trade  book novels in ELA; internet research; graphic organizers; mathematics manipulatives; flash cards to support vocabulary  development in each subject; and guided reading and readers' theater materials.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57         16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   We hold a student orientation a week before the beginning of the school year. Students are introduced to their new school,  teachers, fellow classmates, and the expectations of the curriculum. We also have a parent meeting on Curriculum Night to  better familiarize the parents with our school and programs. When our ELLs enroll in our school throughout the school year,  our ENL teacher, Mr. Hull, calls parents to familiarize them with our school programs and policies, and he meets with families  when necessary. All ELL students are assigned Mr. Hull’s weekly Advisory class, where they receive individualized check-in  meetings about their academic and behavioral progress and learn lessons about habits for success.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    At this time we do not offer language electives to ELLs.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A           Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Our ESL teacher, Mr. Hull, attends professional development workshops held by the Department of Education and Borough  Field Support Center. He turnkeys this professional development to all teachers of ELLs during weekly professional  development sessions, held on Mondays and Tuesdays during Professional Learning time and on Chancellor’s Conference  Days.  He also participates in both grade team meetings and planning meetings, in which the academic and social/emotional  needs of ELLs is discussed. Recent ELL PD topics include information on second language acquisition and analyzing NYSESLAT  scores.   Our schoolwide professional learning time takes place on Monday and Tuesday afternoons.  As part of our PD plan, Mr.  Hull leads workshops to all teachers on strategies for supporting the achievement of ELL students. Additional PD topics have  included: an examination of ELA and Math achievement data disaggregated by ELL status, and planning for next steps; a  discussion of the instructional shifts demanded by the Common Core Learning Standards, and how they are reflected in our  curriculum maps, unit plans, and lessons; professional learning on facilitating students' close reading of complex texts,  especially in the content areas; steps to improve differentiation for ELLs using the New Language Arts Progressions (NLAP); and  the use of a protocol for looking at student work in grade teams to determine next steps for ELL students.      2017-18 Professional Development Schedule and Topics:     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         Our teachers are given curriculum and professional development support in implementing an Advisory program to assist  students, including ELLs, as they transition from elementary to middle school.  Our Advisory classes meet once a week; during  that time, teachers check in with small groups of students on their academic and behavioral progress, based on data from their  grade and behavior progress reports; these Advisories also explore topics such as self-esteem, conflict management, and  habits for success.  As part of their professional development, faculty advisers are trained to contact homes of their advises to  introduce themselves, clarify expectations, and inquire about students' prior school experiences and goals for the year. Mr.  Hull, our ENL teacher, is an adviser for all of our ELL students in grades 6-8. Our guidance counselor, Ms. Jennifer Simon,  receives professional development on ELL topics during school wide PD.  As stated above,  Mr. Hull presents information about meeting the needs of our ELLs during professional learning time on  Monday and Tuesday afternoons.  He participates in weekly team and planning meetings led by administrators and teachers of  ELLs.  At these planning meetings, teachers collaborate to plan strategies for differentiation and skill development among ELL  learners.  They also look at recent student data, disaggregated by ELL status, to assess progress and plan next steps. Mr.  Hull uses these meetings to turnkey information that he receives from outside workshops. Finally, all of our teachers are  invited to attend workshops offered through the Department of Education and our Borough Field Support Center. Teachers  track their professional development hours by keeping track of the agendas and through a tracker provided by the UFT.            Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   All parents are invited by Mr. Hull to attend an ENL orientation in early October, where translation services are provided.  Spanish and French-speaking staff members translate for parents, while the Translation & Interpretation Services line is used  for those who need it. Parents are invited to review the levels of proficiency and to compare their child's level to the  Commanding score. Annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs are be scheduled throughout the year. These meetings  are logged in the 'ELL Students' Google Sheet referenced above. All efforts will be made to have all the student's content area  teachers and ENL teacher in attendance.  If parents are unable to come in phone conferences will be scheduled.  Translators  are brought in as needed.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  Our Parent Coordinator, school staff, and PTA board plan activities throughout the school year to foster parental involvement  for parents of ELLs. These activities include monthly PTA and SLT meetings, regular workshops on topics such as computer skills  and the high school admissions process, informative meetings such as Curriculum Night, and family celebrations, such as the  Hispanic Heritage Month celebration, 3 C's Fall Fiesta, Holiday Showcase, Black History Month celebration, Mother's Day  celebration, and End-Year Talent Show. Spanish translation occurs at all of these events, led by Ms. Medina, Mr. Olivo, or  Spanish-speaking teachers. All of these events foster ELL parent involvement as they are all, in some way, a celebration  of culture. In addition, all fliers and meeting notices are translated into Spanish. Ms. Lam, an office staff member, speaks four  African dialects and contacts parents who speak these languages to alert them of these events.           Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Jorisis Stupart, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Mott Hall III                                                                              School DBN: 09X128  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Parents are given a Home Language Identification Survey to determine what language the family speaks at home.  An informal interview in English and the native language is conducted. If a parent is only able to communicate in  their native language, documentation and translation services will be provided for them. This information is then  recorded in ATS by our school secretary. According to ATS, 28% of parents need documents translated into  Spanish, while less than 3% need documents translated into other languages. We generate and review up-to-date  ATS reports that indicate preferred languages for parents throughout the year, and when parents' language of  preference changes, we ensure that the change is noted on the student's blue card as well as in ATS. This fall, we  have also made a concerted effort to reach out to all families this school year and update their contact  information and language preference in our online student information system. A list of parents' L1 is kept by the  ENL Coordinator.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63     2.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      In the event of a school emergency our we use our robo call system to communicate with our Spanish speaking  parents. We also have Spanish fluent staff members call them directly.             Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure    Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      Professional learning will be conducted during Professional Learning Mondays to ensure that the school community is  aware of and informed on A-663.

Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      We have posted the Welcome poster in a prominent location in the lobby of the building. We have provided parents  with a copy of the Parent's Bill of Rights. We have also provided all parents with a copy of the Expect Success Guide.  We will continue to provide interpretation services at all school events as needed.         Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       We will use a parent survey, as well as interviews with parents, to gather feedback on the quality and availability of  our services for our ELL students.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66
