This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      At P.S. 150 we seek to nurture the intellectual, emotional, social and physical growth of our students as we engage  their hearts and minds in a love of learning. Through child-centered, yet rigorous, curricula integrating the arts,  sciences, math and English language arts, we will create independent, creative and critical thinkers, who will be on the  path to college and career readiness, with the tools to excel in their future endeavors.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    P.S. 150 is a choice school in Tribeca, which gives preference to students who live in lower Manhattan. Our small  community depends on its teachers, parents and students working closely together with mutual respect to achieve  the best educational environment and opportunities we can for each and every child and emphasizes the importance  of participating in a community as an essential part of every child’s education, particularly because of the unique  characteristic of only one class per grade. At P.S. 150, we collaborate with Arts Connection, to provide dance for all of  our students, Dancing Classrooms, to provide Ballroom Dancing for our 5th graders, and Chess NYC to provide chess  for all of our students.    At P.S. 150, through both social studies and science content area studies and arts integration, our students are  exposed to and immersed in interdisciplinary learning. This holistic approach has been a tradition for years and has  proven successful, but most importantly, as an engaging and meaningful way for our students to learn. Each child,  along with acquiring all the necessary skills in English language arts and mathematics, which every year leads to  proficiency and advanced scores on the New York State tests, becomes an “expert” about a particular topic, whether  it be snakes, bridges or Eastern Woodland Indians.   Within the past five years, we have implemented an entirely new mathematics curriculum, departing from the district  wide curriculum that has been in use for more than a decade. We chose Math in Focus, an Americanized version of  Singapore Math to address the Common Core Learning Standards more effectively. The students are now ahead of  students using other curricula. They are embracing it and rising to the challenge.    We are now in our fifth year as a Teachers College Reading and Writing Workshop project school, and have numerous  professional learning opportunities through this institution, including a staff developer, specialty group participation  and coaching workshops. Over the past year, our teachers have shown incredible growth in their pedagogy thanks to  TC.   We continue to work on maintaining an upward trajectory with regard to progress in ELA. In 2016-2017, our scores  rose significantly, thanks to our staff developer from Teachers College. Hopefully, they will for the 2017-2018 school  year as well. She continues to help our teachers apply more effective reading and writing strategies, and we will  continue to work on differentiating appropriately. In addition, we will be focusing more on assessment strategies and  on giving more actionable feedback to our students in both ELA and math, through the use of self-assessments,  journals and rubrics.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   P.S. 150 continues to work hard to meet the needs of all students, including those with IEPs and our English Language  Learners (for whom we have a very small population).      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   P.S. 150 made much progress in rigorous instruction and the key area of focus for next school year will be trust.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 02M150   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   187   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

During the 2017-2018 school year, a Math in Focus staff developer continued to work with the staff, in hopes of  elevating our 2018 Math scores, as to reflect a student body that is grasping sophisticated mathematical concepts,  particularly in solving word problems. Progress was seen these past two years in Math, supporting our theory that  staff development would be beneficial, but we know our students are capable of more mathematically. Hence, we  hope to improve math instruction by continuing to implement a rigorous standards-based curriculum based on our  Math in Focus curriculum, that aligns to the Common Core Standards and that result in an improvement in student  performance on the math exam, particularly focusing on constructed responses for standards 4.OA.A.1; 4.OA.A.3 and  5.G.B.3 and B.4. In addition, we are working on staff development in the area of teaching mathematics in a more  dialogical fashion, and in raising the level of "math talk." We are using a mentor text entitled Good Questions for  Math Teaching and Intentional Talk to help guide the teachers, along with PD in math literacy to reach this goal.

At P.S. 150, we pride ourselves on creating a warm and nurturing environment, where students are supported and  challenged. However, with the challenge of only one class per grade, we have found the need to find a social- emotional program that emphasizes implementing the tools that students will need to work together and solve  problems. This becomes more readily apparent as they grow older. We will continue to implement a program that  begins in Pre-K and continues through 5th grade, with consistent rules and expectations that students can understand,  assimilate and be cognizant of what is expected of them. We chose Responsive Classroom last year We will continue  to implement a social emotional program called Sanford Harmony, which was successful in 2017-2018. Finally, we will  implement a mindfulness program called Mind Up, which focuses on meditation and mindfulness.

P.S. 150 made gains in ELA proficiency for the 2014-2015, 2015-1016 and 2016-2017 school year. We have yet to  receive scores for 2018. However, based on visits to specific classrooms and informal observations, more support for  professional growth of teachers and effective strategies for developing more sophisticated "accountable talk" with  regard to the students is needed. In addition, P.S. 150 only scored a “proficient” on Quality Review indicator 2.2. and  was an area of focus for the 2014-2015 school year. Through opportunities and support from the principal and staff  developers, we hope to improve our students' ability to have richer and deeper conversations with each other about  their reading, along with developing their skills in conducting student led small group instruction.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          32     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S 150, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      P.S 150 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.         School-Parent Compact (SPC)   P.S 150, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is  implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between  the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I,  agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for  improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure  that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36            Provide high quality curriculum and instruction consistent with Common Core State Standards to enable participating  children to meet the State’s Standards and Assessments by:   I.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  ELA data is collected with Teachers College running records as well Fountas & Pinell assessments and Jennifer Serravallo  assessments.  In addition, we give Teachers College baseline on-demand writing assessments.  These results allow us to  implement specific interventions to ELLs that might have particular areas of weakness that need attention prior to NYS  exam.  For students in the third grade, the focus will be on comprehension (delving into character work, thinking about the big  idea of the text, and understanding when a breakdown occurs).  We have a students reading at a J level, and a student reading  at a K level.  The goal is to advance them two levels by the end of the academic year.  In first grade, the goal is to work on both  decoding strategies and comprehension work in reading. The goal is move our student from a C level to a F level.  In writing,  the data indicates that the focus will on supporting the student in creating a story across pages, understanding and using the  writing cycle and increasing phonological awareness.  In Kindergarten, the data points to increasing knowledge of letter sound  correspondence, supporting children in oral story telling, and working on emergent literacy skills.  We hope to have all three  students reading a grade level by the end of the year.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Classroom teachers work closely with the ENL teacher, the SETTS teacher, and the speech therapist to help develop individual  plans and supports for ELLs.  Teachers create their own assessments, such as spelling tests, sight word assessments, and  content study exit slips.  Teachers consistently use observations, rubrics, self (child) and peer evaluations, interviews, and  exhibitions (journals, oral presentations) to guided their teaching.  Based on results, ELL students are placed in small groups for  instruction.  The above-mentioned data allows us to know the levels of our ELLs in terms of phonemic awareness, their  decoding abilities, and their comprehension skills.  This information assists us in differentiating instruction for our ELLs.  All  pedagogues who work with ELLs meet together during weekly grade level meetings, as well as after school to discuss  observations and findings, so as to create supports and scaffolds for ELLs.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Our school uses the NYC Performance Tasks for math, mid-year TCRWP running records as well as TCRWP on-demand writing  assessments.   These evaluations allow us to identify and target areas of need throughout the year. During scheduled days with  a TC professional developer, we review data together, looking closely at the rates of progress, thinking about areas that need  improvement.  We analyze assessments during grade level meetings, study the TC learning progressions, and plan for whole  school discussions to examine why students are showing signs of difficulty in certain areas, such as writing about texts  deeply.  We look at data across the year, as well year to year and implement strategies that we have developed as a team.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once this data has been gathered, the ENL teacher, SETTS provider, speech therapist and classroom teachers meet to review  the information, notice trends and highlight areas of need.  Supports, scaffolds, and both group and individual plans are put in  place to help students in areas that show a lack of growth.  The information is disseminated during grade level meetings,  whole school staff development, lunch hours, as well monthly meeting with out of class providers.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   To help ensure a high quality of teaching, we have staff developers and coaches work with teachers in both literacy and  math.  We ensure that teachers receive ample professional development across the year in areas where they feel supported is  needed.  ELLs are provided with interventions at increasing levels of intensity to accelerate their rate of learning.  Progress is  closely monitored to assess both the learning rate and level of performance of individual students.  Educational decisions  about the intensity and duration of interventions are based on individual student response to instruction. High quality  instruction, ongoing assessment, tiered instruction, and parent involvement are important parts of our response to  intervention.  Our data drives our instruction; we examine trends to understand which areas to target.  Through discussions  (grade level, professional development, after-school meetings) with specialists, teachers and personnel, we examine which  scaffolds and what kind of differentiation to put in place.  We look closely at the amount of years ELLs have received  instructions, discuss progress with parents, review samples of student work in both English and home language (if possible), as  well as examine closely the content area teacher’s recommendations.  This information helps guide the instruction of our ELLs.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The NYSESLAT, ELA and NYC Performance Tasks for math are assessments the school uses to evaluate and inform instruction  for our ELL program.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?  The principal has a copy of information regarding our ELLs that is readily available to all staff members.  During staff  development, we review the findings so that all staff members are informed.  A copy is on file in the main office.  The  administration, specialists (ENL teacher, speech teacher, SETSS teacher) and teachers meet monthly, if not weekly, to discuss  any adjustments being made to the ENL program.  The ENL teacher makes adjustments on a as needed basis.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43           Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Due to our history and small class size (168 students, K-5), we only offer a freestanding ENL program at this time.  The  ENL teacher works closely with the classroom teacher to differentiate and create the needed supports for  ELLs.  Students entitled to 90 or 180 minutes per week of ENL, receive integrated ENL.  For students entitled to 360  minutes of ENL, 180 minutes are integrated and 180 minutes are standalone.  Students are grouped heterogeneously  by grade level.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A        2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Instructional minutes are delivered in 45 minute blocks.  ELLs at the commanding level receive two 45-minute blocks of  integrated ENL instruction per week within the classroom. The ENL teacher works closely with the classroom teacher to find  times in which to integrate ENL that cover the ELA requirements.  (Presently, the ENL teacher only integrates instruction  during times that cover ELA instructional minutes.)  ELLs at the transitioning and expanding levels receive four 45-minute  blocks of integrated ENL instruction per week.  ELLs at the entering or emerging level receive four 45-minute clock of  integrated ENL and four 45-minute standalone ENL. The freestanding ENL program ensures that mandated minutes including  ELA content, as the ENL teacher meets weekly with classroom teachers (whether during lunch time or after school) to review  the plans for the week, to provide all necessary ELA minutes.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   We only offer freestanding ENL as selected by our parents.  Classroom and content area teachers (music, science, art and  technology) use the SIOP program (creating a language-rich environment, simplifying language, supporting academic language  development, and providing opportunities for peer work).  During integrated and standalone sessions by the ENL teacher,  students continue to use hands-on manipulatives, researched based practices (visuals, graphic organizers, and multimedia  technology).  The ENL teacher makes sure to scaffold understanding, group purposefully, and extend background knowledge.  When creating a schedule at the beginning of the year, the ENL teacher verifies that she provides instructional time in each  content core area. The NYS Learning Standards are reviewed carefully. The ENL teacher confirms that students are working  towards meeting those standards by providing the appropriate language focused scaffolds, collaborating closely with content  area teachers,  and using instructional resources that are developmentally and linguistically appropriate, and aligned to the  Common Core Standards. The ENL teacher will support ELLs in meeting the standards by fostering a community where  students discuss content with peers, as well as problem solve in groups.  The ENL teacher consistently integrates explicit and  implicit research based vocabulary instruction.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44      Chinese-speaking ELLs are assessed/evaluated by an ENL teacher from another downtown school.  We call on translators to  help depending on the need.  The ENL teacher works closely with the librarian to ensure that there are library resources (such  as books, software) in student's native language.  The staff meets with our CUNY Technology Intern to review  internet resources that are best suited to support and engage ELLs in their native language. Teachers facilitate peer  interactions in their native language by organizing lunch meetings, and time together before school.  All information accessed  is evaluated by school administration and the CUNY Technology Intern.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    5a) Although we do not have SIFE students, we would build a supportive environment that is linked to the immediate social,  cultural and linguistic needs of the SIFE student.  We would educate staff to be attuned to the cultural and historical  backgrounds and instructional methods of students.  The student and parents would have access to support services  (counselors, mentor, parent coordinator).  We would create a buddy system with peers of classmates who can help the SIFE  student adjust to the daily schedule.  We would also increase the sheltered instruction, and implement flexible scheduling.  We  would adapt standards based lessons so that these lessons cover the most important information in a way that is accessible,  culturally relevant and age appropriate.  We would provide intensive literacy instruction.  Classrooms are print rich, and  instruction would be picture heavy.  We would use the ELA Foundational Low Literacy curriculum to meet the needs of  students.  5b) With newcomer ELLs, we would adapt standards based lessons so that these lessons cover the most important information  in a way that is accessible, culturally relevant and age appropriate.  We would provide intensive literacy instruction, so as to  increase ELL students’ language production.  We would incorporate as much peer interaction as possible, using cooperative  learning groups.  We would explicitly teach the English language vocabulary and structures all the while building on the ELLs  background knowledge to increase comprehension.  It is important to increase ELL parent involvement.  Classrooms are print  rich, and instruction continues to be picture heavy.  We allow for scaffolding in student's native language, we use sentence  frames to support children's thinking and given them practice with academic language, we pre-teach as much as possible,   5c) Just as we do for newcomer ELLs, we simplify the language, not the content.  Lessons that we differentiate are meat to  motivate children to talk.  Our lessons continually expand vocabulary, and we continually engage students in producing  language such as describing, retelling, summarizing, comparing, contrasting...  We review and list instructions step by step.    5d) We would provide the LTELs with language development, literacy development and a program that addresses the  academic gaps they have accrued, focusing on syntax, grammar and vocabulary as well as increasing oral language.  We would  affirm the crucial role of home language in a student’s life and learning and provide home language development whenever  and wherever possible.  Teachers would emphasize oral language and active engagement, making sure there is a safe and  inviting climate in the classroom.  We would ensure that LTELs are given explicit teaching, models, and have support available  to them (such as graphic organizers, visuals, ).  We would use a second program to complement the one we are using, such as  the Specifically Designed Academic Instruction.    5d) Because our ELL population is less than 5%, our plans are tailored to their individual needs.  The ENL teacher meets  consistently with the content area teachers to review areas of need for students and set in place goals.  The ENL teacher  continues to support students with a range of supports and scaffolds, continuously involving peers and creating group work  opportunities.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   We use the Wilson based Fundations Phonemic awareness program to provide early language skills.  For more advanced  students, we use the Wilson Phonemic awareness program. Strategies include using gestures, body language, pictures, models  of the process, preview of materials for optimal learning.  The ELLs follow our standard, rigorous grade-level curricula as non  ELLs as well.  They are reading authentic literature in different genres and reading word problems in mathematics. The  program allows for alternative forms of expressing student understanding and ensures repeated exposure.  Students use   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      graphic organizers to support comprehension.  We use Discovery Education, a website that provides visual clips for students  with language differences and language deficiencies.  Our library provides supplementary books on many different reading  levels and different genres (with a range of pictures books with vocabulary support). We carefully consider the concepts we  wish to teach using the district curriculum guidelines and grade level content standards. When planning lessons, we take in  consideration the student’s first language, the second language proficiency, their reading ability, the difficulties a text might  create, and we reflect upon the student’s background knowledge.   Teachers College Reading and Writing units have inserts specifically for ELLs that differentiate the lesson and give helpful  suggestions as to how to adapt the lesson.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  We are a small school with only one class per grade level, and all students are placed in general education classes.  ENL  programming and SE services are provided to ELL-SWD students using standalone and integrated ENL instruction.  This is the  case for the SETSS provider as well.  These specialized teachers assists students in achieving their IEP goals and in attaining  English proficiency in the least restrictive environment.  Both the SETTS teacher and the ENL meet together weekly to review  future lessons, but also to discuss what goals still need to be met, and how to change instruction to best serve the needs of the  students.  There are times when both the SETTS teacher and the ENL teacher work jointly with a group.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  ELLs receive targeted intervention through standalone and integrated ENL services.  We have four subgroups: one  kindergartener, one first grader, four second graders, and one fifth grader.  We use flexible scheduling so that teachers can  offer integrated ENL in reading, writing, math, and social studies.  The ENL teacher works collaboratively with classroom  teachers and specialists.  Our response to intervention is three tiered: Tier 1 is the effective instruction based on SIOP featuring  the core curriculum, Tier 2 focuses on specific interventions (strategies instruction) and Tier 3 is specialized services such as  reading intervention.  The range of interventions we use are small group individualized instruction, family involvement,  modification of texts and assignments, counseling services, and reading specialist services.  We use all of these interventions in  Math, ELA, science and social studies.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?        We will continue to have Professional Development devoted to creating tools and supports to help children with various  needs.  We will have a staff developer from Goldmansour & Rutherford, who will work specifically with teachers on inclusive  practices and differentiated instruction for all curricular areas.  We will have a Teachers College staff developer who will review  new inserts in the reading and writing curriculum that cater specifically to supporting ELLs.  The ENL teacher is taking part in a  multiple day ELL/MLL Leads workshop. We have also chosen specific specialty at Teachers College which focus on the role of  literacy in math, so as to support staff in thinking deeply about the crosswalks between the two content areas.  Given the data  shown from the assessments discussed above, we believe that it is important to focus on literacy, particularly decoding  strategies in the younger grades, while focusing more on comprehension and character development in the upper grades.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We never had a bilingual program.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.    Information about all curricular and extracurricular school programs is communicated to parents in their preferred  language.  ELLs are required to participate in all programs that are grade specific and curriculum based.  Our fifth graders  pursue a one year study on immigration which resonates with our ELLs and gives them a platform for sharing their personal  experience.  Extracurricular programs include a family workshop with storyteller Bill Gordh, in which children and parents in  tandem create and tell a story based on their family history.  We have a dance resident who supports the dance teacher; she   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      helps create and choreograph dance numbers as well as help instruct singing to all students.   In the fall, all students study  chess thanks to a chess residency.  The student council is open to any student who desires to participate.  Given our small  number of ELLs there are no supplemental programs. However, if students would like to spend time reviewing topics with  specific teachers, there is possibility to meet before or after school. Additionally, some of our ELLs attend Manhattan youth, a  CBO afterschool program, where they receive homework help.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  In math, ELLs are supported with hands-on manipulatives (including imitation coins, counters, tokens, cuisinaire rods, pattern  blocks, unifix cubes, 3D blocks, large clocks).  In reading and writing, social studies and science, we use visuals, models, graphs,  videos and music to support ELLs.  In all content areas we use interactive white boards, document cameras, laptops, and  audio-video during instructional time.  We use specific web based resources, such as Colorin Colorado, FluentU, NIH Kid's  pages, ESL Pod Podcast, and Rewordify.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Home language is supported by the use of dictionaries, glossaries, books, visuals, and posters in student’s home language.  The  ENL teacher works closely with the librarian to ensure that there are library resources available in each student's native  language.  The staff meets with our technology aid to review internet resources that are best suited to support and engage  ELLs in their native language. We enlist the support of other ENL teachers and translators to help with assessments. We are in  constant communication with families and are readily available for any feedback or questions.        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Our ENL teacher and classroom teachers meet at the beginning of the year to review the results of the NYSESLAT and  NYSITELL.  We work collaboratively to develop the flexible schedule of integrated and stand alone instruction.  This allows us to  order materials accordingly, including high interest books, and books that are picture heavy with vocabulary support.  We use  different websites that help alter texts to meet the level of the ELLs, all the while conveying the important ideas.  All the  supports and resources that we use are based on assessment performance throughout the year.  The curriculum that is used  meets the Common Core Standards, and is age appropriate.  When working with ELLs, we ensure that the resources being used  are agreed upon by the administration so that all materials are at grade level.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    We do not share the building with another school.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   When ELLs enroll in our school, we meet with the parents and enlist the help of a translator if need be.  We offer an  orientation of the school before the official start date so that parents and students can tour the schools and meet with the  staff.  We have former ELLs walk newcomers through the school once the year begins.  We have a welcome pot-luck for all  parents in early September.  We offer peer tutoring (pairing newly enrolled ELLs with an English speaking classmate to provide  academic and emotional support).  There is a buddy system for parents in which newly enrolled families are paired with a  returning family at the same grade level.  These activities are overseen by the parent coordinator and the guidance counselor.       17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Given the small size of our school, there are no language electives.        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47         In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   We do not have a dual language program.     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?    We will continue to have a Teachers College staff developer providing 20 days of PD on literacy development including ways to  support ELLs.  All teachers participate in TC Conferences days, which cover a range of topics.  The ENL teacher takes part in  multiple in staff development solely focused on supporting ELLs.  All in all, each of our classroom teachers received (and will  continue to do so) approximately 20 hours ELL PD from Teachers College.  The Division of English Language Learners & Student  Support regularly offers professional development centered around ELLs, but focusing on different academic content  areas.  The ENL teacher will continue to attend sessions that can support her in teaching her students.  We also receive  support from Borough Support Specialists, including training of data analysis of exams (NYSESLAT, NYSISTELL); ELL  identification; Mandates (Part 154); ENL.  Our parent coordinator receives training from the District 2 Family Advocate and  FACE.  Our guidance counselor and school secretary receive training from the Manhattan Borough Field Support Center.  We  have bi-weekly meetings before schools with all non-pedagogic staff to review pertinent information regarding our ELLs.   We will continue to have Professional Development devoted to creating tools and supports to help children with various  needs.  We will have a staff developer from Goldmansour & Rutherford, who will work specifically with teachers on inclusive  practices and differentiated instruction for all curricular areas (dates to be determined).  We will have a Teachers College staff  developer who will review new inserts in the reading and writing curriculum that cater specifically to supporting ELLs (20 full  days).  The ENL teacher is taking part in a multiple day ELL/MLL Leads workshop (Sept 19th, Oct 19th, Nov 28th, Jan 17th,  March 8th). We have also chosen specific specialty at Teachers College which focus on the role of literacy in math, so as to  support staff in thinking deeply about the crosswalks between the two content areas (Sept 28th, Nov 10th, Jan 26th, March  23rd, May 11th).  Given the data shown from the assessments discussed above, we we are focusing on literacy, particularly  decoding strategies in the younger grades, while focusing more on comprehension and character development in the upper  grades.        2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.    At PS 150, the staff meets every Monday afternoon from 3:00-4:20.  Over the course of the school year, the discussion topics  include differentiating instruction for ELLs, scaffolding strategies (such as schema building, text re-presentation, modeling,  bridging, metacognition, and contextualizing instruction).  Our TC staff developer, as mentioned above, will discuss specific  inserts dedicated to ELLs in the reading and writing curriculum.  As the staff developer works with all teachers, this will count  as our ELL specific professional development.  As described in the above paragraph, the ENL teacher will meet ELL specific  professional development thanks to PD described.  Our principal maintains a professional development binder in which all  attendance sheets and agendas are stored in date order from September to June.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   The ENL teacher meets with parents in September to discuss goals and plans for the year.  Additional meetings are held on an  as-needed basis.  The classroom teacher and ENL teacher (the SETTS teacher is available if necessary) allow for more time  than usual ELL parent teacher conferences so that all goals can be discussed in depth,  These meetings may be initiated by  parents or by a school staff member.  Depending on the case, we meet with the classroom teacher and any other service  providers so that we can answer any questions and discuss the child with input from all staff that work with the ELL in  question.  We enlist the help of interpreters, if needed, so that parents can participate in meeting in their preferred language.  If a parent is not able to come in to meet, we can have the conference over the phone.  Records of meetings are kept by  teachers, service providers and are noted in the cumulative folders.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  We invite all parents, including ELL parents, to publishing parties and curriculum celebrations, music and dance performances,  parent workshops, and fundraisers.  We encourage all ELL parents to attend PTA meetings and to volunteer on PTA  committees or to support teachers in the classroom by chaperoning on class trips, helping with a project or volunteering for an  activity.  We try to accommodate parents depending on their level of comfort by creating situations in which they feel  comfortable.  We invite parents of ELLs to share parts of the culture with the class if they are interested in doing so.  Our  parent coordinator works with teachers to communicate with parents in their preferred language, and by arranging for  translation services.  Our parent coordinator also reaches out to ELL parents by extending a personal invitation to many  events.  Most of the parents of ELLs attend functions at the school, and some even volunteer through the PTA.  For families  whose work schedule do not afford them flexibility, we are happy to work with them to find times and activities that are  suitable for them.  We are happy to create specific informational sessions for particular parents that have concerns or  questions. Some examples of parent engagement projected for the month of October are: Oct 12th, 4th Grade Rummage Sale  (volunteering possibilities),   Oct 13th, Family Math Friday, Oct 17th, PTA meeting, Oct 19th, Parent Workshop on Punctuality,            Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Jennifer Bonnet, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PS 150                                                                              School DBN: 02M150  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
