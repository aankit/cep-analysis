The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.   In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets, the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement    NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             8      Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.

The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.     Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             9      monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title   I schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             10   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Section 4: SCEP Overview               The Urban Assembly Academy will provide a nurturing, academically challenging environment that supports the  educational success and social development of our students. Courses will be taught by dedicated teachers with a  heightened focus on the needs and interests of each individual learner. Students will be respectful, self-disciplined,  productive citizens who think critically, make informed decisions, and act ethically. Our students will have a prideful  foundation of cultural awareness in the spirit and in actions the true meaning of being a leader.            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   UAAFL’S faculty will foster productive relationships with students, families and the community to ensure students are  respectful, prepared and focused learners.   We will have focused attention on improving our student’s social and emotional capacity along with their proficiency  on state exams in math and English Language Arts ( ELA). We realize that our students need experience in reading  informational texts,opportunities to talk to their peers about their perspectives and thoughts and time to write to  synthesize new information. Through teacher participation in Instructional rounds, Lesson Study, Middle School  Quality Initiative( MSQI), Hunter College Title IIB grant, Algebra for All, and Urban Assembly weekly coaching support  we will increase the number of students meeting and exceeding proficiency on the NY math and ELA exams.   Our curriculum reflects the values and needs of our redesigned school. We have increased our partners to   ensure that our students have increased course options, embedded social and emotional learning supports, and  opportunities for choice and extended learning time. We will partner with the following organizations to support our  re-designed instructional program for students:   1. Lincoln Center Education: Arts in the Middle Program- This five -year partnership provides students with exposure  to the arts through regular trips to Lincoln Center and local museums. All students are provided visual art instruction  throughout the school day, with units of instruction leading to a culminating event.   2. Citizen Schools: This partnership comprises our expanded learning time program for students. This will result in the  school day for our students beginning at 8:20am and ending at 5:30pm. All students will be provided with additional  academic instruction, support and enriching extracurricular activities. Everyday, student will have time for additional  academic support in ELA and math instruction and supervised homework time. Additionally, students will participate  in college and career explorations as well as enjoy enrichment activities such as sports, art and music. Students will  also have opportunities to explore different careers through weekly apprenticeships alongside experts in the field.   In addition to the partnerships listed above we will also participate in the following DOE initiatives and programs for  the 2017-2018 school year:         College Access for All    Urban Advantage   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             11                 The Apollo Theater    Global Scholars        Urban Assembly Resilient Scholars Program    MSQI   STEM- A Face Lab  Shubert Theatre Arts   3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   The Urban Assembly Academy for Future Leaders (UAAFL) is a consolidated middle school that comprises the students  and staff from Renaissance Leadership Academy and Urban Assembly Institute for New Technologies. Located in  Harlem, UAAFL serves approximately 140 students for the 2018-2019 school year. The student body includes  approximately 15% English Language Learners (ELL's) with Spanish being the dominant native language.  Approximately 30% of students have Individualized Educational Plans (IEP's) and receive services along the continuum  which include Integrated Co-teaching, Special Education Teacher Supports Services (SETSS), related serves such as  speech and language and counseling. The average student attendance rate is 90%. The majority of students are  considered economically disadvantaged as over 95 % qualify for free or reduced lunch. According to combined data  from the Degrees of Reading Power assessment, 36% of rising 7th grade students are reading on or above grade level,  15% of rising 8th grade students are reading on or above grade level. The data indicates that there is room for literacy  growth and daily instruction must embed effective literacy structures and Common Core shifts throughout all content  areas. Literacy instruction throughout all content areas will be the primary instructional focus for UAAFL. All students  will participate in classes that support reading comprehension and fluency, genre based writing and speaking using  academic vocabulary. Students will have opportunities to reflect, revise and self assess in their math, ELA, social  studies , science and electives courses.         4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.  During the 2017-18 school year our areas of celebration are as follows:   1. Rigorous Instruction: The school made significant gains in ELA state test results. The school increased 6 percentage  points for students meeting and exceeding state standards. Also noted among sub groups are the following:    Female Students - 23% to 29% (gain of 6%)     All Students - 17% to 23% (gain of 6%)      Male Students - 12% to 17% (gain of 5%)    Black Students - 19 to 22% (gain of 3%)    Hispanic Students - 11% to 23% (gain of 12%)    General Education - 22% to 32% (gain of 10%)    English Language Learners - 0% to 20% (gain of 20%)    Not Economically Disadvantaged - 24% to 43% (gain of 19%)    Economically Disadvantaged - 15% to 21% (gain of 6%)    *Data compiled from data.nysed.gov   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             12      1. Rigorous Instruction: The school made significant gains in Mathematics state test results. The school increased 5  percentage points for students meeting and exceeding state standards. Also noted among sub groups are the  following:      All Students - 4% to 9% (gain of 5%)  Female Students - 4% to 6% (gain of 2%)      Male Students - 4% to 11% (gain of 7%)    Black Students - 4 to 8% (gain of 4%)    Hispanic Students - 1% to 5% (gain of4%)    General Education - 5% to 13% (gain of 8%)    Non-English Language Learners - 4% to 9% (gain of 20%)    Not Economically Disadvantaged - 9% to 21% (gain of 12%)    Economically Disadvantaged - 2% to 7% (gain of 5%)   *Data compiled from data.nysed.gov   2. Supportive Environment: The school achieved significant declines in school incidents and student suspensions in a  one year period. The data is as follows:     126 school incidents to 32 (75% decline)    45 student suspensions to 23 (49% decline)   For the 2018-2019 School Year, the focus areas are the following:   1. Rigorous Instruction: Though significant gains were made in ELA and Mathematics, the overall performance of our  students on state exams is still below New York State averages.    2. Effective School Leadership: An element of strong school leadership is the ability to communicate a vision for the  school. Urban Assembly Academy for Future Leaders has the theme of leadership that we believe is at the core of  everything we do; we are developing the next leaders of our country. We want this to be reflected in how our  students carry themselves, we want them to see the leadership that exists in all of us. By developing a clear vision for  the school and clear goals for our teachers and students we will have created a pathway to the success that is  achievable for our school.   3. Supportive Environment: For our school to develop the next leaders, the school must be a symbol of leadership. As  a means of supporting our students in their leadership development our school will be transforming its physical space  to best reflect the themes of leadership. Additionally, our school deans and teachers will be trained in restorative  practice techniques so that conversations around school culture are not merely punitive but proactive.                  2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             13         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 05M286   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   169   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Feedback from an accumulation of 2017-2018 Superintendents visits indicate the following:   There is the need to improve instructional practices by addressing an inconsistency in providing higher order  questioning to push students’ thinking as well as incorporating multiple entry points to support their distinct learning  needs.    Additionally, during the 2016-17 school year we were visited by the New York State Education Department (NYSED)  Integrated Intervention Team (IIT). The team made recommendations around teacher practices and decisions and  curriculum development which tie into rigorous instruction. The recommendations suggested that there was a need to  support teachers' understanding of the instructional implications of data and a need to support the development of  teacher practice and accountability. We believe that our work on the educational learning objectives touches on both of  these State recommendations. The development of the ELOs stemmed from an analysis of the State data from last years  ELA and Math exams. Creating power standards for each grade level required an understanding of the data as well as  the curriculum for each grade level for Math and ELA. Using the ELOs to guide each Unit of study will inform teachers  throughout the year of the progress students are making toward mastery of each power standard.

During the 2016-17 school year our school was visited by the New York State Education Department (NYSED) Integrated  Intervention Team (IIT). The team provided feedback regarding specific school practices and recommendations for  improvement. One recommendation around effective school leadership that will be implemented during this school  year focuses on the Principal's communication and expectations with the assistant principals. It was suggested that the  Principal outline specific short and long-term goals with the assistant principals and create check-in points to discuss  progress. One of these long-term goals is centered on our strategy around academic achievement. Both assistant  principals will be working with the Math and ELA departments to create Educational Learning Objectives which will drive  instruction for each unit of study. The principal will be meeting with the assistant principals weekly to discuss the data  and progress of the ELOs. These meetings will be scheduled and meeting notes will document the progress and  developing goals for the APs.      Additionally, a review of our most recent Quality Review shows a developing rating in indicator "1.2". Indicator 1.2 is  defined as "Research based, effective instruction that yields high quality work. " This is informed by "shared beliefs  informed by the Danielson Framework and aligned to pedagogy and curricula." According to the ADVANCE system data,  51% of the teaching staff had ratings of "Developing" in Domain Three: Instruction.

ELT provides enriching  educational experiences that happen outside of the traditional school day and blend skill acquisition, relationship- building and fun to foster academic and social-emotional growth. Summer learning, afterschool programming, and  extended-day ELT models, when well-implemented, play a critical role in supporting students in all grades and ensuring  that they graduate from high school, college and career ready. SED requires that Priority schools offer a minimum of 200  additional student contact hours as Expanded Learning Time in addition to the current mandated length of 900 hours of  instruction per year (25 hours per week) in grades K-6 and 990 hours of instruction per year (27.5 hours per week) in  grades 7-12. Effective ELT models will blend school staff with community partners, and will provide a balanced  curriculum that can include ELA, Math, STEM, arts, physical activity, and leadership development. Complete the sections  on this page to demonstrate how the school will meet these requirements.     Part 1 – ELT Program Goal(s)   Describe the summative goal(s) of the ELT program for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to be  SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.    By June 2019, there will be a 10% increase in the number of students who score proficient or better on the Common  Core State exams in Math and ELA as a result of additional core instructional strategies.        Part 2 – ELT Program Type    Is the ELT program voluntary or compulsory?      Voluntary   X   Compulsory   If the ELT program is voluntary, indicate how you will actively encourage the participation of all students, with the  goal of serving at least 50% of students.   N/A        Part 3 – ELT Program Description    The ELT program will be offered to all students eligible for Academic Intervention Services (AIS), with the goal of  serving a minimum of fifty percent of AIS-eligible students.  Describe how the school will meet the following SED requirements for an ELT program in a Priority School:     Integrate academics, enrichment, and skill development through hands-on experiences that make learning  relevant and engaging.     Offer a range of activities that capture student interest and strengthen student engagement in learning so as to   promote higher attendance, reduce risk for retention or drop out, and increase the likelihood of graduation.     Actively address the unique learning needs and interests of all types of students, especially those who may   benefit from approaches and experiences not offered in the traditional classroom setting.     Contain components designed to improve student academic, social, and emotional outcomes, including   opportunities for enrichment programs such as in music and art.     Ensure instruction in any core academic subject offered in the program will be delivered under the supervision of   a teacher who is NYS certified in that particular content area.     Engage in outreach activities made to families.   Sheltering Arms and ELITE programs unlock student potential by providing a safe environment for children to develop  away from the negative influences on their streets. Our unique combination of project-based learning, character  development, and eye-opening opportunities puts at-risk children on track to success.   The Sheltering Arms program at UA Academy for Future Leaders runs Monday - Friday 2:30 - 5:30PM. During this time  students participate in Academic Enrichment, apprenticeships, choice clubs and receive targeted homework support.   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             36      Academic Enrichment:   45 minutes Monday - Thursday for a total of 180 minutes weekly.   Choice Clubs:   60 minutes three times a week.    Choice Club provides students the opportunity to further develop their 21st century skills, while building awareness in  social emotional learning. Choice Clubs provides an opportunity for students to be joyful, develop positive  relationships, and have a choice in their educational opportunities. Choice Club allows students to find a sense of  belonging within the school community and enjoy their time here, which will lead to greater investment in academics.  It offers time for students to pursue their interests or explore new interests. It offers time for students to positively  socialize with each other and their teachers in a less formal setting. Some Choice Clubs include scrap-booking, song  writing, drawing, knitting, blogging, film making etc. Students select a new club every 6 weeks.   AIM   Students will have 45 minutes daily to work on homework assignments with support from a Citizen Schools staff  member. Class sizes are smaller with 15:1 ratio which provides more individual attention for each child.    Family Communication   Bi-weekly communication (twice a month). It is expected that communication is meaningful and used to keep families  proactively involved. We recognize that families are our students’ first teachers and we want to make sure that the  line of communication is open and honest in an effort to best support our students. Engaged families have an  incredibly positive impact on student behavioral and academic growth, thus underpinning all of the work that we  hope to accomplish with students this year. Citizen Schools teachers are responsible for family communication  around their students’ progress, adjustment to the program in all aspects (social emotional and academic in  particular), as well as any important program/school information every two weeks.         Part 4 – ELT Program Implementation and Oversight   Part 4a. Who will implement the ELT program? Who will oversee the program?  1.

Explain how you will evaluate the program to assess impact on student achievement.  The Campus Director in conjunction with a school administrator oversee the program each day. Nine teachers also  participate in the program and have a residency with a teaching fellow to ensure high quality programming.   Apprenticeships and Community Partnerships:   For 80 minutes on Tuesday’s and Thursday’s volunteers from corporations and the community partner with a  Sheltering Arms teacher to plan and execute a high-quality 10 week project-based learning experience for students.  We hold apprenticeships to expose students to a variety of new topics and activities and provide students with  authentic exposures to various careers. Our objective is for students to apply what they learn in the first shift to  create a high quality, professional project that demonstrates new skills and mastery. We hope to inspire a love for  learning by helping kids discover their passions. Some apprenticeships include Girls Who Code, Lego Robotics, Shark  Tank, Video Game Design, Neuroscience, Debate, and many more.   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             37      Program Evaluation is conducted every six weeks using a rubric aligned to UAAFL goals.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.       2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the strategies and activities for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, staff, and  paraprofessionals that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   Professional development for School leaders, teachers, and paraprofessionals is on going and based on the needs of  the adults. Professional learning is chosen and designed according to grade and school identified needs and observed  needs as measured by Danielson observations conducted by school leaders. We have established a professional  development committee made up of an instructional coach, teacher leaders, Guidance Counselor, Citizen Schools  Campus Director, and paraprofessionals. The professional development committee meets on a weekly basis to discuss  the needs of the staff and make recommendations to the principal about professional learning that is needed.  Professional learning is then offered at a school-wide level during the contractual professional learning times after  dismissal on Mondays. If the sessions that are being offered do not meet the needs of individual teachers or grade  levels, those teachers and grades have the option to plan self-guided professional learning opportunities that target  various content areas or individual needs. Paraprofessionals work alongside teachers in their assigned content area  focus groups. Professional development for paraprofessional are focused on building content expertise and their role  as a teachers aid. Professional development is led by school leaders, instructional coaches, department team leaders,  and grade leaders. School leaders receive professional development from research based organizations in the areas of  literacy development, time management, math instruction, teacher development, school management, accountability  structures, effective use of data and building leadership capacity.

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/information,  early intervention services, etc.).  N/A        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Our school uses multiple assessment tools throughout the year to assess student performance and progress in a given  area. A MOSL team was assembled to decide which assessments would be used to measure student progress and as  well as teacher effectiveness. Other assessments that are used are DRP, I-Ready math assessment, and DESSA. The  decision to use these programs was made collaboratively by school leaders, and teachers based on research and  effectiveness through use. Professional learning is provided for all staff to administer the assessments, score the  assessments, analyze the data, and create action plans to address the needs as implicated by the data.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             46        Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             47      Section 10: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Urban Assembly Academy for Future Leaders, in compliance with the Section  1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent  involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the  families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision- making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School  Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of  the school community.       Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Urban Assembly Academy for future Leaders will support parents and families of Title I students by:   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             48      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  families/parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities.  The school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g.,ESSA/State accountability  system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning  Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Elementary and Secondary (ESSA) Act;   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             49      ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.         School-Parent Compact (SPC)   Urban Assembly Academy for Future Leaders in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of  student achievement between the school and the families.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  The student's reading levels are assessed using the Degrees of Reading Power (DRP) assessment. Based on the results of the  data, most students are reading below grade level. Teachers will provide differentiation instruction- tasks, texts, processes,  and support for all of our ELL students. This information will help to assist teachers in providing an instrutional plan to meet  the needs of all our students including our ELL population.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?        3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             55      ELL students are assessed using Fountas and Pinell reading assessment at the beginning, middle and end of the year. Based on  the results, goals are created for each student. Throughout the  year, students are assed formally and informally by the ENL  teacher and their general education teachers. Progress towards the students' goals are regulary reviewed and discussed.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?         5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]                  6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The data tha has been revelead to us across performance levels and grades is that students are becoming more proficient in  the English language. We can clearly see that students who begin with us in the 6        th       grade show a vast of improvement  as they reach the next grade.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?               Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Students receive ENL services using the stand alone and intergrated ENL model or both depending on their  profeciency level. .  Push-in periods are done during ELA periods twice a week.   Students are pulled out of mainstream classes in order to receive direct ENL instruction.  The number of periods they  are   pulled out are in accordance to their mandates.  Groups are heterogeneous (mixed proficiency levels). The highly  licensed pedagogue is able to differentiate instruction to address the learning needs and styles of our students. Stand  -Alone for entering student is 180 minutes and emerging student is 90 min . The intergrated ENL for entering is 180  min. and emerging students  is 90 min in ELA. For Transitioning is 90 min. of ENL/ELA instruction and also stand alone  of 90 min. The expanding students have intergrated ENL with 180 min. of other content area (Science/Math) The  commanding student has 90 min per week of integrated ENL service in content areas of ELA, Science or Math. At this  time we are in the process of seeking a highly qualified ENL teacher as we partner with a co-existeing school in our  building, however our intergrated services are provided with a licensed highly qualified bilingual teacher and a license  highly qualified content area teacher. The stand alone services are provided by a license highly qualified bilingual  teacher.       b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?                                 There are two highly qualified teachers who deliver ESL instruction.  The number of instructional minutes  students receive according to students' proficiency levels is currently in compliance.  Students at the entering level receive 360  minutes of ENL instruction of stand alone for 180 and intergrated for 360 min. Students at the emerging levels receive 360  minutes of ESL instruction per week with 180 min stand alone and  180 min of intergrated teaching, transitioning is 90 min. of  stand alone and 90 min. of intergrated service which is 180 minutes. For the expanding student 180 mn of intergrated  instruction and the commanding (proficent level) 90 min. with intergrated ENL provider and content area teacher per week.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.                   Students in grades 6 and 7 receive 8 periods of ELA, 8 periods of math, 4 periods of science, and 4 periods of social  studies instruction weekly.  Students in grade 8 receive 8 periods of ELA, 8 periods of math, 5 periods of science, and 5 periods  of social studies instruction weekly.  The workshop model is used in order to provide students with the appropriate  supports.  The first five to seven minutes of a period is devoted to informally assess students' knowledge or review the  material covered during the previous lesson.  The next 10 minutes are used to model a strategy or teach a concept.  Students  then get to practice the skill either independently , with a partner, or with a group.  During practice, the teacher confers with  the students and based on assessments may offer additional support for students in the form of guided groups, or  differentiation of the task, content or process.  Activities throughout the unit are scaffolded in order for students to develop  the skills/knowledge necessary to successfully complete the unit project which reflects the instructional objectives of the  unit.  The unit project and activities throughout the unit are aligned with the Common Core Learning Standards.  Teachers are  also adjusting the way in which they ask questions during class, and design questions on worksheets, quizzes and tests so that  the questions are academically rigorous.  The last 10 minutes are used to assess student progress.  Teachers design the next  lesson based on the results of the various assessments throughout the class period.     Throughout the core subject areas, reading strategies are emphasized.  Teachers acknowledge student gaps in reading and  writing skills.  As a result, teachers ensure that students have the opportunity to practice a particular reading skill during  class.  ESL strategies discussed during meetings and/or PD are implemented as well. ENL students are able to pair up with  students who speak their native langusge and have discussions about the lesson and task. There is also opportunity for  students to write in their native language and summarize in English if they feel their writing skills are stronger in their native  language.      The highly qualified license bilingual teacher co-teaches with the highly qualified licensed content area ELA teacher to support  he ELLs who require intergrated ENL services working in grade level text material in English. The teachers scafold and plan for  differentiated instruction based on the proficiency levels of our ENL students.  He works with students individually and/or in  guided groups.  Students are assigned the same task as their peers, however, ESL strategies are used to support their  development.  During stand-alone, students are given explicit ESL instruction.               4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?                   We can ensure the ELLs are appropriately evaluated in the their home language by the Home Language survey which  is completed by the parent and the student. The ENL teacher , a staff member or a a member of the Translation and  Interpretation Unit who speaks the native language can assess if the ELLs are being appropriately evealuated in their native  language.  There are opportunities in the classroom for students to be paired up with a student who speaks the same native  language and can engage in academic conversation in home language and can tell the teacher how the student is coming along   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             57      in their home language as suppose to comprehension of the subject matter. There are also opportunities for students to read  in their HL and summarize in English what he or she is reading to assess comprehension.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    For SIFE students they are given a pre assessment to asses where they are in literacy, writing and Math. Based on the  assessments, student portfolio, cummulative folder and academic history teachers are able to provide differentiated  instruction such as graphic organizers, visuals, videos, computer software such as Brain pop that have language subtitles with  animation and real world connections to every content area. They also recive extra academic support from our Academic  Intervention specialist (AIS) coordinator in the areas where students lack the skills.   We provide stand alone services for our newcomer ENL student who has 0-3 years of ENL services as well as intergrated ENL  with a content area teacher. The newcomer student is provided with materials to develop their writing, reading and listening  skills in the English language. During the intergated ENL services the newcomer students are given opporunity to engage in  discussion using sentence promtpts (starters) in English to build in speaking in phrases and words.           Our long-term ELLs receive ELA instruction as well as ESL services as part of their weekly schedules.  The ENL teacher will  also push-  in with students at-risk, concentrating on long-term ELLs.  Small group instruction allows the student to receive instruction  geared to  his/her specific needs.  The teachers confer in planning sessions.  They examine the data and determine the students’  deficiencies   and then plan programs to strengthen the students’ skills. In addition, some of the students will participate in various test  prep   programs offered by the school.           ELLs identified as having special needs receive ESL services and special education services. In both cases, the students  receive small   group, targeted instruction.  The ENL teacher works on the language deficiencies and the special education teacher works on  the   needs identified in the IEP.  Students with special needs are also encouraged to participate in the ELL Academy to strengthen  their   language skills.      The beginner and intermediate level students are mandated for 360 minutes of ESL instruction per week.  The advanced level   students are mandated for 180 minutes of ESL instruction and 180 minutes of ELA instruction per week.  The class with  intermediate   and advanced level students receives 180 minutes of ESL instruction and 360 minutes of ELA instruction per week.  All of our  ELLs   receive at least 450 minutes of English Language Arts per week, which is above the state mandate.  Instruction is provided by   certified teachers.  Each of our classes serving ELLs has 12 or 13 periods of ESL/ELA push-in services per week.     Explicit ESL plays a very important role in instruction for our ELLs.  Our highly qualifed licensed teacher who provides ENL  services t incorporates activities to develop the students’ skills in listening, speaking, reading, and writing in both  programs.  For example, the teacher incorporates choral/group readings to provide a “safe” environment for practicing the  pronunciation and fluency of words and phrases.  Listening centers allow students to listen to different voices and train their  ears to become attentive to the sounds of the English language.  Concurrently, students internalize the language patterns and  structures in a non-threatening atmosphere.  Peer groups are set-up to provide opportunities for students to share vocabulary  and language expressions as well as ideas before sharing in a whole class setting or have to put their words down on  paper.  Brainstorming, webs and other organizers are activities which develop vocabulary and phrases within groups to   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             58      prepare students for independent written work.  All teachers scaffold speaking, listening, reading, and writing with  developmentally appropriate activities to enable students to master skills and complete higher level activities.            Former ELLs receive mandated intergrated ENL services and also testing accomodations for 2 years. The SIFE, Necomer,  Long-term and Developing ELL's in addition to their mandated ENL services they also recive testing accomodations when  taking any assessments.          6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Activities that are available on EngageNY, Code X Common Core English Language Arts text that are aligned with Expeditionary  Learning and the Common Core Learning Standards are incorporated within the ENL curriculum.  Our ELLs who are also SWD  have access to every program that all of our students have acces to during the school day. They also have use of technology in  each of their classrooms with headphones and teachers follow their tesing accomodations when taking assessments. The IEP  coordinator along with the ENL service provider and content area teachers review the ELL-SWD IEP and make sure the student  has met his/her annual goal and is receiving the appropriate academic service and support based on their need.          7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Explicit ESL instruction scaffolds the learning to enable students to accomplish higher level tasks and work independently in the  reading and writing workshops. Finally, we provide opportunities for ELLs and SWDs to participate in all extra curricular  activities regardless of their language level and also provide non ESL teachers with professional development designed to  promote a better understanding of the specific needs of ELLs and SWDs. Ell's with special needs are assessed and their IEP's  are reviewed so that our ENL instructor as well as other teachers such as their special eduscation teacher may provide them  with the resources and materials as per their IEP and other assessment tools. We use more of the push in model, where the  ENL is teaching along with the content area to allow ELL-students with IEP's to work in a less restrictive area and in engage in  small group, and peer to peer learning with the general education population in the classroom.         8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Students receive remedial instruction in ELA and Math.  Instruction is delivered in English.  ELL SWD students receive Wilson as  intervention for vocabulary, fluency and phonics for ELA in the English language. Differientated instruction for all ELL's is used  in every content area using the program Brain pop. The Science curriculum includes materials from Urban Advantage, Foss kits  , PBS learnina media for use of technology and Brain pop. Science teachers use graphic origanizers, pictographic  representation, mental imagery and physical models, and cooperative learning to support ELLs with the skills needed to  comprehend the lesson and use  their oral, writing, and reading skills through the content area. The Social Studies teachers use  junior scholastic, United States History, graphic organizers, Brain pop to support and teach the Social Studies content to our  ELLs .      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Currently, administration is looking into purchasing and implementing the Great Leaps and a new Common Core version of  Achieve 3000 program. We are also seeking to have the assessment software Degrees of Reading Power DRP to asses and  support students in Literacy. We have incorporated throughout the school day a partnership with Citizenschools who provide  students with academic support, apprecnticeship opprotunities, and social interactions with peers from different grades  through clubs and sports.        10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   None of the programs/sevices will be discontinued.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?

How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Students receive their required number of minutes weekly of ESL instruction.  Instruction is tailored to students' needs as  identified by formal and informal assessments.  Students are offered glossaries and texts in their native language and  encouraged to use their native language with peers through content area support.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Our support and resources are grade and age appropriate.  ELL's are identified and placed in our ESL program within 5 days of  enrollment.  The parent and student are involved in an interview with the ENL instructor and the instructors makes sure the  Home Language survey is administer.  In addition the LAP team goes over every case and ensures that Ell's are receving the  proper services and resources dependant on level and age.          15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Students are provided with the mandated materials for each curriculum area.  Students are free to use the library to check-out  books.

(Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Since ELLs are expected to meet the same standards as all students on their grade level, teachers are welcomed to participate  in   Professional Development workshops that are held by the office of English Language Learners in the NYCDOE.  Information  regarding Professional Development workshops are given to the teachers including bilingual teachers , guidance counselors  and secretary.  Additionally, Professional Development is provided by administration.  Topics covered during Professional  Development is reflective of teachers' needs as determined by observations and teacher surveys.  Department and grade level  and data inquiry meetings are also a part of the teacher's weekly schedule.  The ENL teacher, assistant principal, and outside  consultants provide workshops on ESL strategies so that teachers from all content area Math, Science, Social Studies, and  English Language Arts differentiate their instruction appropriately.  Teachers are encouraged to conduct inter- visitations.  Effective instructional practices specifically designed to help ELLs with language acquisition are the focus of some  of the inter-visitions.       The professional development that is provided to staff that support teachers who service ELLs including bilingual teachers in  the Common Core Learning Standards includes learning how to engage students in questioning and discussion, preparation  and planning of instruction ensuring that there is differentitated of instruction in their lesson. Also that the lesson and activies  are age and level appropriate for the different learners in the classroom. The professional development for teachers who  service ELLs including the bilingual teachers are aligned to the component of the Danielson Framework. The professional  development includes designing a coherent lesson, engaging students in learning, ways to create a safe and nurturing  environment in the classroom, ways of how to develop questions to prompt discussions in groups and peer to peer.  Also  professional development on where there are resources, materials, strategies and techniques to support ELLs in the English  language through all content areas in writing, reading speaking, and listening.            2.

Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Our staff is provided with ongoing professional development to assist our new ELLs transition into middle school and out of  middle school into High School  levels beginning level ELLs to transition into middle school into High School from our Guidance  Counselor and school leaders. This process works nicely for our school because our teachers loop up with our students, so they  not only get to know and grow with our students, they also conduct case studies in which they can share best practices with a  teacher who may just be beginning with a new group of 6        th       gradersand can show how students who are now in 8         th       grade have made so much progress and what specific practices were most effective. Guidance Counselor provide  workshops and activities to staff on how to help students including ELLs and ELL-SWD select the proper schools due to their  academic level, interest and environment.  Counselors also provide activities to staff members to assist ELL's in goal settings,  good study and work study habits.

Teachers keep a binder with copies of agenda for each meeting and professional development.  Attendance is taken and documented for every meeting and also kept in a binder.                Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   All members of the school faculty and staff are charged with continually recruiting parents to participate in all aspects of the  school community. Our Parent Coordinator uses various methods including the distribution of flyers, phone contact, scheduled  meetings, and focused workshops to promote family invovlement in the school community. Parent meetings provide families  with strategies to support their child academically and socially. Translation services are provided for parent/guardians. The  Parents of ELL students have an annual one to one meeting with the ENL service provider to discuss their child's language  progress and development. If parents can not attend these face to face meetings, a phone conversation is used and the office  of Translation and Interpretation unit is contacted if translation/ interpretation services is needed.       2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Parents in our school are always encouraged to be involved with the academic and social events that we create for all  memebers of our community. We have a number of ways to remain in contact with our parents. One way is through our online  environment; we use jupitergrades.com, our online grading and comunication system and our schools'swebsite  (www.rlascholars.com) to share information with our students and families. Each parent, student and staff member has an  email acoount and online access to our classes, lessons, and school resources. Parents receive electronic messages from their  child's teacher about the academic and social progress of their child. We communicate with our families daily. We provide  translation and interpretation services if needed from correspondance and/or conversation with school staff. The parent  coordinator assures that ELL parents receive these services and are involved in school activities.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Melisha Jackman, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             63                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Renaissance Leadership Academy                                                                              School DBN: 05M286  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Every school year, parents are provided with a survey which asks the different languages spoken at home. The SLT  and ELL team review our existing procedures to assist parents whose primary language is not English. Meetings  are held with the Parent Coordinator, Community Director, LAC coordinator and ESL instructor on addressing the  needs of Limited English-proficient parents. The team provides ways to deliver services such as methods of  communication through translation and interpretation to parents in a written and oral form. Documents that are  sent to parents are reviewed, considered and discussed as well as other documents needed in the future for  translation. Enlisting the support of other staff members who are fluent in the languages spoken by our Limited- English proficient parents are put into practice as well. We have a diverse population of staff members that serve  as translators for parents in meetings, events and conferences.           2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             65     2.
