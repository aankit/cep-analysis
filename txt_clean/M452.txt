This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   PS 452 is a dynamic learning environment where everyone collaborates to achieve success for our children. We hold  ourselves accountable to children, families, and staff from diverse cultural, ethnic, linguistic, and economic  backgrounds to succeed together. We strive to provide a caring and nurturing environment to develop children as  learners, thinkers, communicators, and citizens.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    PS 452 is an elementary school that serves children from grade Pre-Kindergarten through 5th Grade. PS 452 focuses  the educational experiences for children through content based-learning. Social Studies and Science inquiry drives the  curriculum. Many opportunities to leave the classroom for exploratory purposes to museums, landmarks, parks,  neighborhoods and cultural institutions; group projects that require the children to plan, research, organize and  share; goal-oriented units that use technology, art, drama and movement to express ideas; assessments based on NY  State Standards that inform students what they know well and are able to do; and clear expectations so children are  aware of the journey of each study. We guide students to demonstrate learning with the types of products and  performance that match our time.   In order to meet the needs of the whole child, PS 452 incorporates social emotional learning as an explicit component  of the school experience. Using social emotional teaching and learning standards, we make explicit social emotional  learning an integral part of our learning day so that children possess the ability to recognize their emotions and  resolve differences peaceably.   Our goal-oriented units use technology, art, drama and movement to express ideas. Currently we engage our primary  grade students in the exploration of the foundations of music and begin to foster their visual artist-self through many  mediums. Upper grade students begin to diversify their learning through choral work, differentiated instrumentation,  art history, art making, art critique, and advanced visual artistic creation.   PS 452 has developed significant partnerships with the National Dance Institute and Salvadori Institute in an effort to  broaden the scope of learning beyond classroom instruction; the visiting teaching artists work closely with teaching  faculty to incorporate curriculum across the grades.   Professional growth is a high priority so the reflective faculty profit from varied opportunities to share and develop  strengths as individuals and members of the teaching community. We continue to partner and collaborate with  leaders in the educational field from Teacher’s College, Metamorphosis, and G&R Inclusive Practices. Ongoing  curriculum mapping and work with Teachers College staff developers further support literacy instruction that is  aligned to the instructional shifts. Curriculum mapping is also supported by consultants from Metamorphosis who  reinforce mathematics instruction.   Teachers meet regularly to analyze assessment data, classroom practice and student work. Each grade level team has  a common prep period at least twice a week. Teacher study groups provide an opportunity for teachers to meet in  cross-grade groups to deepen pedagogy and content knowledge. During the teacher team meetings there is a well- developed culture of collaboration, and collegial work supported by all. There is honest reflection and a willingness to  learn from each other.   Because of the diverse learners it serves, the school community constantly pushes itself to better serve the needs of  these learners and strengthen its community.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   The student body includes 3% English language learners and 19% special education students.      4.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 452 , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the  Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   [School name] will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Elementary and Secondary School Act;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.               School-Parent Compact (SPC)   P.S.452, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is  implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I,  agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for  improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure  that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  The TCRWP'S reading assessments are used to determine the early literacy skills of our ELLs. We learn if the students can  identify letters and their corresponding sounds. Their recognition of high frequency words and their concept of print are also  ascertained. We use running records throughout the year to place the students on the appropriate level of just right books. To  assess the development of writing skills we use a pre-test before each unit of study. The students are asked to provide an on  demand writing sample, which is then assessed through the use of a rubric. The results of the writing sample drive instruction.  Informal teacher assessment and teacher created assessments are also used to design lessons that meet the needs of the  students and are aligned with New York State Common Core Learning 'Standards. Using the knowledge from assessments, we  then can differentiate instruction. From these assessments, we have learned that our ELLs master speaking and listening faster  than they do reading and writing.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43         The ENL teacher and the  classroom teachers meet regularly to ensure  optimal delivery of instruction based on the results of  the assessments.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We use the NYSITELL and the NYSESLAT to ascertain the ELLs' strengths and areas of need. We also use TCRWP reading  assessments.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    We have Academic Intervention Services, which is a small-group pull-out program to address students who are struggling with  reading, writing and content areas. In the classroom, we also  utilize small group instruction and individualized  instruction.  Teachers employ Response to Intervention ((RTI)  that begins with Tier 1 strategies which includes high-quality  differentiated instruction.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Classroom teachers are currently using the ELA assessments described above in Question 3, as well as teacher created  assessments to determine the level of their students. Teachers then provide Tier I instruction, taking detailed conference  notes and monitoring the progress of their students.  Several weeks after the intervention plan is implemented, a meeting is  held with the classroom teacher, the ENL teacher, and any service providers that are instructing the ELL to discuss his progress.  If the ELL has not made any progress in his academic and language development, new measures are implemented In Tier II,  such as services from the AIS teacher.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   We analyze the NYSITELL  and NYSESLAT results for each student which we ascertain by going to the RLAT screen on ATS.  The  ELL Data Analysis Tool ( EDAT) is a fantastic tool for identifying prospective strategies for working with ELL subgroups.  Unfortunately, since our ELL population is only twelve across various grades, EDAT does not work for us.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The classroom teachers are provided with an analysis of the results of the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT by the ENL teacher, Marsha  Noble. The ENL teacher discusses the results of the tests with the student's classroom teacher during a meeting at the  beginning of the school year. Periodically during the year, the teachers meet with Ms. Noble to discuss the results of ongoing  teacher-made assessments. On the basis of these discussions, the ENL teacher adjusts the curriculum and strategies for each  ELL student.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   ELLs are served according to the number of mandated minutes and program models set forth in CR Part 154.2 Our  entering and emerging  ELL students receive half ot heir 360 minutes of mandated ENL instruction in a stand-alone  program and half in an integrated program. The students at the transitioning level receive 180 minutes of ENL  instruction per week, half of the time using the integrated model of instruction and half of the time using the stand-  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44         alone model of instruction. Our students at the commanding level receive their 180 minutes per week in the  classroom, using the integrated model of instruction.  Commanding or former ELLs for two years after they have  exited ELL status receive  ENL support services for 90 minutes  per week in the integrated model of instruction.    All  students are in heterogeneous, age appropriate classes.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.        c.  DL program.  If applicable.         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Ms. Noble a certified ENL teacher delivers the mandated ENL minutes to all our ELLs. Former ELLs receive 90 minutes of ENL  instruction using the integrated model. Those scoring at the expanding level receive 180 minutes per week, also using the  integrated model of instruction. Students at the transitioning level receive 180 minutes of ENL instruction each week, 50% of  the time using the integrated model and 50% using the stand-alone model of instruction. Students at the entering and  emerging level receive 360 minutes of ENL instruction a week. The model of instruction for these programs is 50% integrated  and 50% stand-alone.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   All instruction is in English and is aligned with the Common Core Learning Standards. We use the Teachers College Reading and  Writing Program.  Scaffolding, modeling, developing background knowledge, and vocabulary instruction are all used to make  content comprehensible in all subject areas. To foster language for students needing further help, we use guided reading,  guided writing and multi-sensory word study. Shared experiences, interactive read-alouds, interactive writing, dramatizations,  chanting and singing songs, discussions and  answering open-ended questions all help to develop content and language  acquisition for the ELLs.  In mathematics, we use the Everyday Math program, which comes complete with manipulatives, games, student journals and  student workbooks. In addition, for second and third grade, experts come from the Salvadori  Center.  Through collaborative  hands-on, project-based learning and a scientific method of discovery, students learn the relevance of math and science to  their local community. They learn about and build bridges in second grade and skyscrapers in third grade.   In all grades, we use the FOSS science program, a research-based curriculum developed at the University of California at  Berkeley.  Visuals such as realia, pictures, videos, graphs, charts, globes, maps, graphic organizers all enrich and enable the  comprehension of the social studies curricula.The students in the integrated ENL program work in heterogeneous groups, thus  allowing the ELLs to learn with and from fluent English speakers.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   We do not have the tools to evaluate their progress in their home languages. However, we do allow ELLs to use glossaries and  dictionaries in their native language to help them comprehend content areas. We also try to place ELLs who share the  same home language in the same classroom.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      If we had a SIFE student, we would first ascertain his academic and social language abilities through formal and informal  assessments. The instruction would then be differentiated based on the proficiency level of the student.    For newcomers who just arrived we use TPR and stories with repetitive language like Brown Bear, Brown Bear What Do You  See?  After the students hear a few pages, they are able to join in. Newcomers are taught both social and academic  language.  We differentiate instruction by using texts with simpler vocabulary, while teaching the same content.     We use  realia, pictures and videos to help the ENL students understand content knowledge and develop  language acquisition.  We scaffold instruction based on the ELL's  current language acquisition to provide instruction that is rigorous, stretches their  understandings and develops language. Vocabulary is taught before students engage with new texts and concepts.  Newcomers read the texts in small guided reading groups. Newcomers, at first, answer questions using  a single word or  phrases.     Developing ELLs  are ELLs with 4-6 years of ENL instruction.  They know social English.  We concentrate on improving their  academic English through content area instruction. They read harder texts than the newcomers read.  They are  helped  to  speak and write in complete sentences and to use complex sentences appropriate to their level of language  acquisition.      We do not have long term ELLs (7 years or more) because our school serves grades pre-K through fifth grade. If we did,  we  would expect them to read texts independently, and be able to speak and write using complex sentences.     Former ELLs read more difficult  texts independently. They are given more complicated questions to answer orally and in  writing than the other ELLs.   They are expected to use more details in the fiction and non-fiction stories that they write.     For a description of materials, please see Question IV.a.3 above.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   The strategies that the ENL and classroom teachers use are: scaffolding, modeling, retelling, turn and talk, interactive read- alouds, interactive writing and questioning during each lesson to check for understanding. For materials, we use levelled  readers to differentiate instruction. Therefore each student is reading at their appropriate level. Each grade has  appropriate manipulatives and games to make mathematical concepts concrete. We use visuals, charts, realia, videos, just  right books, and science materials to help our ELL-SWDs learn academic content and develop English language proficiency. The  students are engaged in meaningful activities that promote purposeful English in all  four modalities.To accelerate English  language development, the students are involved in many cooperative projects. For example, the first grade does a unit on  restaurants. They visit restaurants. Then they cook a meal and serve it to their parents and staff. All the while, they use  academic language in describing their procedures, mathematical concepts in following recipes, organizing skills in writing a  menu, and decision-making skills in determining their roles in the enterprise.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Our ELL-SWDs are all placed in  the least restrictive environment  which in our school  is integrated co-teaching  classrooms.  The content area teacher and the special education teacher collaborate with each other and the ENL  teacher  to  make sure that the needs of the ELL-SWDs  are met.  If the ELL-SWD receives additional services such as speech,  counseling, occupational and/or physical therapy, we schedule these services at appropriate times that do not interfere with  academic instruction.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      All intervention is provided in English. All ELL-SWDs are served in ICT classrooms. Small group  or individualized instruction is  provided by the Special Education teacher and the ELL teacher. Newcomers are targeted for extra help in all content areas.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Presently, we are not considering any new programs.  Our current programs and curricula meet the needs of our ELLs.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N.A.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs participate in all school programs. They go on all school trips; they participate in the dance program with the National  Dance Institute; they attend class picnics and the fall and spring fairs; they participate in our after school programs. They are  totally integrated into the school.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  The students use books at their reading levels and math and science materials. They have access to classroom computers and  iPads  We use the software program BrainPopJr which has videos on topics the ELLs are learning about.  The ELLs use  Starfalls to help them with alphabet recognition and phonemic awareness. Starfalls also provides easy stories where the  students can select a word they can't read and the computer will read it.  The ELLs do research on the computers and on the  iPADs. Each science unit has its own hands-on materials. For example, the fifth grade students have materials to make their  own pendulums. The Everyday Math program has games, hands-on materials and workbooks for the students.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   We give students glossaries and dictionaries, when available, in their home language.  As much as possible, we try to develop  lessons that draw on the students' prior experiences and knowledge.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All ELLs are placed in age appropriate classes.  All support services such as speech are with students of their own age.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    We have our own building.      16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   The parent coordinator informs parents that they can choose to have a buddy parent to help them navigate the  school's  environment. Sharon Lustig assures them that as parent coordinator she is a resource for them. They are advised that there is  also a social worker they  can speak with if any problems occur. The parents are also told that the principal and assistant  principal are available as resources. In June, there is an orientation for all incoming kindergarten students.  In August there is a  picnic for all students with their families.   If an ELL enrolls during the school year, Ms Lustig will offer the parents the option to  have a buddy parent. If possible the student is placed in a class where another pupil speaks his home language.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    We are an elementary school that does not offer foreign language instruction.      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?              Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  We provide professional development  during our mandated PD meetings to all staff that works with ELLs. Best methods and  strategies to use at each stage of language acquisition are among the topics  addressed.      2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  The ENL teacher meets the mandated minimum requirement that 50% of her professional development hours address the  needs of ELLs by attending six-full day workshops offered by the Manhattan Field Support Center for ENL teachers. The  department of English Language Learner and Student Support also offers workshops for any teacher that is interested.  All  workshop attendance records  are kept in individual files in the main office.          Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   The ENL teacher calls or emails her students' parents to set up private meetings to discuss the students' language and  academic content area progress. Before the meeting, the ENL teacher and classroom teacher and other service providers  discuss the students' progress in all areas.  Data about students' from running records writing assessments and math  assessments are also explored at the meetings. At the meeting the parents are given a detailed description of how their child is  doing in all academic content areas and overall language development. When necessary, personnel from the Department of  Education's Translation and Interpretation Unit attend the meetings. The meetings are not held during the DOE-scheduled- parent-teacher conferences. They are also in addition to the mandated parent orientation meeting. If the parent cannot come  to the school, we have a telephone conversation.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   The Parent Coordinator encourages the parents to become involved in our school.  The social worker and the parent  coordinator give workshops for all parents, including parents of ENL students. Some of the topics are bullying; what to expect  in kindergarten; and sibling rivalry. Parents are encouraged to join the Parent Association. The parents of each grade are  invited to  breakfast meetings with  our principal, Mr. Parker.  Parents are encouraged to volunteer to go on class trips, work  on the school auction and attend performances and classroom special events, such as publishing parties and culmination  events.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, David Scott Parker, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PS 452                                                                              School DBN: 03M452  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
