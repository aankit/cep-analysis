This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      TSMS is a learning community with rigorous academic standards that honor individual learning styles and build skills  within a meaningful context.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      TSMS is a safe environment for early adolescents to discover and feel confident about who they are while building  nurturing and meaningful relationships with adults and peers.   TSMS is dedicated to fostering a community of ethical, caring, self-reflective, and critical thinkers.   TSMS celebrates the diversity of all its members and encourages them to express their individuality, pursue their  interests, analyze different points of view, and investigate questions about their world.       2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Tompkins Square Middle School was founded in 2001 with the goal of building a progressive   community that reflected the remarkable diversity of the Lower East Side neighborhood it would serve. Since that  year, Tompkins Square Middle School has grown into an award-winning and highly rated school that serves  approximately 360 students from NYC and all around the world.      In additional to a rich and rigorous academic program, Tompkins Square Middle School supports its students’  academic growth with outcomes-based assessment, academic coaching, and targeted small group instruction.  Tompkins Square Middle School supports its students’ social and emotional growth with an advisory curriculum. All  students study visual art and dance, and have extracurricular opportunities in athletics, the arts, and additional  academic support in partnership with Education Alliance’s after school program sited at Tompkins Square Middle  School.    Tompkins Square Middle School is currently focused on two major initiatives. This year our primary initiative is to    will be supporting teachers in developing culturally responsive curriculum school wide. The second initiative is  focused around social and emotional learning and developing a school wide behavior system with the framework of  Positive Behavior Intervention and Supports. This year brings a renewed focus to advisory infusing restorative  practices in all aspects of student and adult life throughout the school day. With the help of Expand Ed and TASC, we  are working to develop a school wide framework for behavior expectations. The goal is to develop these expectations  to create consistency across the school in all areas. In order to develop student and staff understanding, we plan to  bring together a group of staff members to create lessons and activities in advisory that help teach social and  emotional skills necessary for the success of this program.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Our student body is socio-economically, ethnically, racially, culturally, and academically diverse. Our founding vision is  based upon a belief that students learn best working closely together with other children who are different from  them in some way. Our community prides itself on being one of the most diverse secondary schools in this city,  including a complete range of academic ability and learning styles from students struggling to learn to read to some of  the top scholars in the city.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   TSMS uses a model of distributive leadership that builds an authentic common vision and true commitment from  staff. In the TSMS model of shared decision-making, all staff stakeholders have the opportunity to be involved in all  phases of school initiatives, from preliminary research and community outreach to the decision making,  implementation, and evaluation of new programs. This structure has lead to greater teacher investment in school  initiatives and more input and guidance on what is important to our school community. This model does present  some challenges around efficiency of decision making, community and consensus building, and coherence across  multiple simultaneous areas of community growth. However, the school community and leadership believe that the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10         shared decision making process leads to a community responsive to the needs of all stakeholders supported by an  extraordinarily deep level of professional commitment from staff.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 01M839   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   373   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Staff meets daily, weekly,  biweekly, and monthly in various configurations (i.e. whole staff, department level, advisory teams, grade level, co- teaching partnerships, small groups based around specific inquiry areas of interest, etc.) for professional  development. Our partnership with iZone360 also provides high quality ongoing professional development. In  addition, the school is safe, collaborative, and provides extensive supports for staff, as made clear in Progress Reports.

Teachers at TSMS are deeply involved in the decision-making process, including those decisions that concern  assessments. We utilize an innovative model of shared decision-making that is fairly unique in that all staff  stakeholders are involved in all phases of the decision, from preliminary research to the choice itself. Professional  development around assessment is conducted during monthly early dismissal afternoons.a        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. [School name], in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the  Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      [School name] will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

Community  Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and  family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in  Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health &  Wellness.    Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s)   How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student  academic outcomes?   Our school has well-established structures to ensure alignment of all stakeholders in working to achieve desired  results. The CSD and key CBO partners regularly attend SLT meetings along with teachers and parents to determine  school goals and programs. We coordinate the monthly CS Planning Team Meetings which include sub-committee  chairs ( i.e., achievement, youth services, attendance, parent engagement, health and mental health ) school staff,  parent representatives, CBO Supervisors, Parent Coordinator, etc. This team helps to streamline and implement  school/ community goals.       Through Expan Ed we will align expanded time with day school goals by focusing on developing skills connected to  common core (specifically STEM and literacy), critical thinking and to incorporate social and emotional learning into  each activity component. The time will also intentionally focus around the transition for 8th graders into 9th grade.      We will also focus on SEL, High school Transitions, and College Career Readiness     Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to  be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.    1. Staff will have participated in training and conversations around self-determined learning and culturally responsive  curriculum.   2. Panorama to measure SEL consensus of total school.   3. Engage at least 75% of parents into community activities.   4. By 2018 train all community school staff on restorative circles.

Community Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and  families feel welcome, actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of  their schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community  School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this family engagement  strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work.  Community School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director,  select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual  students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use.  Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work.   TSMS in collaboration with the lead CBO Educational Alliance has hired a Community School Director. The Director  will assist administration in the implementation of community school's four main pillars while conducting evidence  based assessment tools to track progress and success of students through their various partnerships.       The school supports students with issues of education, poverty, homelessness, chronic absenteeism and language  barriers. Although providing enrichment and wrap-around services, the school identified the need for Social  Emotional Learning aligned with supports for students. The school team explored program options and selected the  restorative justice circles curriculum from the Morningside Center for Social Responsibility. All day teachers and  afterschool staff are/will be versed be in the curriculum to support students in class, in small groups and individually.  A weekly meeting is set up where a team consisting of Social Workers, Parent Coordinator, Principal, Psychologist,  Guidance Counselors and other relevant staff meet to review students. In this meeting the team will go over referrals,  recommend services, and construct a plan to identify as well as meet the needs of our students.       Monthly Meetings will be held on the third Thursday of the month at 10:00am to: review and refine strategic plan,  identify challenges and solutions, assess the effectiveness of resources , identify new partners and resources and  assess effectiveness of academic support. Teachers, counselors and other school staff will present issues and work  with CBO planning team.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  In the fall, we print the results from the previous spring’s NYSESLAT. The students’ results are charted to analyze their progress  from the previous year’s assessments. These results are used to determine which students need more support in listening,  speaking, reading, and writing.  In addition, all students’ reading levels are assessed at the beginning, middle and end of the  year using the TCRWP reading assessments. We also do on-demand writing assessments for personal narratives and  essays.  Between the reading assessments and the writing assessments, we are able to create support groups for students who  need decoding, comprehension, grammar, punctuation, or writer’s craft support.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   We have schoolwide tracking documents to monitor student growth in all areas. In addition the ENL teacher has a separate  document for the ELs for tracking their progress in reading and the NYSESLAT over the years during which they are receiving  services. The ENL teacher shares the longitudinal EL tracking document with the pertinent teachers.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52         Our school also uses Jumprope, an online grading system. With this system, all teachers, students and parents can monitor  student growth in all academic areas.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The students do final projects in all subjects to show their growth and understanding in each area. These final projects are  scored with rubrics that the students have participated in designing and scoring. In this way the students are involved in  assessing their own progress and baselines for the following year. In addition, the TCRWP reading assessments at the end of  the year inform the following year’s teacher about baselines. The  NYSESLAT results are also used.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    For students who still need support with phonemic awareness and decoding, Fundations and Wilson small groups are formed.  For students who need support with comprehension, guided reading groups are formed.  Additionally, we have small group  support for math. Small groups are formed for punctuation or grammar during writing periods.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   TSMS uses the RTI framework to support all students who are not progressing in a certain area, academically or socially.  The  school has a PPT team that meets once a week to discuss student needs. The PPT team leader uses an RTI framework to  establish a goal to be met in about an eight week time period with descriptive data collection throughout the intervention to  monitor student growth.  When the ENL teacher works with a classroom teacher to develop small group support, the ENL  teacher uses a similar framework. The ENL teacher sets a goal for the group, collects anecdotal notes throughout the  intervention, meets with the classroom teacher to adjust goals and instruction as necessary, and then reports on  growth.  Typical interventions include Wilson phonics groups, vowel study groups, essay writing groups, or reading  comprehension groups focused on inferring or envisioning. When an intervention has ended, the teachers look at student  growth and decide if a deeper intervention or evaluation is needed. The teachers make the goals, data, and growth as  transparent as possible to the students so that they can own and monitor their progress. The students are very active in goal  setting and own the responsibility to improve.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The certified ENL teacher collects ATS reports to determine student scores on standardized testing in order to properly group  students according to their proficiency level.  The RLAT, the RLER, the RYOS, ROPB, and student assessment history reports are  all used to determine not only the overall score achieved on the NYSENLAT exam, but also the modalities in which students  scored the highest and lowest. Students are given running records, comprehension checks, and informal and formal  assessments that help to determine their literacy skills.    The classroom assessments that inform ENL instruction are the TCRWP running records and comprehension checks for  determining reading levels. The TCRWP reading assessments have demonstrated that all of the ENL students are below grade  level for reading.  The ENL teacher is supporting the students in reading by focusing on word families to help students decode  as they read. The ENL teacher is also using books at the students’ levels to support reading comprehension.  The teacher helps  students show comprehension by using graphic organizers for sequence of events, character traits and the problem and  solution.  The data from these assessments informs the classroom and ENL focus for the year.        The certified ENL teacher conducts informal and formal assessments regularly starting at the beginning of the year for  phonemic awareness, sight words, and comprehension depending on the level of the student.  Each student has an ENL  portfolio, which is carefully examined by the teacher three times a year to determine progress in areas such as written work,  spelling, grammar, decoding, reading comprehension, and vocabulary. Some ELs, even in middle school, are not yet secure in  their phonemic awareness and decoding skills so the ENL teacher has been conducting some small groups in the Wilson   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         program to strengthen the students’ foundations in literacy to then help them with fluency and reading comprehension at an  appropriate reading level for them.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Classroom teachers and the ENL teacher work together to complete schoolwide documents that track student progress. The  ENL also shares the ELs’ progress in the NYSESLAT. When the ENL teacher meets with the classroom teachers for planning, this  data is considered. Classroom teachers collaborate with the ENL teacher to differentiate instruction based on student needs.  The ENL teacher is using this data to place these students in small groups for targeted instruction in certain listening skills like  note taking and restating information from information gap games, as well as reading and writing skills, like inferencing, or  providing specific examples in essay writing.  The ENL teacher shares this data with the classroom teachers so that students  can receive additional, targeted support in the classroom as well.  Classroom assistants, reading volunteers, and student  teachers are also instructed on how to support these students in the specific areas that have come up from the assessments.           Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   As per CR Part 154.2 students receive 360 minutes of instruction per week by the certified ENL pedagogue if they are  entering or emerging in integrated and stand alone formats. Students receive 180 minutes of ENL instruction per  week if they are transitioning and expanding in integration with the ELA instruction in the classroom and stand  alone.  Students receive two periods of push-in ENL instruction a week if they are in the first two years after scoring a  commanding level. At times the ENL teacher and general classroom teachers, during co-planning, will decide that the  students need extra intervention outside of the classroom and the ENL teacher will conduct a pull-out ENL lesson in  order to address more specific areas of English language development. Instruction is delivered by the ENL teacher in a  small group.  The ENL teacher teaches a mini-lesson to the students about speaking, listening, reading, or writing and  then the students carry out independent practice of the skill taught.     The students are grouped mostly heterogeneously in grade level groups. In 6th grades, the students travel to all their  classes together.  In 7th and 8th, the els will be together for Humanities to allow for push in and pull out, but might be  separated for Math and Science. The opposite might also happen, in which the ELs are together for Math and Science  for push in services and then in parallel Humanities classes for pull out services. This arrangement changes depending  on the needs of the group.     When schedules allow we may group together students who are the same proficiency levels and have the same  learning needs, but are different grade levels. For example, we have a student who is entering the 8th grade, but is  reading and comprehending on a third grade level. If the schedules allow it, we may decide to group the 8th grader  with other 6th graders who are reading at that level so that he will be able to participate in a reading group (since  none of the other students in the 8th grade class are reading at that level).   b.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   The ENL groupings are heterogeneous, as grade levels and proficiency may vary within a group, however students are always  grouped with others that are on or close to their proficiency or grade level. Many factors are looked at with extreme  consideration when grouping the students, including language proficiency, age, academic needs, and class schedule.  Students  receive 90 minutes of ELA instruction each day in their classrooms. The ENL teacher integrates ENL instruction into the general  education classroom to support the literacy work that is happening in the classroom.  At times, the ENL teacher will also  integrate ENL instruction during math, science, or social studies in order to support English language development in these  content areas as well.  The ENL teacher never conducts stand alone ENL lessons during specialty classes so this often influences  the group members, but the group members are still matched as closely as possible with English level and age within the  schedule.    As mandated by their NYSITELL or NYSENLAT score, students receive 360 minutes of instruction per week by the certified ENL  pedagogue if they are entering or emerging. Students receive 180 minutes of ENL instruction per week if they are transitioning  or expanding.  Students receive two periods of Integrated ENL instruction weekly if they are commanding. The ENL teacher  creates a schedule in order to meet groups of students at all levels for the required amount of time. This schedule is created in  accordance with the classroom schedule to ensure that the students are receiving their mandated ENL and ELA. The certified  ENL teacher works closely with the classroom teachers and school administration to develop an Integrated schedule which will  benefit student learning.       Since we use a blended model of both integrated ENL services and stand alone services, we ensure that all students receive 90  minutes of ELA instruction every day. ELs receive between 30 and 60 minutes of ENL instruction in addition.  During stand  alone ENL services, students receive scaffolded reading and writing instruction in the ENL classroom and to help students learn  the academic language functions and vocabulary necessary to access the common core curriculum.     We do not explicitly teach the students’ home language since we have such a wide variety of languages spoken at our school.  However, we always ask students to make connections between what we are learning in school and what they already know  about the same topic in their first language. We also have a variety of books in many home languages so that students can  continue to read in their first language if they are literate in the home language.  We encourage parents to borrow these books  to read with their children. We also have glossaries available in every classroom for students to translate between the home  language and English in their academic subjects.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   The ENL teacher provides instruction in Balanced Literacy (phonics support, shared reading, shared writing, writing and  reading workshops, guided reading), Math, Social Studies, Science, and English Language development. The students are  taught with sound ENL teaching practices such as scaffolding, modeling, and conferring. The types of scaffolding that are used  in Earth School stand alone ENL program includes modeling, bridging (ex.: Think-Pair-Share), contextualization (ex.: self- assessment, reciprocal teaching). Authentic literature, thematic units and author studies are a large focus in the ENL  classroom. In addition, there are a wide range of books that target each grade and language level.     In all subject areas, in connection with the common core, the students explore complex text structure to analyze how language  works in different genres and subject areas.  The ENL teacher uses sentence frames to help the students break apart complex  paragraphs to follow what is happening and what is the connection between each sentence in a paragraph.  The students also  look at what choices authors make as writers across content areas, so that the students can make those same choices as  writers. The ENL teacher models the use of academic language functions to support ELs in reading independently in English  and to be able to express their understanding in English using correct academic English.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      Students are taught in a language-rich classroom where there are ample instructional materials, books, and English language  learning games that address and strengthen the needs of each student at each grade level. For example, in Math, the teachers  use manipulatives and math games to support students with learning complex concepts. The ENL teacher makes vocabulary  barrier games to support the ELs, and all other students, in learning Social Studies and Science vocabulary and concepts.     For literacy, for those students who have been in the country less than three years, some of the books used during the ENL  program are provided in the students’ native language to supplement comprehension. These newcomers are allowed to bring  the book in their native language home the night prior to class reading in order to provide a background understanding of the  text to be covered in class. Students practice reading strategies such as identifying cause and effect, author’s purpose,  sequencing, inferring, main idea and supporting details, and character analysis during independent reading or guided reading  groups.  This will provide the students opportunities to identify and practice using the strategies outside their mainstream  classroom.  There is a strong focus on non-fiction materials so that students learn to analyze, connect, predict and understand  real-world topics from sources such as magazines, newspapers, the internet, and reference books.       In the ENL and mainstream classrooms, leveled classroom libraries are used for independent and guided reading activities.  Students are exposed to rich language, strong story patterns and vocabulary levels that extended student schema.  Instruction  is designed to target the needs of ELLs, especially in the areas of reading.  Units are planned in alignment with state standards  and classroom content so that students can hone skills they need for success in the classroom as well as success on state  tests.  For example, if the students are working on reading and writing personal narratives in the classroom, there will be  additional instruction in the ENL Standalone environment which will focus on helping students to access the language of  personal narrative stories, and provide vocabulary support and reading strategies to improve students understanding of the  topic.     The certified ENL teacher employs the Teachers College Reading and Writing Project Method for lesson plan format in order to  design individual lessons as well as units of study.  In this manner, students’ growing reading skills are always supported by  both a language and content objective in each lesson, and students always have an opportunity to learn, practice, and  synthesize the new skills learned.  Scaffolded instruction includes background building, vocabulary support, language  objectives, independent and group practice, and the opportunity to synthesize learning as well as assessment.  The New York  State English as a Second Language learning standards are applied to all lessons. In the ENL and general education classroom,  leveled classroom libraries are used for independent and guided reading activities. Students are exposed to rich language,  strong story patterns and vocabulary levels that extend student schema.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   Our school does not use native language assessments throughout the year with the exception of the Spanish LAB-R for  incoming Spanish speaking ELs.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status       SIFE  There are no SIFE students at TSMS currently, but we would made programmatic choices so that ENL instruction supports the  students’ academic and social needs.  SIFE students would learn reading and writing with students at the same reading level  for a couple of sessions a week, but the students also participate in talking/listening activities with students that are the same  age.  The licensed ENL teacher and the classroom teacher would create a plan that supports the students in developing social  skills in English in order to make friendships with peers. At the same time the two teachers work together to create a curricular  plan that ensures that the students can catch up in the necessary academics in order to keep up with the appropriate grade  level to the best of their abilities.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56         Newcomer  For ELLs who have been in US schools for less than three years, there is even greater consideration and supplemental  techniques, strategies and scaffolding used during instruction. These students are often given more individualized support and  instruction to help meet their educational needs. We often provide Ipads and glossaries to support newcomers with  translation opportunities to learn new vocabulary.  The ENL teacher works with the newcomers during reading and writing in  order to support these students in developing phonemic awareness and the decoding skills, building vocabulary, determining  new vocabulary in context. envisioning as we read, and writing for clarity.       Our goal is to support the newcomer students so that they develop the ability to socialize with peers, build lasting friendships,  participate in class, and develop independence in reading with comprehension and writing for an audience so that all  newcomers are known members of the community.  In order to include our newcomers, they also engage in collaborative  group work and cooperative learning experiences that promote problem-solving and accountable talk. ELLs are immersed in  lessons that provide explicit instruction in the structure of English, background building, knowledge, vocabulary and oral  language.     Developing     For our students who have received ENL services for 4-6 years, the ENL teacher provides more support with academic  language and language functions. These students typically know basic English vocabulary, but they need to learn tier 2 and 3  words to participate and be independent with class readings and conversations.  This year we are focusing on vocabulary  development tied to listening skills by envisioning and note taking to figure out words most likely mean.  These students need  help with grammar, as well, so that as their sentences become longer and more complex, their grammar reflects the growing  sophistication of their writing.     Long Term     Since it often takes 7-10 years for students to develop academic competency in a second language, it is understandable that  some of our ELL students have been receiving services for over 6 years. Most likely these students need help with  understanding the advanced course content that comes at the middle school level.  The school has an academic intervention  team, which examines the need for further targeted instruction in content areas, as well as whether or not the student  requires special attention from a certain staff member or special accommodation in the classroom.  Between the combined  efforts of the support team and the pupil personnel team, student learning challenges are identified early and various  strategies and groupings are applied to meet these needs.  For example the student may receive targeted instruction in math  concepts or math vocabulary, they may have access to CD players with stories read aloud for further practice, or they may  partake in reader’s theater groups to help with a variety of literacy challenges.  The ENL teacher continues to see the ENL  student, supporting the content area curricula with scaffolds and modified directions/projects. Additionally, the ENL teacher  works with the classroom teachers to modify the curriculum and grading policies for these students.     Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status     Students who pass the NYSESLAT continue to receive Integrated ENL services for 90 minutes per week and special  accommodations during testing for two years.  The ENL teacher visits the classroom twice weekly and supports the former ENL  student with classroom curriculum in the areas in which those students still need support. Using the NYSESLAT test scores, TC,  Words Their Way, and Math assessments, the classroom and ENL teachers work together to schedule Integrated periods  during subjects in which the students need support. In addition, the ENL teacher is in communication with the former ELLs and  their classroom teacher in order to determine throughout the year whether the student continues to need support in certain  aspects of language development.  The ENL teacher provides resources for lesson planning, scaffolding, and vocabulary  support to the classroom teacher so that former ELLs are still provided with the necessary tools to access information as their  language continues to grow.   The ENL teacher provides graphic organizers, vocabulary supports, texts at the appropriate  reading level, scaffolded tests and classroom worksheets.  The ENL teacher also makes sure that the student is able to work   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      independently and in group activities in the classroom by providing the above mentioned supports.  When the student is able  to reach grade level standards in class independently, ENL support is no longer necessary.       6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   When LEP students are identified as having special needs or disabilities, they work in small reading groups with the SETSS  teacher in addition to ENL services.  These students might also work on the Wilson Reading program, for example.  Teachers at  TSMS carefully determine appropriate reading and mathematical levels for ELLs-SWDs so as to support them while teaching at  an individualized pace for them. Classroom teachers are sensitive to the learning styles of ELLs-SWDs and implement  interventions for these students in their classrooms. Some interventions include the use of pictures to support language,  allowing students to write and speak in their first language while learning English, as to build their confidence and allow them  to learn English in a more natural way at their own pace. Teachers often use graphic organizers with ELL students, as well as  incorporate peer tutoring and conferencing throughout the school day. TSMS also allows teachers to have access to many  resources which helps support ELL students; learning, such as books on tape, leveled libraries, vocabulary and spelling  resources, and technology. Having these structures in place allow all students to thrive academically.     The ENL teacher continues to develop the students’ English speaking, listening, reading, and writing skills by using  developmentally appropriate texts and activities. The ENL teacher will use picture cards and big books to help develop  speaking and listening skills.  To develop reading and writing skills, the teacher uses books that are appropriate for the  students’ reading level and the ENL teacher supports the students in correcting the grammacticality of their classroom  writing.  The ENL teacher will also support the LEP students with disabilities in answering writing prompts to ensure that the  answers follow correct English syntax and grammar to make sense. When there are LEP students with physical disabilities, the  ENL teacher makes whatever appropriate changes in setting and instructional methods to support the students’ ability to learn  the information being delivered.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  All of our students with disabilities are now being served in ICT classrooms, and this includes our ELs with disabilities.  The ENL  teacher pushes in to or pulls out of those classrooms as the schedule allows, just like with the general education ELs.  The ENL  teacher works with the IEP team and uses the IEP to set instructional goals for EL students with disabilities. All of the rich  curriculum that has been previously described applies for our SWDs that are ELs, with the necessary accommodations to help  them participate and access the content to demonstrate understanding. The ENL teacher uses a balanced literacy program  with ENL/SWDs students in order to connect to the classroom work of reading at their “just right” level. The ENL teacher  supports the Writing Workshop by helping students focus on making the writing they have done in class understandable for  their readers.  The ENL teacher has also created more picture/word games to develop student speaking skills in English as well  as word family workbooks to support the ENL students with decoding skills for reading and spelling.  We are working to  minimize pull-out ENL programs in favor of push-in programs.  We are doing this so that the students spend less time out of  the classroom and so that the students can focus on targeted English skills through the classroom curriculum. The ENL teacher  is also using the Wilson Phonics program for the ELs that are still struggling with reading fluency and comprehension because  their foundation in English phonics is not strong enough to support advancing to higher reading levels yet.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  ELLs receive Integrated services in literacy, math, social studies and science.  As language educators, we know that academic  proficiency can take 7-10 years, long after the student is speaking fluently English. Often an ELL's needs in the core academic  areas can be overlooked, but the student is still struggling to express his/her understanding of complicated academic topics in  English.  The ENL teacher works with the classroom teacher to modify the academic content and assessments in order to allow  the ELLs the maximum opportunity for success.  Students are taught in a language-rich classroom where there are ample  instructional materials, books, and English language learning games that address and strengthen the needs of each student at   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      each grade level. For example, in Math, the teachers use manipulatives and math games to support students with learning  complex concepts. The ENL teacher makes vocabulary barrier games to support the ELs, and all other students, in learning  Social Studies and Science vocabulary and concepts. Additionally, almost all classrooms have a student teacher, aide, or  reading support volunteer so that our ELLs can have a lot of individualized attention in the classroom. These services are  always provided in English at Earth School, as we only have a freestanding ENL program available.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      The 2017 NYSESLAT scores demonstrate that all the ELs did well in the Speaking test. Students were able to explain their  thinking verbally by adding their own ideas.  These results show us that an integrated model of ENL instruction has been and  continues to be beneficial for the students to learn content area vocabulary and communicate their learning with their peers.  Most of the ELs did very well in Listening, but not as well as speaking. So the ENL teacher will continue to work with the ELs in  participating in the classroom instruction through developing better strategies for listening and following directions in an  Integrated model for half of the service minutes. The results of the NYSESLAT showed the that 6, 7, and 8 students still need  support with independence in reading comprehension and grammatically correct writing. The ENL teacher will continue to  provide more targeted scaffolds for reading and writing in a Standalone model for half of the service minutes so that the ELs  can more clearly and independently express their thinking following conventional English rules in writing. Six students  demonstrated a commanding level on the 2017 NYSESLAT so we feel pleased to see that students are making progress.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We never had a bilingual program.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All ENL students are invited to participate in all extracurricular activities and clubs during and after school just like any other  student. To ensure that families are aware of all the programs offered, these flyers are also sent home in the native language  when possible.  Also the parent coordinator and ENL teacher can provide translators for parent questions about these  activities.  In this way they are able to develop their social skills and social language for further success.  Many of our ELs  participate in after school sports, homework help, and clubs.  Additionally, we have a talent show and a cultural celebration  day with fashion shows, poetry readings, and dance performances in which all of our students proudly participate.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  TSMS has a large collection of books for our ENL students to read at their levels.  The ENL library also has many high interest,  low level books for students to read in pairs or groups.  We have pictures cards, cubes, blocks, and foam letters for our  newcomer students as well.  We also have manipulatives for math exploration.  There is a strong focus on technology at  TSMS.  Students have access to laptops, which are used in their classrooms for typing instruction, internet based research, and  writing reports.  Technology employed in the ENL classroom includes computers with internet access for online research, audio  CD’s for listening activities, and phonics development through listening games on tape.  Students are given opportunities to  access websites in teacher guided lessons that require research, especially on non-fiction topics.  Furthermore, students listen  to audio recordings of books and work on projects in which they record and listen to their own voice.  The goal is to increase  fluency and work on listening skills, especially listening for information and understanding. We use Ipads and chrome books to  help with translation and to reinforce English grammar, spelling/phonics, and punctuation rules through interactive games.     We have a wide range of materials available to support the students' language and developmental needs at all levels.  We have  several baskets of books at different reading levels  for listening centers with books on cd and sets of cd players that would be  interesting to different age, maturity, interest, and reading levels.  We have many big books and books from many genres, like  non-fiction, fantasy, mystery, alphabet, and realistic fiction books. We also use internet resources that support the classroom  curriculum.  We have several laptop carts in the building for students to do online research on topics of their interest.  We  support developing literacy with websites like tumblebooks or Reading A-Z in which the students can read online, choosing  from a wide range of online books.  The library also has a variety of reading materials for all levels and interests.  The ENL  teacher uses all of these resources to help the students with their classroom curriculum at each level.  For example, the ENL  teacher uses A-Z books for all grade levels, but uses increasingly more complex books for the groups that are more advanced in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      English.  The ENL teacher uses laptops for internet research for the students that are capable.  The ENL teacher finds several  websites that support the classroom subject matter.  To support students with independent reading, the ENL teachers uses the  website Childrens Library so that students can read books online in their native language as well as books in English.  The ENL  teacher also, for example, found websites for the sixth grade students about biomes to help the students experience what the  subject was about with more visual supports on the websites.  The ENL teacher also found websites to support eighth grade  students learning about WWII.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?      TSMS currently only has a freestanding ENL program, but the ENL teacher sends home letters and informational flyers in the  home language.  Additionally, students are encouraged to continue developing literacy in the home language at home, and the  ENL teacher sends books home in the home language. The ENL department has books in Spanish to help students continue  development in Spanish at home and in school.  The ENL department is looking to buy books in more languages that are  represented in our school like Chinese, Arabic, Bengali and Tibetan.  Additionally, the students are encouraged to bring books  from home in their home language to share with the class.  The ENL teacher celebrates Home Language week, in which the  students read a book from their native language to the class to teach the class about their home language and culture and help  the students empathize with what it is like to listen to a story in a language other than your primary language.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    The required services support and correspond with ELs’ ages and grade levels because we are doing grade level work.  While  the students may be reading independently at a just right level that is below grade level, they are still participating in class read  alouds, shared readings, and content material at grade level.  Grade level texts may be modified, but students are still held  accountable and supported in learning grade level vocabulary and content. Students participate in all enrichment classes with  their peers so that they are learning age approrpriate skills in art, physical education, dance, and technology.         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?       Our building has three schools.  The ENL teacher works in one elementary school as well as the middle school in the building.  The ENL teacher is able to use books at an appropriate reading level for any studeny by sharing resources between the two  schools. In addition, all three schools share a library which has wonderful resources to support classroom curricula. All three  schools share the cafeteria, gymnasium, and recess yard equitably. The ELs are able to work with guidance counselors and use  technology as needed, just like any other student. Since we have a large number laptops, the computers are available to any  class in the building (all three schools have their own sets of laptops) whenever they need.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Prior to the beginning of the school year, the parent coordinator communicates with parents of newly registered ELLs.  Parents  come to the school for a tour and an orientation meeting. Students are given the opportunity before school to tour the  classrooms, meet the teachers, and familiarize themselves with the school environment. For students who arrive at the  beginning of the year or in the middle of the year, the guidance counselor runs a group for new students. In addition, current  students conduct tours and act as buddies to help the new students get to know the school building, routines, and other  children.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Tompkins Square Middle School only offers Spanish.  All students take Spanish.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   n/a     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The ENL teacher attends MFSC, TC, or DELLSS professional development sessions that will support the ELs and teachers with  their classroom content and language learning.    The ENL teacher also meets with the staff for one hour every Monday after school and participates in professional  development.  During these meetings, the ENL teacher contributes important information about appropriate expectations for  beginning, intermediate, and advanced ENL students at different age levels. The ENL teacher provides professional  development about scaffolds and accommodations that can be made per grade level to help ENL students be independently  successful in the classroom curriculum. The ENL teacher works closely with classroom teachers in small groups on topics such  as goal setting for students, content area support, differentiation, and curriculum development. Classroom teachers are also  provided information on Professional Development opportunities for all teachers of ELLs, including general education  classroom teachers.  For example, the science teacher may be informed of a ELL Science symposium and given the option to  attend an event along with the ELL teacher.  As the ENL teacher attends professional development events, the information  gathered at those events is turn-keyed at the school level and shared with teachers.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  The entire staff is focusing on using academic outcomes to support students with mastery of classroom content. The ENL  teacher has participated in team and committee meetings about the school curriculum to also focus on supports in academic  language so that ELs and SWDs can be successful with the Common Core classroom curriculum.  PD sessions will also be  dedicated to differentiation and inclusion to support student mastery of outcomes. These prefessional development sessions  will help the teachers in supporting ELLs and general education students. The ENL teacher has attended DELLSS and network  meetings designed for supporting ELs with academic language in increasingly complex texts.  The ENL teacher always has the  support of the adminsitration to attend any professional development sessions that will help in supporting ELs with the  Common Core. The ENL teacher also participates in school based meetings and PD sessions pertaining to the Common Core.     TSMS staff meets every Monday afternoon from 2:30 – 3:30.  Half of these meetings are designated for professional  development, while the other half are devoted to grade level meetings.  The entire staff is focusing on aligning expectations  across the grades.  During these meetings, the ENL teacher contributes important information about appropriate expectations  for beginning, intermediate, and advanced ENL students at different age levels. The ENL teacher provides professional  development about scaffolds and accommodations that can be made per grade level to help ENL students be independently  successful in the classroom curriculum. The ENL teacher works closely with classroom teachers in small groups on topics such  as goal setting for students, content area support, differentiation, and curriculum development. Classroom teachers are also  provided information on Professional Development opportunities for all teachers of ELLs, including general education  classroom teachers.  For example, the science teacher may be informed of a ELL Science symposium and given the option to  attend an event along with the ELL teacher.  As the ENL teacher attends professional development events, the information  gathered at those events is turn-keyed at the school level and shared with teachers.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61         As part of the 15% hours, the ENL teacher has given demonstrations to the entire staff about the NYSITELL assessment as well  as the NYSENLAT so that the staff understands how the ENL students are assessed.  The ENL teacher also conducts a mini  lesson in another language that the staff does not understand (Arabic) so that the teachers can empathize with the experience  of learning a second language simultaneously with new subject matter.  This helps the teachers develop scaffolds like visual  cues for the minilesson. The ENL teacher also plans to give a workshop on ways that classroom teachers can support the  students in general education settings.  Many teachers also attend workshops about interventions for students who are  learning English as a Second Language. For example, all the Special Education teachers and the ENL teacher attended  workshops about RTI in order to assist the students with interventions before these students get referred for Special Education  services.    Teachers are also provided support throughout the year on an individual basis.  The ENL teacher works with classroom  teachers to determine teaching strategies, discuss language development, set goals for individual students, and incorporate  new teaching ideas into the classroom that will help to differentiate learning for ENL students. Teachers have access to ELL  specific materials from the ENL classroom library and the ENL teacher’s library of materials.  There is an ENL binder of  resources in the UFT teacher center for lesson planning and instruction, as well as ideas for teaching math, literature, social  studies and other content areas to ENL students. Furthermore, the ENL attends monthly ENL network meetings.  Topics include  the language of mathematics for ELLS, differentiation, and lesson planning.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   The ENL teacher meets with all families of ELs at the beginning of the year to discuss the students’ progress in listening,  speaking, reading, and writing based on NYSESLAT scores and classroom assessments. In addition, the ENL teacher is present at  all Parent Teacher Conferences and IEP meetings so that the parents receive their mandated ENL progress meeting at the same  time as the Parent Teacher Conferences.    Results from the NYSESLAT are used to discuss student progress with parents at the beginning of the year as part of ther  mandated ENL progress meeting. This information is also shared with the ELs’ teachers. Students who continue to receive ENL  instruction due to a failure to pass the NYSENLAT receive specialized instruction in the four components of listening, speaking,  reading, and writing in order to improve English performance for self sufficiency in all academic areas.  Rachel Levinsky is the  only licensed ENL teacher administering the NYSENLAT. Every year in the spring, the licensed ENL teacher administers the  NYSENLAT (the New York State English as a Second Language Achievement Test).  The ENL teacher first administers the  Listening and Speaking sections of the test within the testing date window.  The ENL teacher gives the test individually or in  small groups depending on the test directions.  The test is administered in a quiet location, like the school library to help the  students focus.  The Reading and Writing portions are then administered during the testing window.  Again, students are  grouped or individually given the test depending on test directions. Students in groups are always seated in a way to minimize  distractions from others, but close enough to the teacher to hear all directions.  The ENL teacher grades the test results  according to the rubrics provided with a committee. The results from this test inform the school of the students' progress in  listening, speaking, reading, and writing.  These results inform our curricular and grouping decisions for the next year to best  meet the students' needs. If students pass the listening/speaking components but still struggle in reading/writing, the ENL  teacher works with the students more on reading and writing.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.      Parents are an integral part of the TSMS community.  In order to include all parents in school activities, meetings, and projects,  information is sent home in the native language so that parents of ELLs can participate. Parents have weekly Parent  Association meetings with the Principal.  Parents also participate in weekly community open work sessions in the classroom, in  which parents work with their children on projects of their choosing. This particular weekly activity is excellent for the parents  of the ELL students because then they can see what the classroom expectations and projects are so that the ELL parents can      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62         support them at home.  Many parents conduct projects with their childrens’ classes, like art projects or environmental studies  projects. Parents help plan and facilitate a wide variety of community activities such as the fall fair, community potluck, clubs  within the school and open “mic” nights.  Parents are involved in the school’s environmental endeavors and serve on the  boards of the nutrition committee, the rooftop garden committee, and a variety of other school based groups. TSMS makes  consistent efforts to reach out to parents on a regular basis that goes far beyond the required parent conferences throughout  the year.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Sonhando Estwick, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Tompkins Square Middle School                                                                              School DBN: 839  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Parents come to school with their children at the beginning of the school year. At this time, parents are  interviewed by the licensed ENL pedagogue, Rachel Levinsky, as well as the parent coordinator, Shirley Lee Wong.  There is one certified ENL teacher at TSMS who administers the Home Language Survey. The teacher’s license and  certification is on file at the school. Interviews are conducted in the native language or in English with the parent  and child while filling out the Home Language Survey. Parents are given a Home Language Information Survey to  find out if the student speaks a language other than English.We also use RLAT and other ATS reports to inform us  of students' home language when tey transfer to our school from within NYC. Since we only have 350 students, it  is easy for us to maintain close relationships with parents and gather this information informally as well as  through the emergency cards. We also have intake night in which parents talk to the students' advisor about any  concerns and any other information they think is important for the child's success. All student biographical  information is entered into Jumprope, our online grading system, where teachers can learn necessarry  information about a student to help with communication and learning.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66       2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     Language    Spanish, Chinese (Mandarin and  Cantonese), Bengali, Arabic, Tibetan,  Russian, Italian, Hebrew   Written  Preferred    Percent  Written    3%   Spanish,  Chinese,  Bengali,  Arabic   Oral Preferred    Percent Oral    6%   Spanish,  Chinese  (Mandarin and  Cantonese),  Bengali, Arabic,            3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.     NONE          Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services    1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be   distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.

For  the forms that are not already translated, we will send them to the  translation unit two weeks before the letters are sent home to all the  students.    September   November   March   June           translate?   Include   procedures  to ensure   timely   provision of  translated  documents  to parents.    We submit  the  documents  to the DOE  translation  unit at least  two weeks  prior to the  distribution  date.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67     2.  List the formal face-to-face meetings your school will typically have with parents throughout the school year, such as   parent-teacher   conferences or curriculum nights, when they will occur, and plans to provide interpretation at those meetings.        Meeting Name    Month/Frequency   of Meetings    How does  your school   We have Intake Night, parent teacher conferences three times a year,  IEP meetings for students with special needs, and meetings with  parents whenever they request them.

We have  interpreters  available who  speak  Mandarin,  Cantonese,  Spanish,  Bengali, and  Arabic for  Parent  Teacher  Conferences  and Intake  Night.           3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      In the event of a school emergency, we will use the over the phone interpretation service to contact families. Most of  our students also have cell phones so we will give permission to students to call their families.            Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure    Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      The staff receives training at after school professional development meetings on Mondays from 2:35-3:55. The LAC  has also created a document that has been shared with the staff for how to get documents translated with the DOE  translation services and how to use the over the phone interpretation service.             Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68           Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)   The posters that were sent from the city are posted with the security desk and the main office and are also in the ENL  teacher's office so that any staff member can determine a parents' home language and then use the over the phone  interpretation hotline. When we send home flyers for school events, we include information that translators will be  available. In fact, we have the parents sign up for appointments and we line up the translators to be available for  those appointments.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       We have internal parent surveys that we review. We also have parent representatives on the school SLT to help us  maintain the parent perspective in any school decision.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69
