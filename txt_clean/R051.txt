The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7     In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           8       NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           10      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Mission Statement:   Section 4: SCEP Overview      At I.S. 51 we are dedicated to fostering academic excellence for all students. We will do this by setting high  expectations for the academic success of all learners. Our goal is to prepare students to advance their education  towards college and career readiness. To this end, we will provide a nurturing and safe learning environment that  promotes respect for all cultures in our diverse population. Through positive relationships and collaboration, we will  engage our students to become productive citizens and future leaders.                            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   It is our belief that if teachers know their students and clearly communicate the criteria for success towards standard  mastery, then students will be engaged in appropriately rigorous curriculum and able to self-assess and articulate  their next steps    During the 2017-2018 school year, our school worked closely with the UFT Teacher’s Center to bring assessment  focused professional development to our teachers. We participate in the Middle School Quality Initiative and as a  result have a Strategic Reading period built into the day to support all readers. During the 2017-2018 school year, we  utilized this time to teach reading with the READ 180 program to students in 12:1 and 12:1:1 classes. The Writing  Revolution is being utilized in ELA, SS, and Science classes to support students’ in understanding and communicating  complex concepts. The math department worked closely with National Training Network to support teachers in  implementing the SOLVE strategy and focused on including the conceptual understanding of math into lessons and  unit plans. Using the data from the 2016-2017 school year, we saw a need for a social emotional initiative thus  during the 2017-2018 school year, we began to use Restorative Circles in some classrooms and created a Peer  Mediation program for all students that would complement the Mentor-Mentee program currently in place.          3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           11         Our school is comprised of 1330 students. The ethnic breakdown is 45% Hispanic, 26% White and 24% Black and 5%  other. Students with disabilities account for 33% of our population while 12% are English Language Learners. We are  currently utilizing focused reading and writing programs that will support students who are below or approaching  grade level.    In the 2017-2018 school year, students with disabilities were 2.84% more likely to be suspended than their non- disabled peers. In 2018-2019, 67% of students with disabilities achieved a proficiency level of 1 on the ELA State  Exam and 79.6% achieved a proficiency level of 1 on the Math State Exam. The data suggests a correlation between  the academics challenges and behavior of students with disabilities.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   During the 2017-2018 school year we focused on creating a supportive environment for students through instituting  Restorative Circles in classrooms, providing a safe place for students to work out conflicts in Peer Mediation,  implementing READ 180 for a small group of targeted students who needed reading intervention, expanding our  work with The Writing Revolution to systematically support learners communicate complex concepts, and utilizing  the SOLVE strategy to support all learners in math. As a result, incident reports and the number of students being  suspended multiple times decreased. This year we are deepening these practices by implementing the Social  Emotional program NaliniKIDS. The philosophy of the program is when students are physically connected, they are  comfortable, confident, and energized to listen and engage in learning. The program is targeting a small population  of students who need support with both academics and behavior. We have expanded the READ 180 program to  include a larger population of students and added System 44 to support students who need phonics. We continue to  deepen the teacher's pedagogy with The Writing Revolution and the SOLVE strategies respectively through focused  professional development and collaborative common planning time.                 2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           12      School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 31R051   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08,SE   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   1315   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   YES   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

According to the 2016-17 Quality Review data and the current 17-18 state scores were we have seen a 5% increase in  the number of students that are Proficient in ELA and 2% increase in those proficient in Math. Even though we have  seen these gains we still have work to do. We are continually re-evaluating how we teach the CCLS and ensure that  teachers provide multiple access points to students based upon data. Teachers use multiple formative and summative  assessment but do not routinely analyze the data they collect in teams to inform instruction and often the assessments  are content-based, not CCLS aligned. Many teachers share the implications or meaning of the formative and summative  assessments is it relates to the standard, with the students. The practice should be common and sustainable for all  teachers. For some of our most struggling students we are utilizing the STARI, Read 180 and System 44 program.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           44        Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds.

The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Edward Markham I.S. 51, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A  of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      Edward Markham I.S. 51 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           46      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  IS 51 uses Performance Series Scantron for entire school, DRP testing and Running Records TCRWP for our ELL population. IS  51 also uses the ELL Periodic Assessment to drive classroom instruction. Read 180 and Lightsail are also used for proficiency  and phonics.  All types of assessments further differentiate instruction by using the scale scores outlined by the NYSESLAT  coupled by the ELL Learning Standards. In analyzing the subgroup of the NYSESLAT results, student performance varies in each  modality and in each grade.  However, it clearly highlights the need to develop the listening and reading in general while  identifying speaking as its area of strength.  It is through the formation of the Language Allocation Policy Team that it is hoped  that these valuable data be shared to other teachers of ELLs within the school community.  This is done once again through       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           58      department and grade level meetings at the same time being a critical indicator to the Academic Intervention Team in the  middle school level.  We also provide all teachers of ENL students with native language glossaries.   The Dual Language program currently utilizes the Degrees of Reading Power assessment to assess students literacy skills. Less  formative assessments are through teacher observations, and teacher-student conferences. The data collected helps indicate  the various struggles students may have in regards to phonics, fluency and/or comprehension. The information is used for  grouping, differentiation and to guide instruction.        2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   We will continue to review the assessment data on a monthly basis to help make key instructional decisions depending on the  students achievement.  The team that will review the data is the cabinet along with the ENL teachers and Dual Language  teachers.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We evaluate the success of our ENL program by studying assessment data. We look at informal assessments and formal  assessments such as the NYSESLAT, New York State ELA exams, New York State Math Exams, NY State Science tests, Acuity,  Performance Tasks, and Reading levels. In addition, we check to see if we met AYP for the ELLs and our AMAOs.   Within the Dual Language program and the Free Standing program, student success is evaluated through various measures.  Students are assessed on their success through teacher observations, class assessments, portfolios, interactives, quarterly  projects and student performance (participation and ability to complete tasks independently). In math, students are also  assessing through an MRI; a basic skills test given every 12 weeks. For literacy, students are assessed using the DRP.         4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    We have morning tutoring, Friday Academy and Saturday Academy to help provide intervention to these students.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   In order to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention framework, the classroom teachers monitor the  students at the Tier I level. They provide meaningful lessons, set challenging academic goals and build abilities through  dialogue, questioning and sharing ideas. At this level, the teacher uses unit tests, performance tasks, classroom assignments  and class particpation to determine who needs further assistance. The teachers use the data from the assessments to see  which students have not mastered certain skills or concepts and need to be re- taught. On the Tier II and III levels, the ESL  teacher and SETTs teacherprovide more targeted instruction and additional academic support to help students. Data such as  classwork and participation in these smaller groups is evaluated to see if the child is progressing successfully with this extra  assistance. Classroom teachers work with out of classroom personnel to improve the Tier II and III services.The out of  classroom teacher uses different strategies to try to help students master skills and concepts. If the child still does not make  any progress, the teacher meets with the School Based Support team. The ENL Department along with the Special Education  Department collaborate and make sure that all possible interventions are provided for any student  before he or she  is  referred for Special Education evaluation. We want to prevent any student from being referred to Special Education  unnecessarily.       6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The data from the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT exams reveal data patterns across proficiency levels that are surprising.  The  strongest result is in the speaking modality.  The majority of our students have been in the system for some time and have no  problem expressing themselves in English.  The second strongest result, unlike previous years, is in the writing modality.  The  ELA teachers have introduced the Writing Revolution to our students with the hopes that they can enhance their basic writing       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           59         skills and flourish in their future writing pieces.  Surprisingly, many students showed a weakness in the listening modality.  These students are addressed on an individual basis with small group practice to improve this skill.  During the year their  progress on the ongoing assessments are noted.  The greatest weaknesses of the students are in reading and listening.  This  finding is reinforced by other assessments as previously noted.  According to the data, the ELL population has shown growth  within the Dual Language program. Though it is not reflective on State Exams, through classroom observations and the DRP,  improvement has been shown on their progress.             7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   We meet on a continuous basis and the teachers review theri data during common plannign which takes place at least three  times a week.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   1.a The Freestanding English as a Second Language model is used in our school.  Students are placed into the  freestanding program based on student choice and/or what is currently available at our school. All instruction is done  in English.  Students receive the mandated units of instruction based on the proficiency levels of the student as  determined by the NYSESLAT/NYSITELL  exam.  Students who are at the Entering level receive 360 minutes of ELA and  ENL instruction. Students who are at the Emerging level 90 minutes in a stand alone setting and 180 minutes in ELA or  ENL. Transitioning level students receive 90 minutes in their ELA class and an additional 90 minutes in any of the other  major content areas. Expanding level students receive 180 minutes of ENL services in any of their content area  classes. Finally, those students who are proficent in the English language or on the Commanding level (based on the  passing of the NYSESLAT) still receive 90 minutes of extra ENL help in any of their major subject areas. Students are  placed in classes using the heterogeneous model.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     TBE program is not available in our school at this time.    c.  DL program.  If applicable.      1.     Within the DL program, various instructional strategies are used in order to support ELL’s. The program currently  mimics the roller coaster model as well as the Gomez and Gomez model. The class travels together, and receives their  ESL services within the program. Various techniques are used to reach ELls, such as small groups, in which ELL’s are  heterogeneously mixed with non-ELLs when needed and homogeneously when needed. (Dependent on student  needs and outcomes). Tasks are differentiated according to student need. Teachers use discretion in translation when  needed. Assignments are given in the native language when following the NL blocks. Technology is also used  (smartboard interactives, iPads, videos etc) in order to provide various types of support.        2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?                 All students receive the required amount of minutes of ENL instruction. Students who are at the Entering level receive  360 minutes of ELA and ENL instruction. Students who are at the Emerging level 90 minutes in a stand alone setting and 180       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           60      minutes in ELA or ENL. Transitioning level students receive 90 minutes in their ELA class and an additional 90 minutes in any of  the other major content areas. Expanding level students receive 180 minutes of ENL services in any of their content area  classes. Finally, those students who are proficent in the English language or on the Commanding level (based on the passing of  the NYSESLAT) still receive 90 minutes of extra ENL help in any of their major subject areas. Students are placed in classes  using the heterogeneous model. In addition Mrs. Biscutti is teaching a Spanish elective class. Annually, our ELL teachers design  a matrix that is given to all of our staff members; that includes information about our ELLS and highlights their data. The matrix  is updated monthly and includes the results of the NYSSELAT/NYSITELL, Spanish LAB-R (if necessary), ELA and Math  performance tests. Also, it includes the students proficiency levels and years of service.        3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.         Core content is delivered in the Free standing program using English and uses a variety of instructional approaches and  methods to cater to each child respectively. Classroom teachers are aware of the levels of the students in their classes and  work with the ENL teachers to address the students' needs.  Teachers are expanding their understanding of the needs of their  students and how to best help them by participating in ongoing professional development.  The teachers use a variety of  methods which create visual and concrete examples for their students as they teach standardized curriculum.  Teachers who  have worked with ENL students work closely with the ENL teachers at all times.  Vocabulary and concepts are broken down to  simpler terms as necessary.  All teachers in other areas such as science, social studies, health, art, drama, etc. are aware of all  the ENL students in their classes and the ENL teachers work with these teachers as well.  Student buddies work with  transitioning and expanding level students in small groups to provide extra assistance and develop vocabulary and social skills.  Classroom teachers and ENL teachers review curriculum expectations in advance so that the ENL teacher can preview the  lesson in advance for areas that need further clarification, development or eliciting of background knowledge.  Teachers also  meet to co-plan lessons, creating a variety of activities during the group and/or independent work time to differentiate  instruction to accommodate the ENL students' needs. In the ENL program model, content is delivered in English with native  language support. ENL teachers, provide students with native language glossaries,dictionaries,Ipads to research or translate  and if available with native language textbooks and readings. We currently have resources in Spanish, Arabic and Urdu. The  ENL teachers use the same model adapted with QTEL techniques.  Content and ENL teachers are encouraged to plan  cooperatively to the extent possible during common planning periods. ENL teachers are trained in common core learning  standards. All lessons that are taught are aligned with the CCLS.  All teachers use Inquiry Team methods to study ATS data to  drive their instruction.      Core contents, such as ELA and Math are taught in English, with translations used at discretion when deemed necessary  through teacher observations. A native language arts (NLA) block is used to mirror strategies and skills taught in ELA and  develop the target language. Social studies and science are taught in the native language 3 days of the week and in English 2  days of the week (roller coaster model) with supports and translations when needed. This method reaches students at all  levels in both English and the target language. Interactive notebooks are used in order to support students with visual supports  and organization. Various bridging techniques, such as word endings and cognates are taught and encouraged to help promote  student proficiency in both languages.            4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?         The initial evaluation in students’ NL is based on informal interview in students' mother tongue about their achievements in  the former schools, their studying, reading techniques, attitude towards education, as well as hobbies and interests.  Students  whose native language is Spanish are evaluated with the Spanish Lab. Our school has also implemented the use of screeners to  further assess our students and the progress that they are making.             Due to the recentness of the program (we are currently in our second year), year to year progression has been difficult to  track. Currently evaluations have been based on formal and informal teacher assessments (given in home language). Teacher  conferences have also aided in the success evaluation. Portfolios are used to show student progression within the school year.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           61      Portfolio assignments and assessments include, but are not limited to, unit assessments, lesson exits, projects and class work.  Students also took the DRP last year, in which will be used in comparison to this years.        5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    6.  a. This current school year we have 1 SIFE student. This particular student is monitored closely by the ENL teachers and  regular classroom teachers.  The student receives extra attention and help especially in the areas of reading and writing.  They  are also granted access to computer programs that they can use at school as well as at home. Our SIFE student has  differentiated instruction that uses computer programs, supplemented Common Core Aligned vocabulary and workbooks and  visuals when necessary.  b.  Within the first year,  the entering students from 6th and 7th grades are pulled out together. Beginning students, especially  those brand new to the English language receive 360 minutes of ESL instruction: they are pulled out of their class 180 minutes  per week and given intensive English and content area support instruction in small groups. They are also included in small  flexible groups in our push in model  for academic intervention the remaining 180 minutes per week. We are integrating ENLs  into heterogeneous classes with constant regrouping with English proficient students to maximize instruction and learning  styles. These students in this group receive intensive instruction and intensive use of computers, including Rosetta Stone  software, Max Scholar Phonics and Access Code.  They also receive all the help they need with their classwork, projects,  etc.  Additionally, because NCLB requires ELA testing for ELLs after only one year, these students are receiving even a more  rapid  introduction and more attention given to reading and writing they will need to succeed on the ELA exam.  They also  receive extra help and attention in morning tutoring sessions and Saturday tutoring which provides additional homework help  and extra reading and writing practice.  In the second and third year all these activities are continued and intensified to bring  these students to the highest level possible so they can do well in classwork and standardized  tests.                                                                                                                                               c.  For ELLs receiving service 4 to 6 years, most of these students are usually advanced and require only 180 minutes of  assistance per week.  However, as previously stated, those students who have received a level one on their state tests usually  are receiving 360 minutes of assistance.  In addition, even though most advanced students are serviced by a push in model,  those students who have been under-performing are given individual attention in a small group setting where applicable.  These students are also encouraged to attend morning tutoring and the Saturday Academy to assist in their progression.  The  ELL teachers constantly monitor the progress of these students, in particular, including their progress in their classwork,  homework, projects, preparation for standardized testing, results of ongoing assessment tests and other data.  When  necessary, the parents or guardians are contacted to ensure that the student's work is being followed up at home as well and  that any outside problems are being addressed.                                                                          d.  For ELLs who have completed six years the same procedures are in effect as outlined in answer c above.  These students, in  particular, receive even closer motivating and monitoring.  Students are strongly encouraged to attend all possible extra  programs, including morning tutoring, Saturday Academy, and teachers are encouraged to give these students additional  homework and extra reading and writing practice.  These students also are part of the special intensive reading done in the  Max Scholar program during their Strategic Reading classes. Long Term ELLs have IEP's most of the time and it is important  that the ENL teachers work with the students Special Education teacher to come up with the goals necessary for the student to  meet in order to pass the NYSESLAT exam.   e. All former ELLs (two years or less) receive extended time for all NYS exams.  In addition, bilingual dictionaries are provided  to the same specifications as current ELLs.  To the extent possible, former ELLs are placed in classes of ESL licensed  teachers.  Teachers of former ELLs are trained in the appropriate ways to scaffold instruction when needed.   After careful  examining data, students are placed in classes that appropriately support their language needs.  Students that need literacy  support are placed in ICT classes.  When possible, students are placed in a class that is currently servicing ELLs. Former ELLs are  also offered tutoring and have access to computer programs to ensure growth.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           62      In order to ensure parent understanding of program options, the schools holds various walkthrough throughout the year for  incoming students. This provides an opportunity for parents to (a) become familiar with the programs given and (b)  understand how each program is run.       6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   ELLs with special needs are provided with plenty of visuals and dramatized reading material. Total Physical Response  methodologies buiding academic vocabulary, simplifying content and concept knowledge are ways to provide access to  academic content and accelerate English language development. The technology that is used to help these students includes  Smart Boards, CD players and computers. The ESL teacher meets with the School Based Support Team and the Assistant  Principal and/or the Principal to make sure ELL-SWDs get the correct ELL services. In some cases, a Bilingual Assistant helps the  student in class throughout the day. The ELL- SWDs use the same materials and do the same work as the mainstream students.  However, the tasks and assignments are differentiated based on the student's abilities and on the IEP. Some students may  need simpified instruction using only one or two words while others may need simpler language or have the task broken down  into smaller components. Furthermore, multiple intelligence problem solving strategies are also used by teachers to promote  academic success. These strategies include linguistic, logical-mathematical, bodily-kinesthetic, muscial, interpersonal and  naturalistic.   Dual Language: In order to address ELL-SWDs teacher use various materials and technologies. Sites such Nearpod, 1x1 math,  and brainpop are used to address student’s needs (may be given whole class or individually on iPad, depending on student  needs). Grouping is used both heterogeneously and homogeneously to support students, and to provide differentiation.  Assessments are also given in both English and the target language.        7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Our school uses curricular, instructional and schedule flexibility to enable diverse ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and  attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment through Saturday School,morning tutoring, after school  programs, small group instruction, trips, special events like Field Day, lunch time and recess. The ELL-SWD are in the same  classes with the mainstream students in Saturday School, morning tutoring, after school programs and in small group  instruction. I.S. 51 ensures that flexible programming is used to maximize time spent with non-disabled peers through  meetings between the general education teachers, special education teachers, the out of classroom teachers, SETTs teacher  and School Based Support Team as well as the administration. At lunch time, ELLs -SWDs eat at the same tables and at the  same time as the non-disabled students. They also interact at recess. By encouraging mainstream children to interact with ELL- SWDs, we are able to help these children achieve their IEP goals.   ESL strategies are infused into content instruction using  comprehensive strategies including directed reading-thinking approach (preview, predict, read, review, summarize);  brainstorming, organizing, drafting, reviewing, getting feedback, revising, editing, proofreading, and publishing); teacher read- alouds; focused strategies including graphic organizers, think alouds, think-pair-share and modeling.  Language structures  including mini lessons of grammar in connection with the content lesson, academic vocabulary including content-related  vocabulary in each lesson, semantic webs, personal word banks and scaffolding on an ongoing basis.  Instruction is  differentiated, scaffolded for ELL subgroups using the following methods to help teachers support the learning of ELL students  in the mathematics, social studies and science classes: usage of visuals and manipulatives to illustrate and import ideas, usage  of visual cueing, color coding and graphic organizers used as a way of focusing attention, sequencing steps, increasing ability to  recall information, minimize the number of problems assigned and the amount of copying required,usage of tactile  cues,   capitalize on problems to promote understanding,  sample problems and charts available,  use of sequencing instruction  in small steps with adequate provision for practice and review.Academic language development is planned in a variety of  ways.  The Common Core approach is employed in all language arts classes as well as other content area classes.  Word work,  which includes vocabulary, grammar, spelling, and usage is incorporated into double blocks to address the needs  demonstrated by students through ongoing assessment of both oral and written work.         2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           63      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  ESL strategies are infused into Common Core content instruction using comprehensive strategies including directed reading- thinking approach (preview, predict, read, review, summarize); writing (brainstorming, organizing, drafting, reviewing, getting  feedback, revising, editing, proofreading, and publishing); teacher read-alouds; focused strategies including graphic organizers,  think alouds, think-pair-share and modeling.

The Common Core model is employed in all language arts classes as  well as other content area classes.  Word work, which includes vocabulary, grammar, spelling, and usage is incorporated into  double blocks to address the needs demonstrated by students through ongoing assessment of both oral and written  work.  The ELL teachers push into classes with ELL students, working with the regular classroom teacher to address the  particular needs of this population. Teachers collaborate during common planning and inquiry team’s time in order to address  the increasing need for best ENL methodology. They work with the target population to enhance their understanding of  reading passages and to assist the development of written language conventions.  Special attention is given to basic language  skills for these students. such as phonemic awareness, conventions for word endings such as plurals, tenses and comparisons,  idioms, sentence structure parts of speech and dictionary skills.  Students are given time during the regular class block to work  on supplementary materials that focus on these skills.  ENL teachers also utilize laptop computers in the classroom. Computer  programs such as Max Scholar Phonics, Access Code and Rosetta stone help students learn both visually and auditory. In  addition, all Entering and Emerging students are given dictionaries to work with at home as well as in school.        9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      For the next school year, we plan on continuing the weekend, morning and after school enrichment that will allow the student  to interact with others socially and academically. The data to support these programs includes binders that show progress and  scores on the assessments. The school is also using the reading improvement program ESL Brain-POP, Max Scholar Phonics and  reading and Access Code.  The ELL teachers are working on increased, intensive vocabulary study with all ELLs.  Word  Generation is used by I.S. 51 in Language Arts as well as all content areas to promote extended knowledge in  vocabulary.                                                                                                                                                                                           10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   No programs or services will be discontinued for ELLs since the children have shown improvements in all academic areas.       11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  13. All students are welcome to join in any activities that the school provides. The classroom teachers, ENL teachers,  Administration and Parent Coordinator send translated letters home telling parents about the programs and calling parents to  encourage them to send their children to these programs. Signs are posted outside the school as well. There are specific  programs tailored to the needs of the ELL population. The school offers morning tutoring, Saturday Academy and after school  enrichment. The goals of these programs are to help the student in literacy, math and content area subjects through the use of  supplemental activities and materials designed to improve the student's knowledge base and improve strategies to decode  words, solve mathematical problems as well as improve comprehension in reading and academic language.                12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           64      Currently, we are using a variety of Common Core Aligned text books in all content areas. In terms of technology, the students  use computers, Smart Boards, and have access to IPads that are used for research and translations when needed. They  research subjects on the internet. They play internet games that reinforce math and literacy skills.  leveled libraries in  classrooms (including material in native languages), excellent library which is easily accessible to all well stocked with leveled  materials (including large numbers of native language material and Englisjh/Spanish side-by-side books), excellent librarian  providing additional support for ELL students, translated versions of many textbooks, dictionaries and glossaries to help during  the year and with standardized testing, and additional support by the ENL teachers when eighth grade students are filling out  high school applications.  In addition, our school has started strategic reading and Max Scholar programs this year.  In order to address ELL-SWDs teacher use various materials and technologies. Sites such Nearpod, 1x1 math, and brainpop are  used to address student’s needs (may be given whole class or individually on iPad, depending on student needs). Grouping is  used both heterogeneously and homogeneously to support students, and to provide differentiation. Assessments are also  given in both English and the target language.       13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   In the ENL model, to provide native language support, students are encouraged to read additional material in their native  language.  As previously mentioned classrooms have materials in the native language (books, magazines, dictionaries).  The  library has materials in the native language.  Textbooks are available in the native language.  Dictionaries and glossaries are  provided to encourage use of both languages as well.               Dual Language:  Core contents, such as ELA and Math are taught in English, with translations used at discretion when  deemed necessary through teacher observations. A native language arts (NLA) block is used to mirror strategies and skills  taught in ELA and develop the target language (Gomez and Gomez model). Social studies and science are taught in the native  language 3 days of the week and in English 2 days of the week (roller coaster model) with supports and translations when  needed.           14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.   The support services are based on student needs, assessments and teacher input. Teachers, Administrators and other  personnel take into consideration the students age and grade level in deciding whether an ENL student needs additional  support services and which ones they need developmentally. The Read 180 program allows students to read on their level and  allows them gradually develop their oral, reading and speaking skills. Services and supports correspond to ELL's age and grade  level by allowing the student to read the same story or article as their classmates however, it is given to the student on their  own reading level using programs such as NewsELA.                                                                                                                                 15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Currently, we are using a variety of Common Core Aligned text books in all content areas. In terms of technology, the students  use computers, Smart Boards, and have access to IPads that are used for research and translations when needed. They  research subjects on the internet. They play internet games that reinforce math and literacy skills.  leveled libraries in  classrooms (including material in native languages), excellent library which is easily accessible to all well stocked with leveled  materials (including large numbers of native language material and Englisjh/Spanish side-by-side books), excellent librarian  providing additional support for ELL students, translated versions of many textbooks, dictionaries and glossaries to help during  the year and with standardized testing, and additional support by the ENL teachers when eighth grade students are filling out  high school applications.

Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).    Parents and students are given a tour of the building. They also have the opportunity to meet with the ENL teachers, support  staff, Administrators and parent coordinator to express any concerns or needs before the child comes into the building. In  recent years all newly enrolled ELL students have begun at the beginning of the school year or during the school year and all  incoming procedures have already been outlined earlier in the report. Students who are transitioning from elementary school  to intermediate school participate in an orientation program in the spring before they enter the school.  Parents are invited to  come and translators are used to help.  Students get a tour of the building and get to meet an ENL teacher who will be working  with them. ELLs who arrive during the school year are shown around the building and introduced to their new ELL teacher who  introduces them to Administrators, content classroom teachers as well as fellow classmates. ELLs are often paired up with a  student who speaks their native language to ensure that the new ENL student feels comfortable in his or her new  surroundings.                                                                                                                  17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    At this time we have Spanish language elective offered to ELLS. We also have Spanish Club in after school Sports and Arts  program. However, as previously stated several times, all ELLs are encouraged to continue their use of their native language as  much as possible.          18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   (a) The DL program currently utilizes the roller coaster model and the Gomez and Gomez model.   (b) Core contents, such as ELA and Math are taught in English and a native language arts (NLA) block is  used to mirror strategies and skills taught in ELA and develop the target language. Social studies and  science are taught in the native language 3 days of the week and in English 2 days of the week (roller  coaster model). According to period breakdown, students are receiving a 50/50 breakdown in both  languages.   ( c) Lessons in social studies and science are continuations and are not repeated. Students are expected  to understand and develop content and academic vocabulary in both languages.   (d) Native language arts (NLA) block is used to mirror strategies and skills taught in ELA and develop the  target language.      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Every Monday teachers in our school take part in professional development. Teachers will collaborate with Ms. Fazio and Mrs.  Orzylowska along with our Dual Language teachers in order to address the increasing need for best ESL methodology across  the content areas. Assistant Principals also engage in development to ensure that all ELLs are being properly addressed. Our  goals at these professional developments is to compile a collection of ESL strategies that can be used in content area classes by       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           66      monolingual teachers in order to scaffold instruction for ELL students within their classes. In addition, our ESL certified  teachers will be solicited to provide staff development to ELL teachers or to mainstream teachers with ELLs.  ELL teachers  regularly attend professional development workshops throughout the year.  There are many good opportunities for  Professional Development throughout the city.  They are constantly reviewing new materials for ELL students and the latest  research available.  Our parent coordinator, secretaries and speech therapists are also educated on any new ENL policy and  learning updates. It is our goal that everyone in the building attend a Professional Development based on the needs and goals  for the ENL students in the building. Finally, ELL teachers attend additional professional development workshops during and  after school whenever possible. We are also creating time where the ELL and mainstream teachers collaborate with one  another to look at strategies that can best benefit our students as they engage in Common Core learning standards.     These PDs support teachers in delivering Common Core-aligned instruction by using Pearson CMP3 math program. Teachers  guides include supports for ELLs in every unit.  Scholastic Code X is used in ELA classes for every unit. Every unit includes built  in support for ELLs. Both subject curriculum's are discussed and differentiated during inquiry meetings on Mondays.  The  inquiry teams along with the ESL teachers  modify lesson plans using scaffolding, modeling, chunking, hands on manipulatives,  visual aids; in order to assist ELLs through the  lessons.                                                                                                                                                              2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  The support that we provide to staff(teachers and guidance counselors) to assist with the transition from middle school to high  school includes data on students and Portfolio assessments as well as binder assessments. The teachers and parent  coordinator are also supported by the school leadership when dealing with parents who have difficulties with the process of  applying to high schools and finding the right high school for their child. The guidance counselor is given professional  development on the NYSESLAT and reading the NYSESLAT scores from the ATS as well as information on for the ELL students.  The ESL teacher also meets with guidance counselors to explain potential difficulties ELL parents and children may have in  going to high school. Guidance counselors with the assistance of the ELL teachers help the ELLs with their high school  applications and any information they need to aid in their transition to high school.  If necessary, a Spanish translated high  school directory is available.  If the parent has any questions about the process, they are invited to come in for a  meeting.  After the students have received their high school assignment, they meet with the guidance counselor and the  programmer/guidance counselor from the high school they will be attending to select courses and insure that the student will  continue to receive ELL services as needed.  In the event they score proficient on the May NYSESLAT exam, the student is  assured not to have ELL services in high school, although they will still be entitled to transitional support as needed.  I.S. 51 is a  very diverse community. We promote cultural and religious awareness. Students are treated with respect and they are held to  high expectations with cultural and religious understanding and respect for each other.  We hold anti-bullying seminars to help  promote the high standards. If a guidance counselor is not available, ELLs can come to their ELL teacher for support and help  with their problems.  In the beginning of the school year 6th grade orientation and back to school night are provided to secure  small transitioning from elementary school to middle school. Classroom visits are done by guidance counselors; especially in  the beginning of the year and also when a new student is admitted into the school. ELLs specifically are observed to ensure  that the student is comfortable and aware of the school environment. At risk counseling and mandated counseling is also  provided by the two full time employed guidance counselors.  8th grade students particularly ELLs are assisted with high school  applications. Assemblies on bullying and cyberbullying are also conducted regularly throughout the year for all  students.                     The 7.5 hours of ELL training for all staff and 10 hours for special education staff of training involves providing teachers and  paraprofessionals with professional development on the process of becoming an English Language Learner, NYSITELL and  NYSESLAT testing, Second Language Acquisition Theory, Strategies and Methodologies in ESL, Programs for ELLs, helping  students meet the CCLS, and data for the ELLs. This is done on Staff Development days and grade meeting and conferences.                     2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           67            Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Parental involvement is an intricate part of our community. The school has an active PTA organization which reaches out to all  parents including the parents of the ELLs.  Parents are encouraged to attend PTA meetings, become involved in all school  activities, and  be involved in the education of their children.  Teachers are in constant contact with parents, with or without  translation, to make sure parents are aware of the issues facing their children and to assist them if their children are having  any problems of any kind.  Parents come to school regularly, including open school conference time, to meet with the teacher  in person to discuss their child's education.  Parent Teacher Conferences are held twice a year and parents are strongly  encouraged to attend as this is when they can receive their child's report card.  All activities are sent out in Spanish (and other  languages, as necessary) and translators are available.  Parents are asked to complete a survey to indicate areas of need.  The  Parent Survey is reviewed by the leadership and inquiry teams to determine areas of need that can be addressed by changes in  the CEP or by scheduling workshops.  The Parent Coordinator does outreach to parents who have students in need of SES  services.  Assistance is given to complete these applications.  Our population consists of students representing  cultural and  language diversity including our top language groups (Spanish, Arabic, and Urdu).  It is recognized that within and among these  language groups there are cultural differences, which will be reflected in the school environment. Parents are aware of the  school's high expectations about non discrimination against any culture or any religion. In consideration for student success, it  is important that a school and home relationship be heightened.  Parents must be made aware of the importance of explicit  socialization of students to the cultural expectations of the classroom, for example, interaction with other students, classroom  behaviors, group work, whole class discussions; etc.  It is in this regard that we continuously strengthen our parent edification  through various workshops using the native language through in-house consultants.   In addition, conversations and  communication about student performance will be ongoing throughout the school year.  In doing so, we increase the parents’  understanding of academic standards, assessments and tests.  Also, translation services are utilized as a means of  communicating information about the school’s various academic programs and students’ participation to LEP parents.  These  activities are in part but are not restricted to the use of in-person interpretation and for translation of appropriate school  documents not available from the central board. Every Tuesday afternoon during the extended day for teacher's, time is set  aside for parent engagement. Our school stresses the importance to ELL parents and invites them to come to the school and  meet with teachers to discuss the students' progress.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   The school closely studies the parent surveys to further evaluate the needs of parents.  The teachers, the ELL teachers,  guidance counselors, assistant principals and the parent coordinator meet with parents whenever necessary.  During the initial  orientation of new admits the ELL teachers spend as much time as necessary explaining everything about the school and  finding out the needs and concerns of the parents. Translation and  Interpretation services are provided to assist in helping the  parents. Specific activities geared towards ENL and ENL parents include trips, mentor and mentee programs. Our ESL licensed  teacher Ms. Fazio is involved in mentoring 8th grade students and parents.  M&M program holds annual celebrations Parents  are always welcome to come in and assist within the school setting. Translation services are available in the school through  teacher and staff members that speak that particular language as well as through the DOE translation unit. Letters to the  parents and school calendars are translated into applicable languages based on the Home Language Surveys that were filled  out at registration. We also have parents who translate during PTA meetings. The Parent Coordinator plays an important role  in the school in that he holds meetings and workshops to help parents meet the educational, physical and psychological needs  of their children. She gives out surveys, and checklists to see what areas parents need workshops to improve their knowledge  and coping skills. She also meets with parents who are having problems with teachers or school staff and tries to work out  these issues. .                2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           68      Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.    We also have a spring and fall orientation tours to inform parents of the incoming 6th graders for the upcoming school year. During  these learning walkthroughs, parents have an opportunity to visit the school, get informed about programs in the school, visit  classrooms, meet teachers, and get an overall idea of how the school functions in a daily basis. Translators are available for these  parent orientations. Parents will leave the school with an idea of what are the school expectations, rules and regulations,  assessments, instructional standards , academic rigor and support on their part to work with the school community to their  children’s best interest. We invite parents to send out letters with questions and concerns in order to address their needs.                             2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           69   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.                     In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Nicholas Mele, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.            2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           70                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Intermediate School 51                                                                              School DBN:    31R051  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Parents of ELL's state their translation needs during the initial interview with ESL certified teachers Ms.  Orzylowska and Ms. Fazio, or our Dual Language teachers, Ms. Contreras, Ms, Nevareaz, Ms, Raffelini and Ms.  Montoya    Parents of all students fill in the Blue Emergency Cards where they indicate their oral and written language  preferences.    If and when a content area needs to send something specific home to a particular student, the teachers ask their  students if the information that is being sent home needs to be translated for their for parents.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           72      A separate survey which contained information about parents’ prefered language of communication ( both  written and oral) was sent home in September.The survey was returned to their teachers. The majority preferred  English language notices.    The parent coordinator ensures that appropriate translations and interpretators are provided at PT Conferences  at the parent and/or teachers request.
