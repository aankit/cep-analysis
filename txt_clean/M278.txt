This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   PS/MS 278 is committed to preparing our students for future success by providing an environment where students  will experience optimal social, emotional, and academic success through a challenging, rigorous, and safe  environment.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Since our school’s inception in 2004, the vision has been one of creating partnerships with our parent body, our  surrounding community and enriching the lives of our students through the Arts. We believe we have created such an  environment for our children. Our parents are always welcomed in our school. Wellness initiatives, cafeteria and  playground support and financial support for our Arts programs, running of our Book Fairs, creating and running our  school’s website are all positive indications that they feel a part of our school community.    With the understanding that all children need avenues to be successful, the Arts play a very important role in the  development of our students. In addition to the weekly art classes our students take, middle school students also  have the opportunity to take Portfolio Art on Mondays, or participate in Creative Art Works sessions with teaching  artists.      Our diverse community of Inwood provides enrichment in the various genres of music. We have instrumental and  choral instruction, in addition to "92 nd St Y” residencies for students in grades K-5. We have an Elementary chorus,  Middle School Chorus, Middle School Musical, and a band for students in grades 4-8. With our partnership with the  Situation Project, our middle school students also attend 2 Broadway shows per year. This experience allows all of our  students to attend 6 Broadway shows free of charge by the time the graduate.      Lastly, we offer a School-wide Enrichment Model program. The major goal of the SEM program is the application of  gifted education pedagogy to total school improvement. The SEM provides enriched learning experiences and higher  learning standards for all children through three goals; developing talents in all children, providing a broad range of  advanced-level enrichment experiences for all students, and providing advanced follow-up opportunities for young  people based on their strengths and interests. The SEM clusters are required to demonstrate to the community in a  creative way their learning and when possible give back to the community either by sharing their knowledge or raising  money through their creative ways to donate to a cause that is meaningful to them. Such charities as St. Jude’s  Hospital, Doctors’ Without Borders, and the Love Kitchen have benefited from their creativity and generosity in the  past.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Further, to strengthen the understandings of our ENLs and Students with Disabilities, we offer a Saturday Academy to  re-teach the necessary concepts that students might not have mastered. In addition, this year we are opening up our  Saturday Academy to 2nd and 3rd graders to focus on fluency and phonemic awareness. ENLS and SWDs that are  reading 2 or more grade levels below will also be targeted in Saturday Academy.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   According to our Quality Snapshot, our school has made the most progress over the past year in Rigorous Instruction,  Supportive Environment, Effective School Leadership, and Trust.      Our key areas of focus this school year will be Collaborative Teachers, Strong Family Ties, and Student Achievement.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 06M278   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   0K,01,02,03,04,05,0 6,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   559   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     According to our school survey report, we are considered Well Developed in Rigorous Instruction. However, until  every student is at proficiency or higher in ELA and Math, we must work to achieve that level of understanding for all  our students.    Recognizing the significance of a strong foundation in reading in K-2, the priority need that we will address is ensuring  that the majority of our students are proficient by the time they reach 3rd grade.   Specific analysis of our data on the New York State assessments, however, showed little growth in moving our  students with disabilities and our ENL students. Therefore, explicit teaching and re-teaching, Saturday programs,  computer based web programs that are diagnostic and place students at their level of achievement are multiple ways  we will move this population of students.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   By June 2019, at least 65% of K-2 students will be proficient in reading as evidenced by Fountas and Pinnell assessments.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

Our  proficiency level on the 2017-18 ELA NY State assessment was 55%, up from 52% the previous year.   This year, we have the opportunity to add a Math coach to our staff. As a result we have planned specific content  teacher teams, professional development, and ongoing teacher coaching cycles as needed and directed by  administration. Our staff has noticed gaps in our present curricula. Therefore a portion of our professional  development will be focused on studying and implementing supplementary programs in order to fill these gaps.    However, greater emphasis needs to be directed at our ENLs, SWDs, and those general education students who find  mathematics difficult. It is important then for teachers to have time to collaboratively plan, discuss best practices, use  EngageNY and Think Central as a resource. Our re-teach plan, Saturday Academy and our AIS support by all our  teachers should support growth for this cohort of students.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          32     State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33           Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?    The following assessments are being used to guide instructional planning:  Wilson   Fundations  Fountas & Pinelli-Ready  Citywide ELA Benchmark Assessments  NYSITELL  NYSESLAT  Spanish Lab   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?        During the fall, this school administers the citywide ELA Benchmark Assessment within the elementary and middle school  classroom as scheduled by the school Test Coordinator.  The i-Ready Diagnostic with interactive online learning and reinforcement is administered weekly by the Computer teacher in  conjunction with classroom teachers. Results are available immediately.  NYSITELL is administered to all eligible ELLs within the first 10 days of enrollment following the schedule created by the ENL  Coordinator & teacher. Spanish Lab is administered by a certified bilingual teacher. The NYSESLAT exam is administered each  spring to all eligible ELL students. A schedule is created to ensure all ELLs are assessed within the grade bands following a  schedule that coincides with that created by the state.  The available data helps drive instruction, pinpoint areas of weakness for enrichment and remediation.  The data also determines who will be eligible for Academic Intervention and other small group instruction.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?     PS/MS 278 evaluates the success of our programs for ELLs from the NYSESLAT results and also from the Action Plan of the  Comprehensive Educational Plan. This Action Plan is used as a tool to support effective implementation and in evaluating  progress towards meeting our goals. Our Action Plan provides key strategies and activities to be implemented for the school  year to support accomplishment of our identified goals. Our Action Plan strategies and activities for our ELLs are tied to our  annual goal which is specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-bound.  In addition, this school implements i-Ready Diagnostic which determines every student's academic skills in English Language  Arts, Reading, and Mathematics.  Finally, student achievement is measured in State standardized test results as well as individual performance on student report  cards.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?     Summative data is gathered and students in need are provided with AIS service. Students are also provided with on-going  small group intervention on a 6 week rotating basis. Additionally all students are provided with individualized instruction  based on each child's unique needs through the i-Ready program.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]      ELL students who are identified in September as performing below grade level receive individualized instruction beginning in  the classroom (Tier 1).  This includes but is not limited to guided reading, shared reading, student accountable talk (partners  discussing or commenting on a task together) and monthly Tier 2 words school wide to build vocabulary.  Tier II students are  chosen based on previous state exams as well as teacher recommendations. Our School Wide Enrichment Program aids in  vocabulary development and provides experiences outside the academic scope.  Teachers also use one-to-one instruction and  small group instruction daily. In Tier II and Tier III, providers use a variety of strategies such as but not limited to a push-in/pull- out model to provide targeted instruction, word games, math games and writing strategies to increase vocabulary, fluency and  comprehension and math skills.  Students in Tiers I, II, and III are assessed on a 10-12 week cycle with  adjustments made as  needed.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].    The results of the assessments used to evaluate and inform ELL programs are:  NYSITELL  NYSESLAT  NYS ELA  Classroom Assessments  I-Ready   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44            7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The findings are disseminated and discussed with faculty during Professional Development, and during Faculty conferences.  Results are also discussed between teachers at common time. Changes in instruction to address areas of weakness are  implemented.  The findings are disseminated to parents and school community during Parent Engagement and through Parent-Teacher  conferences.           Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Throughout all the grades student at a Transitioning or an Expanding level receive 180 minutes/week of ENL services  through integrated ENL where the ENL teacher co-teaches with the content area teacher to help build the English  Language skills of the students through appropriate scaffolding techniques. The ENL teacher focuses on vocabulary  development and language structure within the content area.   Students that tested on an Entering or Emerging level receive an additional 180 minutes/week of services through  Stand Alone ENL. They receive English Language development instruction by a NYS certified TESOL teacher. In  Stand Alone students are most often grouped homogeneously.  Students that tested Commanding on the NYSESLAT, or Expanding on NYSESLAT with a Level 3 on NYSELAT receive 90  minutes/week of integrated ENL services.       b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     This schools does not have a Transitional Bilingual Program   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      This school does not have a Dual Language Program      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?                ENL teachers create an individualized schedule to ensure that the students receive the amount of time they are entitled  to for ENL services. They are provided with the appropriate amount of instructional time based on their proficiency level. The  teacher and administration will look closely at the students’ proficiency levels. Based on this information, they will plan the  appropriate time and program allocation as per the Part 154 guidelines.   * Entering and Emerging levels – 360 minutes/week,  whereby in grades K-6 180 minutes will be delivered as Integrated ENL  and 180 min as Stand Alone ENL in the lower grades. In grade 8 the Emerging levels receive 180min/week of Integrated ENL  and 180 min of Stand Alone ENL.   * Transitioning and Expanding levels - 180 minutes/week will be delivered through integrated ENL .  * Commanding Levels - 90min/week will be delivered as an Integrated ENL Service.   Additional support is offered  in an ENL – After school program.        (2a).  Teachers deliver explicit ENL by planning for both content and language objectives. Teachers also use scaffolding   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      techniques, bring in realia, and reach out to different learning styles and modalities. Each ENL lesson entails reading, writing,  listening and speaking components. Teachers plan their lessons based on the Common Core Standards, focusing on language  and content objectives, as well as teaching through our School Enrichment Model.  In the Freestanding ENL program, the teacher differentiates and scaffolds every lesson to further support ELLs within their  classroom. Teachers focus on specific language skills in reading, writing, speaking, and listening through direct instruction in  small groups. Lessons are plan addressing the state ELA standards of instruction.        Our School Enrichment Model is a program in which students participate in a topic of their choice and learn through real-life  experiences, researching, listening to various speakers, learning on the Internet, field trips, etc.      All teachers use explicit ENL methodologies in their instruction, meeting the ENL standards while addressing the new  Common Core Standards. This school has implemented the new Common Core aligned programs, ReadyGen, Code-X, GoMath,  which multi-cultural texts, fiction, non-fiction, newspapers and poetry to enhance the students’ understanding of the  language. Additionally, teachers enhance instruction with technologies in their classrooms and in the library, as well as native  language dictionaries and L1 academic content specific glossaries in order to aid and assist in language transference ( L1-L2).      The ENL teachers try to work directly with classroom teachers and help plan their instruction to meet ENL and Common Core  standards.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      Content area instruction is delivered in partnership and collaborative planning with the elementary classroom teacher as well  as content area instructors (6-8 in middle school). Focus in front loading vocabulary, scaffolding and differentiating instruction  is a main priority. All instruction is delivered in English. The ENL teacher works with the content area teacher to provide  instruction and assistance for Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding and Commanding level students. Entering and  Emerging level students are also pulled out for small group instruction in a Stand Alone ENL class.             Content area in grades (K-3) is aligned with Common Core Learning Standards. Thematic instruction is used to enrich and  expand on content Social Studies, Science, ELA, and Mathematics with focus on incorporation of language objectives.   For the Stand Alone ENL groups, focus is on remediation of basic skills in content areas while differentiating instructions for  students.   In order to make the content comprehensible and to enrich the students’ language development the teachers implement  scaffolding strategies, pictures, realia and ENL methodologies throughout all the grades. All instruction is presented in English  with a new focus on inclusion of Tier II words, close reading, etc. and skills that are overall related to the Common Core  Standards.       We continue to use the Common Core Curriculum which includes Scholastic Code-X and  Ready Gen for ELA instructions and  GoMath and Engage New York for mathematics.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?       Students are provided with home language support throughout the year. Supports include home language support in the  Imagine Learning program. Additionally, students are provided opportunities to access information in their home language  through the use of bilingual dictionaries, bilingual content area  glossaries, Internet resources, software program resources,  etc. Teachers, paraprofessionals, other staff and even students who are bilingual have also provided support at times.  However, as we are neither speaking Mandarin, Japanese, Arabic, Albanian or Serbo- Croatian, we are not able to evaluate  these students in their home language.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      6a).  Currently this school does not have any designated SIFE students. The plan for SIFE students begins by assessing their  needs, taking into consideration their biographical background and prior educational history. We examine their academic  history and family history, to gain a holistic perspective on  the student.  After a comprehensive diagnostic, we would begin to  provide Academic Intervention Services (AIS) and English as a New Language (ENL). We will meet as a school intervention team  to determine an individualized plan to meet this students’ needs. The student will be placed in an age-appropriate class, so  that their age-appropriate developmental and social needs could be addressed.  The parents, along with the support of the AIS  team and ENL teachers  provide support for the student. The AIS and ENL services is comprised of only small groups to support  the student better. Additionally they would get one-on-one instruction for AIS as well as ENL to be able to cater to their  individual needs.  We would continue to track the students' progress and monitor it on an on-going basis to ensure that the  services are meeting their needs. Teachers use sight words, picture dictionaries, low readability high-interest books, and age  appropriate materials that support the curriculum. The AIS team will use Fundations to support their decoding and phonics  abilities. The ENL teachers would continue to work with picture dictionaries to help building vocabulary and design lessons  that help the students master everyday situations as well as situations in school.  We would also elicit support from Learning  Leaders to provide native language support when possible.   6b).   If the child is a newcomer to a US school, the child is serviced in smaller pull-out groups (or in a one-to-one setting if  necessary) with more individualized attention to meet his or her academic needs. For newly arrived students, teachers also  invest a significant amount of time introducing the student to the new culture, school, customs and basic conversational skills.  We have specific materials that will support the students’ academic needs, utilizing realia, songs, visuals, and picture  dictionaries and photo libraries to enhance their vocabulary development and according to the appropriate developmental  need.  The school will implement test prep sessions after school and pays additional attention to test prep strategies during  the school day to help the newcomers to be successful on the New York State exams, which is mandatory after only one year  in the New York State public school system.  The school also offers an ENL after-school program (Title III)  for students to  improve their English Language skills in Speaking, Listening, Reading and Writing. Teachers offer test sophistication, help in  content areas, reading and writing through test prep, Reader’s theater, technologies, games, etc.    6c).   Our plan for ELLs receiving services for 4 to 6 years is to continue to enhance their listening, speaking, reading and  especially writing skills. Our action plan is to increase the number of ELLs who show progress in writing as measured by the  annual CEP goal and Action Plan.   (6d).   Many of our long-term ELLs also qualify for AIS. The ENL and AIS teacher will examine their test history and  communicate with the classroom teachers to identify specific needs of the child, which is often mastering reading and writing  the academic language.  A large proportion of our long-term ELLs are deficient in the reading and writing modality on the  NYSESLAT and ELA. The teachers will be working with the content area teachers in the upper grades to support content area  instruction and listening, speaking, reading and writing. Furthermore the teacher reinforces language skills the students need  in the classroom while also focusing on their individual needs like vocabulary work and grammar.  While teachers support the  specific content, they also integrate the reading strategies, comprehension practice and conventions of writing to help the  students understand the text problems in Mathematics or Science. In content area instruction the teacher supports and  encourages the students to read, use, and utilize charts, maps, and graphs when reading a scientific text. Content specific  vocabulary work and practice focuses on their language skills. They integrate the correct use of writing conventions based on  the students’ individual needs and levels in order to support them to complete their portfolios. Students supported with AIS  practice reading, listening, speaking and writing in small groups. In every subject the teachers encourage the student to  expand their vocabulary by using pictures and realia as well as Tier II words and teach them strategies to learn to understand a  new word from the context or using dictionaries and thesauri efficiently.  6e) Former ELLs (in years 1 and 2 after testing Commanding) still receive mandated test modifications which consists of  additional time during state tests and classroom tests. Additionally proficient ELLs receive support during 90 min of Integrated  ENL services a week.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?      The Resource Room teacher, the ENL and the ICT Teacher as well as the school based support team work together to review  the child’s IEP to identify the child’s needs. We will include any modifications that the students need for instruction or  assessment. The instruction will be aligned to the student’s IEP. Leveled learning and appropriate materials are decided upon  after reviewing the ELL-SWD's individual education plan (IEP) in conjunction with learning modalities.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47         7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?     This school meets the diverse needs of ELL-SWDs in curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility with least  environmental restrictions by adhering to the students IEP. Student progress is monitored and discussed on an individual basis  during Pupil Personnel Team meetings.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.     Academic Intervention Providers service all at-risk children including ELLs who score a level 1 or 2 on the NY State exams.  Classroom teachers will use Tier l Intervention through differentiated instruction. Students who are referred for Tier II  Intervention will have small group instruction or one-to-one in a push-in or pull-out model during the school day. The AIS  providers consistently review data and student work to ascertain growth. In order to provide the best intervention for their  students, their “tool kit” consists of professional development in:  •     Understanding and using data to inform instruction  •     Implementing a variety of strategies from diverse sources  •     Using Bloom’s Taxonomy to develop students’ higher order critical thinking skills and learning to use higher order  questioning techniques in order to met the  rigorous challenges of the Common Core Learning Standards.  •     Using rubrics measure student growth   •     Being able to differentiate instruction so that learning is assessable to all students     Some of the following programs and systemic approaches are used in reading (Fundations, Wilson,  Words Their Way,  Kaplan, Ready New York CCLS, Shared Reading and Guided Reading). The following programs and systematic approaches are  used in math (games and other intervention strategies).      As students are assessed weekly, monthly, and at the end of the 6 week cycle, they can either be taken out of AIS services or  remanded for a second intensive cycle.  This decision is based on an analysis of the data of individual student progress and  classroom teacher input in consultation with administration.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      A continuation of services will be provided for ELLs for the upcoming school year in accordance with CR Part 152.2  Continuation of compliance mandates will be adhered to, as well as continuation of Title III After School Program services. At  this time we will not be adding any new programs during the school week, but will study how to improve existing ones.  This school has created a Saturday Academy to provide academic enhancement to students (including ELLs) in ELA and  Mathematics.         10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?      This school does not have a bilingual program at this time. According to Parent Surveys and Program Selection and Choice,  nearly 100% of parents have selected the ENL model for their child's language program.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.     All children in this school, including ELLs, have equal access to all school programs that are offered and the school  populations (as a whole) are grouped heterogeneously. ELLs are afforded access to supplementary educational programs such  as Academic Intervention Services (AIS) if it is determined that such services would benefit the student. ELLs have access to  participate in the Title III After School program to enhance skills and focus on academic enhancement in a small group  environment. ELLs are also invited to participate in the Inwood Community Services, an academically intensive NYC funded  after school program which meets daily in this school. ELLs are also invited to participate in CHAMPS, a city funded physical  education program. ELLs are invited to participate in the after school music program. All programs are offered in this building.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.     For the lower grades (K-1), the ENL teacher utilizes Santillana “Spotlight on English” during Stand Alone ENL to introduce  and/or reinforce concepts and increase vocabulary. Phonics, basic skills and content is taught through “Spotlight on English”.  Picture vocabulary is taught through Spotlight Photo Cards for English-Language Learners, Metro ABC Hand puppets and  inflatable letter realia. For this ENL program, the teacher utilizes Stand Alone ENL and Integrated ENL  models to service the  students in the lower grades in accordance with the new Part 154-2. As a school that incorporates the School-wide Enrichment  Model, ESL teachers utilizes a hands-on approach to thematic instruction for students creating projects while incorporating all  modalities of NYS ELL Standards and the Common core Learning Standards.     In grades 1 and  2 (self-contained),  the teacher uses Ready Gen which is aligned with the Common Core Standards and  implements thematic instruction for Social Studies and Science, thus reinforcing content area themes, as well as, enrichment  with scaffolding techniques and front loading vocabulary.  Each lesson is planned to provide an opportunity for Reading,  Writing, Listening and Speaking in English.      In grades 3-8 classrooms the ENL teacher in conjunction with the classroom teacher implements Ready Gen and code-X for  ELA, MacMillan/McGraw Hill series for Social Studies and Science, Engage NY and GoMath for mathematics as well as Glencoe  New York State Science for Science instructions.      Ready Gen and Code-X a path to Common Core success with digging deeply into complex texts is expanding on big ideas,  creating connections and relationships to ensure enduring understandings.    For these grades the ENL teacher confers with ELL students during instruction and independent practice to provide reading and  comprehension strategies, while building on fluency in order to dissect text comprehension problems.  The teacher uses  scaffolding techniques incorporating ESL methodology in order to make content more comprehensible.  Some of our teachers  create mini lessons in video format that adds additional support for students as they can access them from home.   Most of our classrooms have smart boards that the teachers use for instruction. Additionally teachers can use e-readers as  well as laptops or ipads with their students. Each classroom has several desktops as well that can be used for research and  instruction. Entering and Emerging students are supported with "Imagine Learning" pro     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   We provide native language content area glossaries, dictionaries, etc.  We make  use of technology based translation programs  as well as other technologies that enhance language acquisition (Rosetta Stone, Imagine Learning,...) for ELLs. When necessary  we provide native language support through Translation through volunteer interpreters.   Students receive extra time during assessment.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.      All required services support and resources correspond to ELL’s ages and grade levels. Materials are age and grade level  appropriate and support materials that correspond with the entering, emerging, transitioning, expanding and commanding  proficiency levels of the overall NYSESLAT proficiency rating.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?      This school does not share educational space with another school, however, we do share the cafeteria, gymnasium, and  auditorium., with PS18-The Park Terrace School. The schools have separate lunch periods, physical education periods, and  separate scheduled auditorium periods.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).      In order to assist newly enrolled ELL students before the beginning of the school year, students and parents are invited to  attend a “Welcome and Orientation” session. During this session students and parents are given a tour of the school facilities.  Tours are conducted by the bilingual (Spanish) Parent Coordinator as well as administration. Prospective parents and students  are made aware of program offerings and services that the school provides. Parents are made aware of the parent support   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49         meetings which include monthly conversations on ELL centered topics that can assist parents and students throughout their  school year. (Title III: Parent Support).     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?       Since this, at present, is a monolingual K-8 elementary school, all classes are in English as per parent survey and selection.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  1. We provide this training not only through Professional Development, but by including various members of staff on our  Language Allocation Policy team: the Principal, Assistant Principal, ELL Coordinator, ENL teachers, Parent Coordinator, Parent  Association President, Classroom and Subject teachers, Academic Intervention Service teacher, Data Specialist, Guidance  Counselor,and Math Coach. We work collaboratively to support our ELLs by including a representative staff committee  (Principal's cabinet) that touches on all content areas and needs. Weekly grade level meetings to discuss the needs of ELLs are  ongoing.  In addition, the DELLSS will provide staff development to the ELL coordinator who will subsequently turnkey and educate the  staff about the different components and guidelines for the ELL population.  Some of the trainings will include: data analysis of  pertinent exams (NYSESLAT, NYSITELL); ELL identification; Mandates (Part 154-2). A partial list of activities is:  * Fortifying Academic Conversations in the ENL Classroom Institute: 11/7, 12/5, 12/14, 1/10  *Scaffolding Instruction in Elementary Mathematics for ELLs: 11/20, 12/18  The ENL team and staff overall will further explore  professional development opportunities with the United Federation of Teachers-UFT as well as others.  ENL teachers are  committed to devoting 50% of their professional development time to ELL specific topics.            2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  All teachers are encouraged to meet the required state Professional Development requirements according to their license  needs. Teachers are afforded the opportunity to attend Professional Development workshops by certified CTLE providers on  non-student attendance dates. All professional certificate holders are required to file documentation of their 100 hours of  professional development per 5 years to the NYS Office of Certification and Licences as well as the New York State Dept. of  Education Certification and Licence.   Individual NYC public schools are no longer capable of providing CTLE hours to Professional License holders; teachers must  seek qualified, accredited, DOE and outside CTLE providers to obtain required hours.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50            Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   In the course of the school year, parents of ELLs will be invited to meet with their child's ENL teacher on Tuesdays during  parent engagement time. If it is not possible for a parent /guardian to visit the school during that time, alternative  arrangements will be made (teleconference, etc.). . During these meetings the student's language development, assessment  results, language needs and future goals will be discussed. Such meeting can be conducted with a qualified  interpreter/translation in the language or mode of communication the parent or guardian best understands, as discussed in  this school's Language Translation and Interpretation Plan.  Presently, most non-Spanish speaking parents have requested English for written and verbal communication.  When necessary, interpretation and translation accommodations will be scheduled in advance.  All dated conference documentation is kept on file in the Main Office. Other summarizing is completed on-line in Jupiter  grading, and/or SESIS notation.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   PS/MS 278 recognizes the importance of parental involvement in the development of ELL students. Parents are always  welcome to share their concerns and ask questions. An orientation is scheduled for all parents with children eligible for the  ENL program who enter the school system for the first time, whose language is other than English and who fail to meet the  cut-off score in the NYSITELL. Parents are introduced to the programs that the NYC Department of Education offers via  informative video which highlights and explains each program in depth. The Parent Coordinator will conduct Parent  Workshops based on the solicited topics of interest from parent surveys. Initially, these meetings will also cover issues such as:  parent legal rights, promotional standards and criteria, Department of Education and school policy, the ENL program  philosophies and regulations. The PS/MS 278 School Community has created and publicized various support structures and  programs to ensure all parents are aware of education options available to their children.The school Parent Association has  created a website where meetings and news are discussed. The school leadership, along with the Parent Coordinator and the  Parent Teacher Association provide various meetings and workshops with featured community speakers and conducted in  conjunction with community groups to disseminate information that is useful to parents. Some conferences conducted by  Cornell University include: “Nutrition Workshops” and “Save Energy” workshops. This school was in partnership with "Learning  Leaders" an organization that trains parents on how to become volunteers in their child's school. Trained Learning Leaders  cover strategies for working with children in reading, writing, and mathematics with a focus on cognitive child development  and learning styles. Volunteers completed all 3 trainings and submitted 3 references to become certified Learning Leaders.  This school also works in conjunction with The NYC Fire Department which has also conducted CPR Workshops, and Fire Safety  Workshops. In addition the school community keeps parents abreast of important news, events, students’ progress and parent  rights through parent/teacher conferences in November and March, “Back to School Night” conferences, parents’ letters,  fliers, newsletters and informative workshops. As a school community, we ensure that information is provided in the home  language. Both the school staff and parent volunteers work as liaisons to assist in oral and written translation. Additional  resources are sought through the NYC DOE Office for Family Engagement and Advocacy and the NYC DOE Translation and  Interpretation Unit. The school partners with Washington Heights/Inwood Coalition which periodically conducts workshops on  issues that pertain specifically to newly arrived, or recent immigrant families.  Additionally we seek the expertise of Center for Anti-Violence Education,  which addresses physical defence and abuse issues.               Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Lillian  Reyes, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PS/MS 278                                                                              School DBN: 06M278  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       This school will use the NYC Department of Education Parent Survey (which is translated into 9 high incidence  languages) to gather feedback from parents on the quality and availability of services, along with this school's Parent- Teacher Association Survey. This school and this School's Leadership Team will review and analyze findings to make  necessary adjustments. Parents are also afforded the opportunity to address the quality and availability of services at  monthly Parent-Teacher Association Meetings and monthly School Leadership Team Meetings. This school will  examine how to close the gap in providing written surveys in low incidence languages.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59
