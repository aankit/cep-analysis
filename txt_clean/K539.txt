This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      Our students, educators, families, and community partners are dedicated to establishing an active and nurturing  environment that fosters academic excellence and growth through service. We are committed to empowering,  respecting, and believing in ourselves, each other and our work together as conscious agents of change. Through high   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      quality instruction and the development of civic, social, and technical skills, we will create a community of critical  thinkers, lifelong learners, and productive global citizens.               2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    The High School for Service and Learning (HSSL) is a small school of approximately 300 students, situated on the  Erasmus campus in Flatbush, Brooklyn.      Our student population is primarily African American with a growing Hispanic, Haitian Creole, and multi-racial  population from the Middle East and South Asia. Students come to HSSL with a strong sense of cultural pride and  sense of community. This plethora of perspectives adds to the rich culture of the school.       As noted above, we continue to grow in the areas of academic achievement, professional development of teachers,  and inquiry work, and we are continuing to increase student college readiness, through focused attention and  creating a strategic plan from with the administrative team. We have partnered with Brooklyn College, Peer Health,  Groomed for Success, Service in Schools, and New York Cares to offer supports for our students and enrichment  activities not limited to college visits, college course work, service learning, and mentors for our most at need  students. Our strengths lie in our maintaining an excellent graduation rates, preparing students for success on  Regents exams and in their academic course work, and in creating a culture of respect in the school.       Additionally this year we have instituted diverse initiatives that have helped increase student achievement, culture,  and enrollment. These initiatives are as followed:     Technology based differentiated support for diverse learners such as the use of Read 180 and Systems 44 to   improve literacy skills and Khan Academy and ALEKS for math competency building.      Offering of course work such as AP US History, Chemistry and Physics for advanced leveled students    Being a part of the Computer Science NYCDOE and establishing a Computer Science Club for the 2018-19   school year      Re establishing criteria for the 2018-19 National BETA Club for the 2018-19 school year     Re-launch of Service Learning projects, club, and a service learning course for elective credit for incoming 9th   graders      Re-branding and uniform implementation    Recruitment Pipeline with neighboring middle schools such as New Heights and M.S. 61, I.S. 354, and   Brooklyn Environmental M.S 246       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   The number of students who qualify for free lunch is around 80% for the 2018-19 school year. Our student with  disabilities population has been a steady 19% for the past two yeas as our ELL population has increased dramatically  from the 2016-17 being at 13% to the 2017-18 school year and as of May 2018, we are currently at 20%. Our  attendance rate has been maintained at around 84% for the last three years. Some of the needs for these students   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      are remedial course work support, language development, inclusive support programs and clubs, and diverse  instructional and personnel resources.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   When thinking about Rigorous Instruction, ELA Regents performance from the 2016-17 to the 2017-18 school year has  improved by 5%. We are very proud of this improvement as we begun to vertically align skills in the literacy classes to  build the capacity of student performance. We also showed a growth in Geometry, gaining a 17% increase for the  2017-18 school year from the year prior. When thinking about strong family ties, our 2018 school survey data showed  an increase of parent survey completion from 18% in the 2016-17 school year to 31% in the 2017-18 school year and  positive responses in parent outreach (94%) and parent involvement (88%) are noted. In the 2014-15 school year,  HSSL was rated developing in the area of Teacher Pedagogy 1.2 . For the 2016-17 school year, HSSL has received a  rating of proficient in this same area of Quality Review. We attribute this progress to the tremendous work we have  done in the areas of building coherence in unit planning, strategies for assessment, implementation of literacy  anchors across contents, and using the Universal Design Framework to ensure that learning needs of diverse students  are met. Thus, we have made the most progress in Rigorous Instruction on the Framework for Great Schools.  However, we are continually striving to improve and enhance this area.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 17K539   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   354   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent Involvement Policy    Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. 17K539, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The High School for Service  and Learning policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making  in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.       On October 27th 2016, The High School for Service and Learning conducted a meeting in which they discussed how  the school becomes Title 1 and alerted parents about having a Title 1 representative. At this meeting we discussed  what it meant to be a Title 1 school and how to elect a Title 1 community structure.    The High School for Service and Learning parents decided to have a parent sub committee of existing Parent  Association members as their Title 1 structure. Title 1 candidate elected was Serafina Coutain.            Our school will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38           Parents will be invited to "Purple Pride Parent Learning Series," in which they will be invited into classrooms   to what learning looks like within HSSL classrooms and will be provided with the opportunity to engage in  learning and ask questions     The School Messenger system and Skedula will be utilized to provide the school community with pertinent   information regarding upcoming school events and deadlines.

Our  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of our school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.          Parental Involvement and School Quality   In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, our school will:     provide opportunities for our HSSL families to visit classrooms during our Purple Pride Parent Learning Series      to assess the learning and engage in the days activities. This will serve as an opportunity parents to see the  learning happening at the school and provide feedback in the areas they see we can enhance.  reach parents through school messenger. While broadcasting information through the school messenger is a  useful tool for sharing important events and updates, we want to provide a forum for parents to interact with  the information.

The standalone classes are grouped according to the students  NYSITELL and NYSESLAT scores. One class is focused on the Entering ENL students who are  in need of a lot of scaffolding. The scaffolding for the entering group includes modified  materials, such leveled readings, additional visuals, translated texts, and extra explanations. The  second and third class are geared towards honing in on students academic language skills, with a  specific focus on supporting students with the ELA regents exam. These classes are for students  who have placed at the Emerging and Transitioning level on the NYSESLAT for the the 2017-18  school year. While these students will still need support in the form of modified texts, they will  significantly less scaffolding than the Entering students.     In addition to the primary ENL teacher there is one ENL/Social Studies certified teacher, Mr.  Cobb, who provides support for the 11th and 12 grade ELLs, most of whom have placed at the  Expanding or Commanding level on the 2017-18 NYSESLAT exam. Mr. Cobb provides support  in two integrated ELA/ENL classes and one Social Studies course five days a week for 45  minute periods. In order to provide additional support in building language for the more  advanced students Mr. Cobb provides additional explanations as well as native language support,  in French and Spanish. Mr. Cobb and Ms. Werner meet weekly to discuss students progress and  their needs going forward.   All instruction is in English with native language support in French/Haitian Creole, Spanish, and  Arabic, through the use of bilingual dictionaries and google translate.     For the past five years, the ENL population at the High School for Service and Learning (HSSL)  has exhibited the same trending need for further support and instruction in the modalities of  reading and writing.  As annually indicated on the RNMR, the majority of our students score  approximately one proficiency level lower on the NYSESLAT in reading and writing than they  do in speaking and listening.  In addition, our students have consistently expressed that both the  ELA Regents and the US/Global History Regents (all substantial writing-focused assessments)  provide the greatest challenge and concern for them as they make their way towards graduation  status. Given this data Mr. Cobb and Ms. Werner work with the content certified teachers in  order to assess students language needs.   In addition to regularly scheduled classes for ELLs, students may also attend our Extended Day  classes and Saturday Academy from 9:00am-1:10pm in order receive enrichment in literacy by  way of Global Studies and ELA Regents Prep courses.  We are holding a credit based program  that will be held two days a week after school, from 2:30pm to 4:30pm on Wednesday and  Thursday, and on Saturdays, from 9:00am to 1:10pm.  The after school and Saturday programs  will be offered in the Fall and/or Spring semester of the school year. The program is open to all  ELLs at the school, as well as former ELLs of up two years since passing the NYSESLAT.  The  after-school program will consist of direct reading and writing instruction in English, reading and  writing language activities, development of math and science skills, and provide students an  opportunity to gain support in areas of weakness.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45            Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   The primary ENL teacher, Ms. Werner, will also provide tutoring sessions once a week on  Wednesdays for 1 hour and she will attend the Saturday academy in order to support students,  and staff, to maximize on language development. During Saturday academy Ms. Werner will use  this time to work one-on-one with students as well to assist content teachers on how to scaffold  materials in order for students to access the content.

The professional  development will be designed and conducted by the ENL teacher and will be based on the  rationale for the Title III programs--that the reading and writing modalities continue to be the  biggest struggle for ELLs and former ELLs in meeting high school-level academic standards and  expectations in English; therefore, literacy should be a curriculum focus in every content area.    Topics to be covered include: Scaffolding Instruction and materials for ELLs across all contents,  and The Additive Approach, which explains how to incorporate students' Native Languages in  the classroom. The goal is to have at least three two-hour professional development sessions  throughout the year, with the first one to be held in October.     Instructional foci for 2018-2019 school year is on creating and supporting the effective  completion of literacy based tasks that require students to first show understanding, in writing, of  how to analyze content and provide appropriate evidence to then be able to better argue, make  claims and counterclaims, and to write with appropriate reasoning.  HSSL will work on the  Instructional Foci by focusing on unit development.  Within unit development, HSSL will focus  on planning for content and skill based learning that aligns to CCLS and Regents exams,  developing student academic behaviors, embedding Universal Design for Learning principles  and Literacy Anchors in instruction, and crafting diverse assessment to inform instruction.   HSSL's focus on Universal Design for Learning will provide teachers with the strategies  necessary to teach students that are ELLs and of diverse needs. Professional development will be  provided throughout the year on how to incorporate UDL and Literacy Anchors in lessons.    Also, the ENL teacher is currently scouting professional development for working with ELLs  that are SIFE students and for the Additive Approach for teaching ENL. These opportunities will  be of utmost help to the ENL teacher because it will help her reach her students that are in need  of the most help.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46         Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact  higher achievement for ELLs.  NOTE: These are in addition to mandated activities, such as  parent orientation during ELL identification process.     rationale       schedule and duration      name of provider    how parents will be notified of these activities   topics to be covered   Begin description here:               In addition to the initial parent orientation during the ELL identification process and the two  school-sponsored parent-teacher nights/afternoons throughout the year, parents of ELLs will be  invited to meet with the ENL twice a semester, a total of four times throughout the 2018-19  school year. The ENL teacher will utilize this time with parents to discuss students progress and  areas of need. The ENL teacher will also explain how parents can help support their child at  home.    Specific topics that will be addressed during these meetings include: requirements for  graduation, students successes and areas of need, and opportunities within the community  (outside of HSSL) for both parents and students.    Some opportunities that the ENL teacher plans to introduce to parent are the free English  conversation classes held at the Brooklyn Library once a week and the Brooklyn Library reading  and writing program for adults.    These topics are deemed important by the ENL teacher because it will help both students and  parents feel acclimated to their new country and environment.    Parents will be notified about these meetings by phone and letters sent home. Letters will be  translated into the parents native language.    During these parent meetings, Ms. Hillaire will be present to assist in translating for French and  Creole speaking parents. Additionally, the ENL teacher will utilize the 1-800 translation phone  number to reduce the language barriers with other languages.  The ENL teacher will work with parents of ELLs to develop a 'buddy system' for newcomer  students. This will help empower both parents and students who have been in New York for a  longer period of time and will also help new students and parents to feel more welcome in their  school community. A meeting for the 'buddy system' program will be held the first week of  school for parents and students to attend together and during that meeting together we will plan  how to implement a mentoring program for newly arrived ELLs.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47   Part E: Budget   FOR SCHOOLS NOT CONCEPTUALLY CONSOLIDATED ONLY.

Summative  assessments  are typically  done in the   form of   writing three   paragraph  essays and   presentations   in which   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51            0   0   0   0   Total        Part III: Assessment Analysis       0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   utilize the   target words   learned   throghout the   unit.  0   0   After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following:   1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  In order to properly asses whether or not students have mastered the objective, administration has provided teachers with  common planning time. All co-teachers have 8th period to plan and assess student work. In addition to daily common planning  time teachers are provided with PD's once a week focusing on how to accommodate ELLs.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Our program for ELLs is evaluated on an ongoing basis through both formal and informal means of assessment. Formally,  teachers and administration examine NYSESLAT results regarding both movement across levels and passing. In addition,  Regents Exam scores are considered, as well as graduation rates when evaluating the success of our ENL program.   Informally,  content area teachers and the ENL teacher communicate regularly through student inquiry meetings at both the grade and  department levels in which the progress of target populations, such as ELLs, is tracked.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Once summative data has been gathered, teachers assess what the deficits are and decide how to proceed. Co-teachers utilize  common planning time for this effort.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    N/A     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Analyses of data patterns indicate that LEP students in the 11th and 12th grades are more likely to test at a transitioning level,  or higher, of English proficiency across all modalities. For the 2016-2017 school year, the NYSITELL data showed that all of the  newcomers into the country had ELL status. All of them were in the entering or emerging level. This data determined how  many hours of standalone and integrated ENL the students would have. The NYSESLAT data aids the teachers in seeing the  students' progress from the NYSESLAT or the NYSITELL. In 2016-17, all students improved their scores, but analyzing the scores  in each of the modalities is necessary for each student. These results are shared with all teachers, in an effort for them to all be  teachers of ELLs, and to understand how each individual ELL student needs to be supported.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The ENL teacher administers the NYSESLAT in the Spring, with help from the testing coordinator. Once the test has been  administered, the ENL and ELA teachers grade and analyze the writing and speaking modalities together. Once the test has  been graded, the ENL teacher analyzes their speaking and writing scores from their NYSESLAT the prior year, or their  NYSITELL score from the beginning of the year. The ENL teacher analyzes their deficits and progress and determines a plan of  action for the future. Once the final NYSESLAT scores are posted on ATS in August, the ENL teacher continues to analyze their  progress in reading comprehension and listening. Analyzing these scores aids in lesson planning for standalone ENL classes, in  addition to providing support for content teachers.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52            7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   For the freestanding model, Entering and Emerging ESL students are grouped together and by grade level. The 9 th   and 10   th   grades are grouped together, and the 11  th   and 12  th   grades are grouped together, for both the 1.) Entering and  Emerging students and the 2.) Transitioning, Expanding and Commanding students. For the integrated model, students remain  in their appropriate grade level classes, and there is an ENL certified teacher pushing-in in the ELA and Social Studies classes.           Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   N/A      b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Students are programmed specifically to ensure that all required minutes are met, and ENL classes are designed in  such a way that all mandates are met in full. The Entering and Emerging ENL students are programmed for one stand  alone ENL class, one ELA class with a push-in ESL teacher, and one integrated ESL/social studies class per day, five  times a week. The Transitioning, Expanding, and Commanding students are programmed for one ELA class and one  integrated ESL/social studies class per day, five times a week.           2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Both, the ESL teacher and content area teachers, use a range of instructional methods to ensure that comprehension of  content is achieved coupled with English language enrichment. These include, among others, scaffolding of lessons, use of  visual aids, infusing art into the curriculum, drawing upon students personal interests and backgrounds, independent reading,  journaling, vocabulary development, read-alouds, think alouds, access to native language materials, graphic organizers,  manipulatives, and direct literacy strategy instruction. Although all instruction (with the exception of FL instruction) is  delivered in English, NL supports are provided and encouraged. NL supports include French, Haitian Creole, Spanish, Twi,  Bengali, Arabic, and Urdu. Co-teaching, with the content and ENL teachers, ensures that ELLs' materials are modified towards  the same Common Core objective as the general education students. Each of these aforementioned supports ensures that ELL  students are able to meet the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards.             3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   All students who are ELLs are given the opportunity to complete NYS Regents Exams (with the exception of ELA) in their native  languages. These exams are graded by a faculty member who is fluent in that language. Either the Spanish LAB-R or an  informal assessment in another language (designed in-house by a native speaker of that language) is given to newly admitted  students in addition to the NYSITELL when there is reason to believe the student's native language literacy is minimal. Results  of these assessments are communicated to all teachers, as well as possible strategies and scaffolds to implement in class.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?     a.  Educational interventions are written and implemented for all SIFE at HS for Service and Learning and are based on the  consistent communication between content area teachers, guidance counselors, and the ESL teacher in regards to the  students’ ongoing academic development.  The students’ strengths are drawn upon in planning curriculum and designing  differentiated means of assessment in the students’ classes so that the students are able to experience and exhibit significant  amounts of success throughout their academic careers.  In addition, these students are given the resources of extra tutoring  during and after school.    b. Newcomers participate in our Balanced Literacy program at HSSL.  In ESL class, the teacher models reading strategies for 10  minutes at the beginning of each reading session.  The students have to practice these reading strategies individually or in  pairs to improve their reading comprehension skills.  A library consisting of several genres for all levels of students is easily  accessible in the classroom. Students read these books in class and they take them home to read and complete story maps.  Students also improve their writing skills by writing memoirs, science fiction, and realistic fiction pieces.  Again, the teacher  models for the students before they are asked to write.  Whenever possible, art and music are included in the ESL curriculum.  In addition, Saturday Academy courses are offered to students who would like to earn more credits and better prepare  themselves for the standardized exams given in January and June, as well as after school tutoring and Regents prep  classes.  Many class activities and assignments are modeled after the ELA Regents tasks at the intermediate and advanced  levels of ESL; however, the tasks are scaffolded in a way that allows for students to build both linguistic and academic  proficiency simultaneously.    c.    In addition to using the Balanced Literacy Program, these students (4-6 years of ESL) are tracked academically by both the  ESL and content area teachers in order to determine the student's overall achievement. In addition, both the student's ESL  and ELA teachers identify the student's weakest linguistic modality--reading, writing, speaking or listening--via the NYSESLAT  results and additional formal and informal class assessments. Once the area in need of development is identified, the teachers  differentiate lessons and activities to specifically target that student's weakness.    d.   Programs have been created to help long-term ELLs achieve academic success.  After-school classes are offered for the  content area courses, such as history, English, math, and science.  Students are informed in writing and orally about these  important programs that will prepare them for Regents exams and/or give them opportunity to earn a credit. They  are encouraged to attend them by their ESL and content area teachers.  In addition, Saturday Academy classes are offered to  students who need extra support in their core academic classes.  These classes run from 9AM to 1:10PM on Saturdays.      e.   Former ELLs are in regular contact with the ESL teacher and still benefit from the ESL testing  accommodations.  Furthermore, former ELLS are scheduled for 90 minutes of integrated ESL a week as per CR Part 154.2 for 2  years after testing out. ELLs can test out by either testing proficient on the NYSESLAT, or testing as advanced on the NYSESLAT  and test at a level 3 or 4 on the ELA, or test advanced on the NYSESLAT and test 65 or higher on the English Regents. Many of  the former ELLs volunteer as tutors or mentors to newcomers in the third section of the beginner level ESL class.           5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Both the ESL and content area teachers implement a variety of instructional strategies, including scaffolding, content  modification, specific strategy interventions, manipulatives, graphic organizers, and resources and programs designed for this  particular group of students.  Within every lesson, delivery of instruction and the student product for assessment are  differentiated as appropriate using visual aids, computer programs (such as Khan Academy or Castle Learning), modeling, and  student choice.  The school ensures ELL-SWDs whose IEP mandates bilingual instruction receive an appropriate program   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      through scheduled meetings with the ESL teacher, IEP distributions and notifications and regular communication on each  student's progress. The LAP team meets regularly with the Instructional Supports team to find the most effective way to help  our ELL-SWDs access academic content and accelerate their English language development.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Scaffolding techniques are used to help them achieve academic excellence.  Lessons that target their strengths as well as their  weaknesses are utilized to help them become proficient in English.  They are included in all aspects of our school as well as in  our ESL classes.  In order to ensure that students have the least restrictive environment, flexible programming is used to  maximize time with non-disabled peers. Students are not tracked but rather have options for stand-alone ESL, ICT courses, as  well as resource room and general education courses.              7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  We offer after school tutoring to all ELLs on top of the self-contained/integrated ESL classes. Students also have access to peer  tutors in their native languages (e.g. Haitian Creole, French, Spanish, Arabic, etc.) throughout the day to aid in their acquisition  of the necessary skills and language to be able to thrive in various content areas.  In science, mathematics, and social studies  courses, bilingual dictionaries in the students' native languages are available for use and when possible, native language  resources and references in the content areas are provided to aid in student understandings for projects, essays, etc.  Student  use of computers to access native language materials is highly encouraged in math, science and social studies courses. ESL  students are given continual access to resource materials.  In addition, students are given bi-monthly progress reports in  content areas such as science, social studies, and mathematics so as to self-monitor and self-motivate through the assistance  of grade-level inquiry teams. One to two times a month, grade-level inquiry teams of teachers meet to discuss student grades,  classwork, participation, attendance records, graduation/college readiness and Regents readiness. Outreach is done for the  students identified as "in danger" of one of the aforementioned categories. Each teacher by grade level, including the ESL  teacher, becomes responsible for a handful of students with whom they communicate on a regular basis regarding a plan of  action and development.          8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Based on data from the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT ENL students have a deficit in reading and writing. Many students are  experiencing this deficit, because they lack foundational reading skills in their native language. Many students are not able to  read or write. Because of this severe deficit we have purchased System 44, which is an interactive web based phonics program  that asses, and provides students with individualized support based on their specific needs.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      There are no programs/services for ELLS  that will be discontinued.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   Comprehensive list of ESL students is shared with staff. There is an updated Google Drive spreadsheet, and students are  alerted by the LAP team when there is a new ESL student in the school. All students are offered and afforded access to all  available programs (including clubs, sport teams, leadership committee, after school classes and regents prep, etc.) at  HSSL.  The ESL teacher assists in the responsibility of communicating the activities and programs available at the school via an  information posting board in her classroom to which all ELLs have daily access and she regularly calls attention to as part of her  daily instruction.  Many of the activities are offered campus-wide due to the fact that there are five schools on the Erasmus  Campus. Therefore, the numerous activities are communicated to all students via flyers, letters home, and daily  announcements.  Announcements are broadcast during the third period for which the ESL teachers are with the beginning- level ESL students, so they regularly translate or ask a pedagogue fluent in the students' native language to translate the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      announcements for these students.  The ESL teachers are highly supportive of students' participation in extra-curricular  activities and serves as an advocate for these students to participate when talking to both parents and coaches.  Many of the  ELLs participate on the soccer and football teams, the after-school band and chorus, the leadership team, and in various  academic activities.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  We use a variety of materials to support the learning of ELLs.  We have a leveled library consisting of the following genres:  informational, realistic fiction, biography, autobiography and memoir, poetry, traditional literature, historical fiction, and  careers.  We also have audio-books that are used during reading workshop. Whenever possible, art, music and video are added  to enrich reading and writing workshops.  Books that come with software are also available for student use.  We use  technology presentations to facilitate ELLs learning.  Students view short films from other cultures to increase their  multicultural background knowledge. Utilizing Smartboard, Google Classroom, Rosetta Stone is used across the curriculum.  The materials required by the different subgroups often differ according to perceived need. For example, intermediate and  advanced students often request bilingual dictionaries to aid their comprehension, while beginner students often require fully  translated materials or abridged versions of texts.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.   Native language support is delivered in the self-contained/integrated ENL model through the strongly encouraged use of  bilingual dictionaries and supplemental materials (e.g. textbooks or novels in the native languages) when necessary.  Some  students who are struggling beginners are given the resource of a tutor in their native language.  The tutors are often former  ELLs and meet with the students who need assistance during common lunch periods in the ENL classroom. In the integrated  classes students are paired heterogeneously based on their English acquisition. This enables students to work together and  provides support for students at all levels.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   All required services, support and resources used are appropriate for high school students, from Entering to Commanding  levels of English language proficiency. Utilizing IEP goals and lists of accommodations, ENL teachers and instructional support  service team coordinate modification of lessons, texts, graphic organizers, exam format, leveled readings, and use of  manipulatives and multi-media resources to ensure that ENL-SWD students receive grade-level content in an appropriate  delivery method for their cognitive ability.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    We use a variety of materials to support the learning of ELLs.  We have a leveled library consisting of the following genres:  informational, realistic fiction, biography, autobiography and memoir, poetry, traditional literature, historical fiction, and  careers.  We also have audio-books that are used during reading workshop. Whenever possible, art, music and video are added  to enrich reading and writing workshops.  Books that come with software are also available for student use.  We use  technology presentations to facilitate ELL’s learning.  Students view short films from other cultures to increase their  multicultural background knowledge. Utilizing Smartboard, Google Classroom, Rosetta Stone is used across the curriculum.  The materials required by the different subgroups often differ according to perceived need. For example, intermediate and  advanced students often request bilingual dictionaries to aid their comprehension, while beginner students often require fully  translated materials or abridged versions of texts.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Prior to the beginning of the school year, the ENL teachers contact incoming ELLs and their parents/guardians, if the contact  information is available. This initial contact is attempted in order to welcome new students and their families to the school; to  introduce themselves (the ENL teachers); to answer any questions they may have; to notify them of upcoming school events,  such as new student orientation; and to inform them of available services, such as translation services.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56         16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Spanish is currently offered to ELLs as a language elective.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    N/A        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   As per the UFT contract, Monday afternoons are used for professional development activities. Present at  these sessions are the pedagogues, special education teachers, speech therapists, occupational/physical  therapists, and secretaries.  The professional development programs are based on the belief that all  teachers are teachers of language arts and that English as a Second Language is a natural extension of  English language arts.  All teachers who teach ELLs are offered to attend several professional  development workshops in ENL methodology throughout the course of the year.  Among these  workshops have been: ELA Regents Support for ELLs, QTEL Workshops, Differentiated Instruction for ELLs,  Strategies for the Success of Secondary ELLs, and Targeting and Identifying SIFE.   The information  acquired at these workshops is then shared with all other teachers at collaborative meetings where the  new information and strategies are turn-keyed, discussed and then implemented.The ENL teachers meet  either one on one with a teacher who has requested assistance and training for ELLs or with one  particular academic department, such as the social studies teachers.  In these Monday meetings, teachers  discuss the students specifically, the target material to be learned, and the various strategies that can be  implemented to support the ENL students in achieving comprehension and academic ability.   The ESL teachers work closely with ELA teachers in common planning time to engage in current work with  the Common Core Standards and align her ESL curriculum plans to the standards. During common  planning time, ESL teachers complete lesson studies and craft Common-Core aligned interventions to  address student-skill deficits as identified interim assessments. The veteran guidance counselors are  continually searching for available outside supports and opportunities of which they inform all ELLs, often  through the ESL teacher.  Many of our ELLs have attended free off-campus SAT preparation classes for  ELLs and college-readiness workshops as a result.        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  All 9th grade teachers receive professional development at the beginning of the year on aiding incoming students from middle  school with the transition process to high school. At these sessions, teachers are exposed to methods for aiding ENL students  in a content area classroom. These teachers review graphic organizers, multi-media text, appropriate uses for home language   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57         translation and dictionaries, modification of assessment and materials, and proper grouping strategies. This is particularly  important and effective for working with ELLs, as it suggests that more scaffolding, repetition, and modeling may be required  for these students as they become acclimated to the high school environment. The ENL teacher meets with other teachers  during PD time at the beginning of the fall and spring semesters to review pertinent data on ENL students, and to review  proper introduction and programming as turn-keyed from Affinity Group Professional Developments for ENL students.  All teachers who teach ELLs are trained in the Balanced Literacy workshop model.  They teach the students reading and writing  strategies in every lesson. Content teachers are introduced to textbooks that are at the reading levels of ELLs.  Teachers learn  effective methods of teaching ELLs new vocabulary words.  Teachers of humanities work cooperatively to create an  interdisciplinary curriculum for ELLs.  Thus, the reading and writing strategies that students are learning in history, ENL, foreign  language, and English classes are reinforced.  Science and math teachers also work cooperatively to create an interdisciplinary  curriculum.  In addition, teachers learn about the students’ cultures at professional development workshops.  This knowledge  is used by teachers to better communicate with newcomers, as well as to help students adapt to American culture. Records of  staff professional development, including Monday meeting small groups PDs, are kept on file by both department and grade- level teams.                  2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  1. Parents/guardians of all students are invited to attend a PTA meeting approximately once a month.  In addition to letters  home, a phone messenger system is used to inform the parents of ENL students of upcoming meetings. A school aide, Ms.  Hillaire is fluent in Haitian-Creole and French and is able to translate for in person meetings with parents. An ELA teacher, Ms.  Juarez and a special education teacher, Ms. Reyes, are able to provide translations for Spanish-speaking parents. When  translations are needed in any other languages, a student or parent of a student who speaks the target language is called upon  for assistance. Otherwise, the available DOE interpretation and translation services are utilized.  All informative handouts for  parents are available in English, Spanish, French, Haitian Creole, Bengali, Urdu, and Arabic.  At the meetings, parents are  informed about their children’s workload, academic goals, and progress, as well as how they can assist the children in meeting  their goals and/or in making the adjustment to an English speaking environment as easy as possible. This information is  presented in both English and the representative native languages.        Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Parents/guardians of all students are invited to attend a PTA meeting once a month. Parents are also invited to meetings about  immigration, college readiness, and the like. These activities keep the parents/guardians informed and involved in the ELLs'  education. Parent coordinator meets and greets new families and provides them with introductory materials in their home  language, and she arranges for parental outreach in home language when students are identified as at risk. The ENL teacher  coordinates parent meetings for newcomers to educate parents on the New York Education system and what their program at  our school will look like. The ENL teacher is provided with one hour every Tuesday to call parents and discuss their students  progress. All teachers have been provided with the 24 hour 1-800 translation phone number, provided by the DOE, to help  avoid any language barrier.           2.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, High School for Service and Le, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and  activities are adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   17k539                                                                              School DBN: Josephine Van-Ess  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

Yes/No       (*Primary)             * The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs  on translation,   interpretation, compliance and budget.      School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      There are two main types of translation needs at our school:     a. Written: Documents - birth certificates, transcripts, health records, court documents etc. These documents  are translated by school staff fluent in the language. In cases of transcripts where the amount of credits and  subject area is often not clear, documents are faxed to approved NYCDOE Translation and Interpretation Unit for  processing.ENL teacher and guidance counselors created a shared Google Sheets file that is updated on a bi- monthly basis.    b. Oral: Spoken translation for non-English speaking adults and students. Many of the parents and students  arriving from non-English speaking countries speak only their native language. Upon entering the school, the  guidance counselor identifies the language spoken by the family and enrolls the help of a translator. At present,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62      we have native speakers of Haitian-Creole, French, Spanish, Russian and Urdu. Another important aspect of our  translation needs is the fact that we do not have a bilingual program (not enough students in any grade level).  Students are taught in core subject areas in English and many times other students translate for newcomers.    Parent/guardians' language preferences are determined by the Home Language Identification Surveys, Student  Emergency Contact Cards, and ATS Bio Reports, Blue Card data, the ATS Report of Preferred Languages, Teacher  Surveys, and Parent Surveys.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     Written Preferred    Percent Written          Oral Preferred    Percent Oral          Language    Haitian Creole, French,  Spanish, Arabic,  English, Urdu, and  Bengali            3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.            Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services    1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be   How do you plan to translate?

Translation requests will be sent 2  weeks before these meetings.            interpretation service(s)?       3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.               Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure    Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.                Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      The ESL teacher and office staff provide each parent, whose primary language is a covered language and who requires  language assistance services, with written notification of their rights regarding translation and interpretation services  in the appropriate covered language, and instructions on how to obtain such services.    All notification documents can be accessed at the Translation and Interpretation Unit's intranet site.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64         Twice a year parents/guardians of ELLs will be administered a survey in their home language about how they interpret  the quality and availability of the services provided to them. A focus group will be held of parents inclusive of all  cultures and languages represented in our school to gather feedback and best practices on the quality of services  provided.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65
