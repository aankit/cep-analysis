This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          6     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?       The mission of Jonas Bronck Academy is to shape an intimate, supportive, engaging school community-where parents  are partners; where teachers inspire learning with passion and commitment; and where the staff models – and all the  scholars develop and live – our core values of respect, integrity and dignity.  Jonas Bronck Academy goal is to provide the academic and character-building skills our scholars need to graduate  from leading colleges, to succeed in a competitive world, and to serve as the next generation of leaders of their   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8      communities. Our school vision is to “create an environment where scholars challenge, question, and learn to find  answers”.     In this environment, students feel safe, supported, and understand the importance of community. An example of this  is how we revamped our Scholar Council election so that both candidates and voters can experience the campaign  process in an authentic way. Scholar candidates wrote an interest essay and submitted documentation to prove their  commitment to being a representative of the school. Once candidates were determined they had to participate in an  extensive campaign which included: mingling with parents and staff to gain support during Coffee and Conversation,  preparing to present over a three week period to the different grades their responses to their debate question, and  creating materials to display and use during their campaign. The school population then partook in electing their  representatives which included displaying their school ids to enter the election booths and voting on school  propositions that could affect their uniform for the next year. At Jonas Bronck Academy we strive to provide scholars  with real world practices in order to clearly promote respect, integrity and dignity as a way of reinforcing positive  citizenship outside of the school environment.      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   Jonas Bronck is a college preparatory school of choice created in 1997 as a response to the rapid influx of students to  Community School District 10. Concerned parents of The Bronx New School (P.S. 51) worked with Manhattan College  faculty, the Department of Education, and local community officials to create a middle school on the campus of  Manhattan College. In 2009 a new chapter began when the school relocated to the fourth and fifth floors of a state of  the art two story school.   Jonas Bronck Academy enjoys partnerships with a multitude of respected organizations within the community:     Dancing Classroom provides Jonas Bronck scholars with social awareness, confidence, and self-esteem      through the art of dance.  Learning Through an Expanded Arts Program (LeAp) is the community based organization we have partnered  with to provide our scholars extra curricular activities during after school hours. Activities offered consist of,  but are not limited, to cooking, graphic design, theater, dance and mask making. We also have partnered up  with them to provide in-class extension in literacy and science for the 6th grade.     Urban Advantage provides our science teachers with professional development that supports their ability to  increase inquiry in the sciences. As well as resources and access to the cities museums, aquarium, botanical  gardens and zoos.  Fordham University partnership provides Social Work Interns to grow in their craft by working with our  scholars so that more scholars get the personalized attention as they transition through the different phases  of adolescent development.  Fordham Liberty Partnership provides our scholars with academic support such as tutoring.       Bronx Lebanon Hospital holds an after school program called "Picture the Possibilities" which provides  scholars with strategies to improve interaction with peers, decision making skills, problem solving skills,  communication and socialization skills.  Insurgo is a non-profit organization working to educate our scholars on nutrition and provides our students  with a farm to table experience. Their focus is to secure food access for high-need communities and goal is to  merge local farms, local restaurants, and local Chefs with local residents to sponsor environmental  sustainability and economic growth.                     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      NA         3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The elements of the Framework for Great Schools that we made the most progress over this past year were in  building Strong Family-Community Ties, Trust, Supportive Environment and Collaborative Teachers. We have made  significant gains in each of these elements over the last year and the last few years in my Principalship. This year  particularly, we have really honed in on establishing strong ties with our families and our community. We have also  proactively worked creating a supportive and collaborative environment here at Jonas Bronck Academy. I believe that  Jonas Bronck Academy has achieved a level of mutual trust amongst each other and with our families.   We would like to continue working on developing strong and rigorous instruction that is inclusive and engaging to all  of our scholars. We want to make sure that everyone can access the curriculum and feels supportive throughout the  year.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 10X228   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   268   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

We want our scholars to feel supported at all levels of their middle school career and to know when to ask  for help. We also want them to receive stellar support from all of our staff members. We want to expand our advisory  and counseling program during the 2017-2018 school year to ensure that scholars are working towards their own  personal growth and viewing their high school selections early. With greater exposure to the high school  requirements for the schools of their choosing, students can work to fit the criteria and become a better match to get  into the school of their choice. This model will allow both an academic and a social/emotional approach to their goals  and needs.   .

Data Sources  ● Quality Review  ● PPR  ● Teacher feedback  Teachers at Jonas Bronck Academy have spent the last few years helping establish a culture where teachers have  virtual inter-visitations with one another via videos. We found that the feedback and collaboration would be stronger  if we added several components, one of them being their ability to reflect on their lesson plan both before and after  the video. We want to help establish a system where teachers can reflect on their lessons before there are recorded  and then once again after they are recorded and “inter-visited”. This will allow teachers to receive feedback from  their colleagues on ways that they can improve in the future.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Column B   Verify with an (X)   Section Reference(s)   Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local   216,498.00     0    0    0    1,798,013.00     X             X                     1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          31     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          32      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Jonas Bronck, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      Jonas Bronck Academy will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ∙ providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ∙ providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ∙ fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ∙ providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ∙ sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33      ∙ providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.      In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ∙ actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ∙ engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated directly  to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ∙ ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ∙ support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;   ∙ maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ∙ conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;   ∙ provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State accountability  system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning  Environment Survey Report;   ∙ host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ∙ schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning or  evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ∙ translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;   ∙ conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ∙ holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ∙ hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ∙ encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ∙ supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ∙ establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ∙ encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ∙ providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their children’s  progress;   ∙ developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ∙ providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.      School-Parent Compact (SPC)   Jonas Bronck Academy , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act  (ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student  achievement between the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and  programs funded by Title I, agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will  share responsibility for improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will  be developed to ensure that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35   I.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  In addition to the NYSITELL and the NYSESLAT, students are administered the Degrees of Reading Power (DRP) assessment to  determine their literacy skills.   This assessment provides a holistic measure of how well students are able to process  information and how well they are able to understand complex text.  We also administer a baseline exam to all students to  assess their skills in the four modalities.  As a measure of tracking reading levels we also incorporate Performance Series to  support in identifying areas of need, as the system is designed to fit to student individual reading level. We use the data  gathered to create an instructional plan for each student and set individualized goals for them according to their level.  This  data is extremely useful when teachers plan because this information can assist them in their choice of text, how they will  group students and the types of scaffolding that will be needed to grant the students access to their grade level material.          2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41         We have created a reading program that takes place in the beginning of the day where the ELLs are given most of these  assessments.  The ENL teacher works closely with the ELLs during this period throughout the year to ensure that the students  are given ample time in the appropriate setting to complete these assessments.  There are also anecdotals taken throughout  the year to monitor the students' progress.  These notes help the ENL teacher to prepare individual scaffolds that cater to the  needs of each individual ENL student based on their progress.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Through extensive data analysis of baseline exams, benchmark exams, NYSESLAT data, formative and summative assessments,  we are able to pinpoint specific areas of student need.  These assessments give us specific areas of learning that the students  struggle with and help us to target our interventions on those topics.  There is always room for making changes and improving  our programs to ensure the most effective learning experience for our students.  Improving overall performance, particularly  in literacy, is one of our main focuses this year for our ELL population.  There have been many changes to our program and the  way we are targeting intervention in our school, specifically our RTI plan and extended day as per PROSE application.  As we  continue to analyze the data, we will constantly change our focus to ensure the most beneficial learning experience for not  only our ELLs and former ELLs but for all of our students.  We are working collaboratively as a staff to have each child reach  their maximum potential.          4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    The ENL teacher reviews the data on an ongiong basis.  She then meets with grade teams and discusses the students' progress  with their content area teachers.  Adaptations are made based on the needs of individual students and their progress based on  the summative assessments and are used by the content area teachers in their classrooms.  The ENL teacher also scaffolds  materials for these individuals for their content area classes based on their needs.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   We tier the students based on their performance series data.  The tier III ELL students are then placed in a specialized reading  class with the ENL teacher.  In this setting they are provided with individualized instruction based on their specific needs.  They  are given small group intensive instruction to assist with their needs and to try and address any deficits that they may have  based on their reading assessment and anecdotals kept by the ENL teacher on a daily basis     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The majority of our students tested expanding on the NYSESLAT exam.  This shows that they are advanced in their language  skills but are struggling to make it to the commanding(proficient) stage of their language acquisition stage.  The majority of the  students also scored a 1 or a 2 on both the NYS ELA and math exams.  Based on this information, the students need scaffolding  and instruction that will help them advance to the commanding stage of language acquisition.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Due to the new guidelines of CR Part 154.2, the majority of the students are serviced in their content area classes.  Due to their  scoring expanding on the NYSESLAT, the students are able to perform well in their classes but need assistance with acess to  difficult texts or assistance with keeping their writing on grade level.  The ENL teacher uses these findings to help adjust lesson  plans and materials to scaffold to the needs of each individual student.  With these services being provided during the ENL  programming, the students have the materials necessary to help them stay on task and keep up with the demands of the grade  level curriculum.

How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   As per the CR Part 154.2, our ELL population is served by using the integrated ENL teaching model.  We have one  student who tested as transitioning in the 6  th   grade and so he is serviced in his ELA class.  The majority of our ELL  population tested expanding and so they are being serviced in their content area classes.  These students are placed  heterogeneously in their classes but they are serviced by an ENL teacher in the appropriate setting for their mandated  number of minutes.  All students are placed in their classes based on their grade level and not their proficiency level.     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A    c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A        2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?             Based on charts 5.1 and 5.2, our students who tested as transitioning are receiving all of their mandated minutes in an  integrated ENL model.  They are being serviced in their ELA class for one unit of study (180 minutes) per week.  Our ELL  population who tested as expanding are receiving their integrated ENL services of one unit of study (180 minutes) per week  either during their ELA or their social studies class.  Our former ELL population of students who tested as commanding (within  the past two years) are serviced for their mandated time of half a unit of study per week (90 minutes) during their content  area classes.  These instructional minutes are delivered in the integrated ENL model during either their ELA or social studies  classes.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.     Content is delivered in the freestanding ENL program by incorporating ENL strategies into the lessons based on the Common  Core Standards.  ELLs and former ELLs reach proficiency by being provided with a language objective, based on the Common  Core Learning Standards, that they are expected to meet by the end of each class.  Content area teachers, with the help of ENL  teachers, modify the material so it is comprehensible for the ELLs.  Teachers introduce new vocabulary prior to the lesson so  the students are familiar with the new words, model activities, use visuals, graphic organizers and realia; relate instruction to  students prior knowledge, and offer home language support through their classroom libraries with bilingual texts.  Each  student's home language will be represented in the classroom library.             4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?     After enrolled, all Spanish speaking students will be given the Spanish LAB to help support us in instructional  planning.  Students will continue to receive assessments in their home language whenever possible to help keep a strong  foundation in their home language..           5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43      Instruction is differentiated for ELL subgroups in a variety of ways.  We currently have one SIFE student at Jonas Bronck  Academy. In order to best work with our Student with Interrupted Formal Education, we have created individualized materials  personalized to fit this student’s learning needs.  The ENL teacher works closely with this student to ensure that he is not  falling behind in the curriculum.  This student’s needs are addressed individually and in small group to bridge any gaps in his  skill base.  He is also scheduled to meet with the school social worker on a regular basis to further discuss and issues or  concerns he is experiencing.  It is extremely important to ensure that this student is adjusting to the school setting and is  comfortable in his learning environment to maximize his potential for learning.  At Jonas Bronck Academy, the primary goal is  to promote the rapid acquisition in English and student learning by providing immediate access to essential content  instruction.  At Jonas Bronck Academy we have structures in place to provide successful cultural adjustment to ensure the  acclimation of newcomers into their new learning environment.  For newcomers, instruction is implemented through total  physical response and with a strong use of visuals and realia.  These methods of instruction enable the newcomer to  participate and engage the student in the lesson.  The content area material is made comprehensible through the  collaboration of the content area and ENL teachers to ensure learning is taking place in all areas.  These methods are also  implemented with the ELL students who have been receiving instruction for 4 to 6 years.   These ELL students will receive their  madated ENL minutes through the co-teaching model and also small group sessions when necessary.  The ENL teacher will  collaborate with content area teachers to help them create language objectives for each lesson.  Vocabulary will be pre-taught  and studied before it is presented in class.  These students will also receive adapted materials in the classroom to ensure  comprehension of material.  By explicitly monitoring this group of ELLs with daily tracking of their progress based on the  Common Core Learning Standards, their areas of deficiency will be noticed.  By targeting the areas of struggle, the students  will be able to master these areas effectively.  These areas of deficiency will also be targeted during academic intervention  provided by the ENL teacher.  To address the needs of our long term ELLs, we are implementing one on one tutorial sessions  with the ENL teacher and counseling from our guidance staff.  There is also a tutoring system in place during lunch specifically  for the long-term ELLs and former ELLs.  During that time, the ENL teacher works with the students on acquiring academic  vocabulary and scaffolding any content area material that they are struggling with.  Former ELLs will be serviced during the day  either in a small group setting or in their content area classes by a certified ENL teacher.  They will continue to receive  scaffolds and testing modifications to ensure that their transition from ELL status to mainstream is a smoooth one.  Data  analysis is done for all subgroups to see where they are having difficulty.  These areas are then focused on during targeted  intervention in both the classroom and during small group instruction.  Each area will be focused on over the course of the  year by the school Language Proficiency Team to ensure they are receiving all of the support that they need.                 6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Teachers of ELL students with disabilities provide a number of strategies that help these students develop their language skills  while also helping them access the academic content.  There is an integration of content area and ENL instruction, specifically  vocabulary instruction, extended response, and predictable classroom routines and activities.  The ENL teacher scaffolds  materials daily for these students to help make their learning and language target attainable and to assist them to focus on the  specific task they are learning.  We try to incorporate students with disabilities in the least restrictive environment by looking  at what services the student needs depending on their disability and to support their progress in the curriculum.  The ENL  teacher, content area teachers and Special Education teachers collaborate frequently to ensure that these students’ needs are  being met.  We also ensure that all ELL-SWD are provided with their mandated testing accommodations.             7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Due to the fact that we have a rather small ELL population in our school, the ENL teacher is able to closely monitor the ELL- SWDs to help them achieve their IEP goals.  The ENL teacher is a part of the School Implementation Team which meets  regularly to discuss the ELL-SWDs IEP goals and creates and action plan for them for the school year.  The team reviews each  individual students' IEP in the beginning of the year and after any IEP meetings or changes to their IEP have been made.  The  students strengths, weaknesses and specific IEP goals are monitored closely by the Language Profiency Team.  These students  are given the opportunity to work specifically on their individual goals both in small group and with one on one teacher  conferencing with the ENL teacher.  There are also extra help sessions set up before and after school for these students to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44      meet with the ENL teacher to work on their specific areas of need.                8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  As the majority of our students are developing ELLs, we created our ENL program with these students needs in mind.  The  Language Proficiency Team focuses on developing an engaging and rigorous curriculum that will help our developing ELLs  achieve English language proficiency.  The NYSESLAT data revealed that most of our scholars lack proficiency in both Reading  and Writing. Thus, there is a strong focus on writing in their targeted instruction.  This instruction builds on the ELLs strengths  by incorporating numerous collaborative activities and ensuring that scholars have a daily opportunity to utilize their strong  listening and speaking skills.  The teacher differentiates by learning style and interest to help engage scholars in the writing  process.  Lessons are scaffolded to build students’ background knowledge and provide models of writing to give students  something to aspire to. The ENL teacher has frequent conferences with all of the ENL students.  During this conferencing  session, the students go over their content area classes and progress with the ENL teacher.  During this conference, we  pinpoint the highest areas of need and focus on those areas first.  We then follow up with that content teacher either in  person or via email to discuss a plan of action to try and improve their progress.  There is also extra help given by the ENL  teacher at least once a week to spend additional time working on the specific course of action each individual student was  given.  All ELL scholars also participate in the Advisory program where they receive daily support in small group  sessions.  During advisory, the students focus on socio-emotional aspects as well as their academic progress.  The former ELLs  are given this same service and are given the option to participate in all extra help and support programs that are offered to  the current ELLs.            9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      With the implementation of the new CR-Part 154, we will be shifting to an integrated ENL model.  Within this model the ENL  teacher and ELA teacher will work cohesively towards making the curriculum accessible to all students while providing a high  level of rigor.         10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   NA        11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All programs at JBA are accessible to all students regardless of their needs.  Students are given multiple support sessions  throughout the week to meet with their content area teacher or the ENL teacher for extra help.  During these sessions, they  can work with their teacher on homework, projects, or on any other assignments that they are given.  They can also stay after  school and be a part of any homework help session, which are targeted based on content.  Many of our scholars take  advantage of our extra-curricular activities such as band, chorus, scholar council, yearbook, art club, basketball, track and field,  fencing, fitness and other programs where they can continue to practice their English language skills in a social setting.  We  also offer specific after school programs in ELA, math, science and science regents prep courses and test prep courses.  These  programs are given to students to help them enhance their skills while also preparing them for success on their state  exams.              12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  For the past few years, we have been implementing the Expeditionary Learning Curriculum in all of our ELA classes which  provides scaffolding tools that assists students in their reading and writing comprehension.  This curriculum is adapFor the past  two years, we have been implementing the integrated ENL model in which the ENL and content area teachers have been  working together to scaffold materials that assist the ENL students in their content area classes, particularly in their reading  and writing comprehension.  This curriculum is adapted and scaffolded by the ENL teacher to ensure that all ELL students are  given access to the curriculum and are able to keep up with their native English speaking peers.  There is also the use of   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      Smartboard technology and document cameras in every classroom to address all different types of learning styles.  ted and  scaffolded by the ENL teacher to ensure that all ELL students are given access to the curriculum and are able to keep up with  their native English speaking peers.  There is also the use of Smartboard technology and document cameras in every classroom  to address all different types of learning styles.          13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   While we currently are only implementing the ENL program model at Jonas Bronck Academy, we will provide home language  support to the students in a variety of ways.  Each classroom has a cultural center that is dedicated to the home languages of  our scholars.  This area will have materials, artifacts, vocabulary and any other items that help students identify with their  home language.  There will also be materials provided in the child's home language to help support vocabulary acquisition in  both the home language and English.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    The required service supports and resources are aligned to the students' ages and grade levels.  In class, they are reading text  that iThe required service supports and resources are aligned to the students' ages and grade levels.  In class, they are reading  text that is often above their grade level.  If this material is above their individual reading level, the ELA and ENL teacher  scaffold the material to make it comprehensible to the learner.  The reading may also be done in a small group setting with the  ENL teacher to ensure comprehension.  There are also libraries in every classroom that have reading materials on a number of  grade levels.  There are also reading materials available in each student's home language.  Students are encouraged to take  materials from the classroom libraries to read during their reading period or on their own time.  In this way, the students are  reading at their own personal lexile level and also reading material that is on their current grade level.  This prepares them  best to make the transition into the next grade levels often above their grade level.  If this material is above their individual  reading level, the ELA and ENL teacher scaffold the material to make it comprehensible to the learner.  The reading may also  be done in the small group setting with the ENL teacher to ensure comprehension.  There are also libraries in every classroom  that have reading materials on a number of grade levels.  There are also reading materials available in each student's home  language.

If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    na     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   In the summer before the school year begins, the incoming ELLs are required to attend an orientation with their parents.  This  orientation helps the students and their families learn more about Jonas Bronck Academy.  They receive a tour of the building  and also are given presentations from both administration and teachers in regards to our values and the expectations at Jonas  Bronck Academy.  There is also a picnic that is hosted by Jonas Bronck Academy that invites all students and their parents to  attend.  Teachers and administrators are invited so that everyone can become better acclimated to the new environment  before the start of the new school year.  This is a great way to ensure that both students and parents feel comfortable with the  new learning environment they are entering.  There is also a summer program for incoming 6th graders in both ELA and in  math.  This program targets students, specifically ELLs, to make sure they have the skills necessary to be able to adjust to  the   6th grade curriculum expectations.  There is also an orientation class given to these students to help them understand the  rules and procedures that are expected to be followed at Jonas Bronck Academy.  These courses give the students a chance to  build relationships with other incoming students and the teachers that they will have in September.  This foundation helps the  ELLs acclimate to the school culture which makes their transition into middle school a smooth process.      the summer before  the school year begins, the incoming ELLs are required to attend an orientation with their parents.

Students at Jonas Bronck Academy are offered Italian as an elective.  As most of our students are Spanish speakStudents at  Jonas Bronck Academy are offered Italian as an elective.  As most of our students are Spanish speaking, these additional  language skills can be extremely helpful.  A solid foundation in their home language enables a much smoother transitioning  process into their second language.  When they learn how language works, they can apply things that they learn in their  foreign language elective class to learning any new language, including English.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The ENL teacher attends professional development, on at least a monthly basis, as offered by the DOE and the network.  The  ENL teacher turnkeys professional learning to the rest of the staff, including but not limited to, assistant principals, subject  area teachers, paraprofessionals, guidance counselors, special education teachers, psychologists, secretaries and parent  coordinators, at school and team meetings on a periodic basis. Topics of focus include strategies for ELLs, writing and  supporting language objectives and learning targets, building ELLs background knowledge, and academic language in the  content area. Upcoming professional developments are highlighted in the weekly emails updates.  The professional  development topics that will be covered include but are not limited to: SIOP Strategies in the Content Areas, Making Content  Comprehensible for ELLs, Testing Accommodations for ELLs, Vocabulary Acquisition and Scaffolding in Content Area  Classes.  The ENL teacher will be administering the majority of the professional development sessions.  The ENL teacher will  also be attending the monthly special-education meetings reviewing data and discussing the needs of the special education  ELLs and how their needs can best be addressed in the classroom.  School secretaries also attend additional professional  developments to stay abreast of all updates to data systems such as ATS. The ENL teacher has been provided a number of PD’s  to help make the transition into using the Common Core Learning Standards and adapting them to meet the needs of the  ELLs.  The ENL teacher is also a part of the ELA and Social Studies content area teams in the school.  During this time, we often  discuss the Common Core Learning Standards that we are focusing on, track data on how each student is doing by standard,  and provide scaffolding strategies and techniques so that all students are provided equal access to the material.  The school  social worker and guidance counselor attend numerous events throughout the year to train her on how to best assist ELLs  when they are transitioning to high school.  We have also established numerous relationships with schools that specialize in  working specifically with the ELL population.  This helps her place each student in the most suitable setting for that individual  child.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47         2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  All content area teachers of ELLs are encouraged to attend professional development and other workshops to help support the  ENL population in their classroom.  Teachers are encouraged to attend workshops in groups, so that as a cohort, they can more  successfully integrate new skills and knowledge into our school culture.  The ENL teacher also gives numerous PDs and holds  work sessions throughout the year.  These workshops and seminars ensure that all staff receives at least the minimum amount  of hours as per CR Part 154:2.  Records will be maintained in an ENL Professional Development Binder.  This information will be  kept by the ENL Coordinator.            Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   The Language Allocation Team will coordinate the scheduling of annual individual meetings with the parents of the ELLs to  discuss their child's goals, their language development process and their assessment results.  These meetings will be scheduled  at the beginning of the year to begin to build a bond and an open line of communication between the parents and the  school.  Translations will be provided for all parents in their home language.  These meetings will be followed up with phone  conversations, emails and other preferred methods of communication throughout the year to keep an open and constant line  of communication between the school and the parents.       2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Parents of ELLs tend to be very involved in school activities at Jonas Bronck Academy and turnout at parent events is  traditionally high.  We have Talk and Tea once a month where the parents can come in and speak with the students teachers  and enjoy tea and light snacks.  It is a time where the parents can really bond with the teachers and discuss any questions or  concerns they might have.  We also have a cultural day where families bring in food from their home country and share with  the students and the staff.  It is a time where we celebrate everyones culture and it is an event that all members of the school  community look forward to every year.  Members of the Language Proficiency Team are proficient in both English and Spanish  and communicates with parents of ELLs frequently by phone, in person, and through a newsletter that is distributed both to  the students and via e-mail to all parents.  If any other language translation is needed, we make sure to provide that for the  parents in need.  All school documents are available in English and Spanish.  Translation is available at all school events.

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:                                                                                   School DBN:     Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      After reviewing all of our Home Language Identification Surveys (HLIS) as well as informal interviews with parents  done by our parent coordinator, we concluded that we have a great need for documents to be translated into  Spanish. Any documentation that is needed in other native languages is translated or we ensure that those  parents are contacted and given all information through a translator. Surveys are also sent home at the beginning  of the year and the parent's home language is filled out. This documentation is kept in each student's file to  ensure that all parents are given information in the appropriate language. All information taken from the Home  Language Identification Surveys is input into ATS by our Pupil Accounting Secretary. We also used ATS data such  as the Adult Preferred Language Report (RAPL) to find out the home language of each parent in the student's  household.            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51     2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.

Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      When students first enter our school community we will make their families aware of their right to receive information in their home language by providing them with the parent’s guide to language access multilingual brochure. This will   take place during open house and orientation. Our parent coordinator has a close relationship with all families and she will also inform each family of their right to have information translated into their home language. All   parents/guardians are also welcome at the school leadership team meetings that take place once a month. We will discuss the need to provide translation services to all families during the first meeting of the school year and make sure      At out school, communication is key. We often send phone messages home through the school messenger which calls parents directly with the number that they have provided telling them about important information in regards to our   school community. In the event of a school emergency, we have all parents contacted by school messenger. If it is an emergency pertaining to one specific student, the parent/guardian will be contacted directly from someone at the  school in their home language. If that language is not spoken by one of our staff members we will use the translation phone service to translate the information.               Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure    Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      Based on the Chancellor's Regulation A-663, we will fulfill parental notification requirements for translation and interpretation services by hanging the welcome poster from the Language Access Kit in a visible place where all parents   entering the building will be able to see it. We will also make sure to provide copies of the Parent's Bill of Rights and the Parent's Guide to Language Access to all parents so that they are aware of their rights to translation. We will also   make sure that all school safety agents and school secretaries are given the Language ID Guide. These members of our staff are the first ones to greet parents as they enter our school. By having access to the Language ID Guide, they will      be able to best meet the needs of the parents in a timely fashion. We will also provide all members of our staff with the Translation and Interpretation brochure and the Language Palm Card so that they are aware of the resources that   that this information is being delineated to all family members of students at Jonas Bronck Academy.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       To generate feedback from parents on the quality and availability of translation and interpretation services provided  at Jonas Bronck Academy, we will administer a survey. In this survey the parents will be able to comment on how they  feel about the communication that takes place in our school community. There will be a space for parents to make  suggestions on how we can create even better ways of communicating with our families and parents both on student  progress and on events that are taking place. We will also schedule a focus group of parents that will be inclusive of all  the cultures and languages that are represented in our school to gather ideas, feedback, and best practices.             2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54
