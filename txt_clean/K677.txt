This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Section 4: CEP Overview            Our mission here at PS 677 is to develop high achieving, critical thinkers in a safe, risk free environment. We see our  school as a community where all members, students, staff and parents create an atmosphere where learning,  creativity and participation take place. Ideally all members will work cooperatively utilizing all resources (libraries,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      museums, community based organizations, etc.) in and out of the community in order to enable our students to  become lifelong learners and active participants in our school and our society. The students will develop decision  making skills, critical thinking skills and the ability to communicate effectively.            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Public School 677 is located in the East New York section of Brooklyn, New York. This Pre-kindergarten to fifth grade  (PK-5) school serves a population of approximately 570 students from diverse backgrounds. The school is a central  part of the community to many of the students and their families. The school building is a well-kept, modern building  where pride in the students' accomplishments is evident in the prominently displayed student work.   The average class size in kindergarten through third grade, following the Early Grade Class Size Reduction Program, is  twenty one (21) students. The average class size in third, fourth and fifth grades is twenty-five (25) students. Students  are heterogeneously grouped within each grade. Current strategies for implementing the Common Core Learning  Standards include using differentiated instruction and developing programs to increase movement to less restrictive  environments for Students With Disabilities (SWD).   PS 677 will take a continuous improvement, data-driven approach to improving student performance, using item  analysis, portfolio assessment, and other indicators to identify and address student weakness and target areas for  growth. Ongoing assessments will be both formal and informal. Assessments will also be used to drive instruction.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   The school houses two full day Pre-kindergarten classes, four full day kindergarten classes, four first grade, four  second grade, four third grade, four fourth grade, and four fifth grade classes in general education, five collaborative  team teaching (ICT) classes (serving grades PK-5), and three self-contained special education classes (12:1:1). There is  also a freestanding ESL program for grades K-5, which serves English Language Learners who are not in the bilingual  program.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Performance Trends:      After consistent progress monitoring using various formative assessment tools, data   analysis of summative assessments findings indicate the following:   Kindergarten :   Students that are admitted from universal pre-kindergarten programs and other early learning programs must focus  on alphabet recognition, alphabet writing and phonemic awareness.   82% of all students are at or above level D, according to Fountas and Pinnell scores, in reading.   First Grade :   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      54% of all students are at or above level F, according to Fountas and Pinnell scores, in reading.   Second Grade :   45% of all students are at or above the expected a level L according to Fountas and Pinnell scores.      Based on the analysis of the NYS Reading test the following performance trends are indicated for grades 3-5:     Third Grade :         o  35% of the students have met or exceeded the state standard of Level 3.   Fourth Grade :   o  28% of the students meet or exceed the state standard level of 3.   Fifth Grade :   o  30% of the students meet or exceed the state standard level of 3.   Greatest Success in English Language Arts:   Students that are reading below level were in correlation with students struggling with phonemic awareness and  decoding. The use of the ReadyGEN program, Fundations and RTI has allowed the teachers to hone their skills and  develop strong strategies that can be implemented and carried over to the next year for the students. Use of teacher  created unit planning calendar will aid in pacing the curriculum and allow for grade wide uniformity.      Aids and Barriers in English Language Arts:   Teachers are receiving extensive professional development to strengthen and support implementation of the  Common Core curriculum.   Intensive professional development on the following topics:     Using assessments (formal and informal) to drive instruction    Use of question and discussion techniques to deepen student engagement     Use rubrics as informal assessments    Using portfolios effectively to guide students toward meeting the standards    Using conferencing to improve student reading levels    Accountable talk/ literature circles    Comprehension and reading strategies   Based on the analysis of the Math IA the following performance trends are indicated for grades K-2:     Kindergarten:   o  65% of the students have met or exceeded the grade level expectation.   First Grade:   o  60% of the students have met or exceeded the grade level expectation.   Second Grade:   o  40% of the students have met or exceeded the grade level expectation.            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      Based on the analysis of the NYS Math test the following performance trends are indicated for grades 3-5:     Third Grade :   o  23% of the students have met or exceeded the state standard of Level 3.   Fourth Grade :   o  10% of the students meet or exceed the state standard level of 3.   Fifth Grade :   o  17 % of the students meet or exceed the state standard level of 3.            Greatest Success in Mathematics:   Continuation of instructional strategies that have contributed to overall improved student achievement, including the  continuation of a 60 minute math block.   Continuation of a school-wide math program Go Math with parallel instruction in all classes, including self-contained  and ICT.   Teachers will use Go Math unit completion and other assessments to provide instructional emphasis on students’  strengths and weaknesses to assist in the grouping of students.   Use of the inquiry model to analyze and monitor student progress.    Aids and Barriers in Mathematics:   A review of benchmark assessments and teacher observations indicates students in grades 3-5 have the following  weaknesses across the grades:     Number Sense and Operations    Geometry     Statistics and Probability   Based on our analysis of the data and all relevant findings, the following are implications for our Math instructional  program:     Continuation of a school-wide math program Go Math with parallel instruction in all classes, including self-  contained and inclusion, with ST Math as support for skills practice.     Continued provision of intensive Academic Intervention Services (AIS) to all students who are not meeting      state standards using Guided Math groups and Interactive games.  Intensive professional development in the understanding and use of specialized instructional strategies to  meet the needs of all students.

Part 4: SWP Schools Only   4a. Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).  Ongoing Communication for Staff   Invite staff of the preschool and kindergarten programs to participate in exchange visits.       Establish and implement joint in-service professional development sessions, meetings and discussions   focused on transition, curriculum and instructional practices.     Pre-Kindergarten teachers will develop a list of competencies/skills that Pre-Kindergarten children will come   away with when they complete the year and begin kindergarten. This list of competencies/ skills will be  passed on to the kindergarten teachers.   Transition Activities for Children   Schedule a visit or a series of visits to the new school for the children       Provide pre-kindergarten children with a summer package that includes transition activities    Encourage children to ask questions about kindergarten    Organize a Pre-Kindergarten Day for parents and children who will be attending Kindergarten in the public   school the following year  Involvement of Parents in Transition       Provide parents with information about the school their child will be attending     Invite school personnel, teachers and principals, to attend a parent meeting and discuss the kindergarten  program, the role of parents in the school and to answer any other questions. It is a good idea to include  family assistants or parent coordinators that can translate the information during the meeting.  Invite parents who have already had children transition to kindergarten to talk about their experience to the  parents of the incoming group.      Establish routines that children will use during the year, ex. where children will be picked up at the end of the day,  where children will eat lunch, etc.        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Measuring student learning allows educators to better understand their students’ strengths and how best to support  student growth. By collaboratively making thoughtful MOSL selections, schools can measure student growth in  meaningful ways that reinforce their instructional priorities.    A MOSL team is assembled and meets to select appropriate multiple assessments that each grade and cluster will be  held accountable. Professional development involves the following in terms of MOSL implementation:   Looking at student work and assessment results in vertical and horizontal teacher teams        Using norming exercises to plan instruction across grades or subjects     Using benchmark and formative assessments to regularly check-in throughout the year to assess student   progress        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Verify with an (X)   Column B   Section Reference(s)  Section 5 (A-E)        Section 5 (A-E)        Section 5 (A-E)      Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local   410,132.00     0   12,366.00     0   3,388,809.00      X        X        X        1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. East New York Elementary School of Excellence, in compliance with the  Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a  parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and  the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and  decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the  School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed  members of the school community.       Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   East New York Elementary School of Excellence will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional  development, and 20% to OTPS.       For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and  Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

The theater troupe will rehearse and  eventually present a musical.  This troupe will consist of ELLs and former ELLs.  This Title III  program will be open to 20 ELLs or more.  We will use the Title III funds to purchase the  showkit (scripts, director's guides, rehearsal CDs, etc), as well as materials to create costumes,  props, and sets, which our ELLs will construct.  Many of our beginning (Entering) ELLs cannot  yet communicate with others in English.  Many of them have just immigrated to the United  States and are still adjusting to their new surroundings.  They still lack BICS (Basic Interpersonal  Communicative Skills).  Our beginning ELLs, including newcomers, will perform in the theater  production.  They will have English dialogue to read, rehearse, and recite, and English lyrics to  sing.  At PS 677K, there are over 50 ELLs in 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade.  57% of those ELLs have  received ENL services for 0-3 years, 9 of which are new immigrants to the United States and  need basic communication skills.  Students will develop their English language skills through this program.  Those students in the  cast will be listening for cues, reading their scripts, writing notes in the margins, and speaking  their lines of dialogue.  Those students in set design and costume will have a hands-on  experience in these arts, and will have to follow directions, both oral and written, in order to  produce the desired product.  Please note, the supervisor on site for this program, the principal,  will not be paid through Title III funds.

Rosetta Stone K-12 can be used by the  newcomers to the United States who need to acquire BICS.  Rosetta Stone is also designed to  help more advanced ELLs to acquire academic language (CALP) and to use more complex  grammatical structures.  This computer program integrates speaking, listening, reading, and  writing for all skill levels.  The ELL Coordinator, who is a certified ENL teacher, will hold  separate orientations for teachers and parents to guide them through the program. The parent  orientation for rosetta stone will be provided by the certified ENL teachers on November 27,  2018, from 2:30-3:00pm.  Parents will be notified in their preferred language via letter.  Students will be able to continue learning when they return home by using their username and  password for the online program.  They may use the program with other family members, so that  the entire family can learn English together.  Parents of ELLs often do not speak English as well, and they will benefit from working with  their children.  Levels may be repeated in Rosetta Stone, and a parent may want to start from the  very beginning.  By learning English, parents will be modeling for their children.  Moreover,  they will be better equipped to help their children with their schoolwork.    Parents will return home with their child and will use Rosetta Stone together for a minimum of  30 minutes. Parents and their children are welcome to use the program at any other time they  wish.    In addition, throughout the year our school holds workshops for families.  Parents who do not  speak English will be able to participate because there will be specific rooms designated for their  language group.  A facilitator will work with them in their home language so that they can be  involved in their children's education.    Parents of ELLs will be invited to participate in a Title III orientation, which will introduce them  to the activities their children will partake in during the Title III after school program.  This event  will be provided by the certified ENL teachers on November 20, 2018, from 2:30- 3:00pm.  Parents will be notified in their preferred language via letter.    The parents of ELLs that are participating in the Title III after school program will be invited to a  Rosetta Stone orientation.  During this orientation, the parents will learn how to access and use  the program with their children at home.  This event will be provided by the certified ENL  teachers on November 27, 2018, from 2:30-3:00pm.  Parents will be notified in their preferred  language via letter.    Parents of ELLs will also be invited to participate in NYSESLAT Night (no Title III money must  be used for this event).  During NYSESLAT Night, parents and their children will learn more  about the test that is quickly approaching.  This event will be facilitated by the certified ENL  teachers.  This event will be provided by the certified ENL teachers on March 26, 2019, from  2:30-3:00pm.  Parents will be notified in their preferred language via letter.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49   Part E: Budget   FOR SCHOOLS NOT CONCEPTUALLY CONSOLIDATED ONLY.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Initially, we use the NYSITELL to assess reading and writing skills.  The NYSITELL provides insights about our ELLs.  We use this  tool to find their English proficiency level: Entering (beginning), Emerging (low intermediate), Transitioning (high  intermediate), Expanding (advanced), or Commanding (proficient).  We also test all incoming students using the Fountas &  Pinnell Benchmark Assessment System 1.  We assess the incoming student's phonics and word analysis, as well as their  incoming reading level.   We use the Fountas and Pinnell assessment system to assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs. The Fountas and Pinnell  assessment system also provides insights about our ELLs.  The system helps us to identify the proficiency level of our ELL  scholars in reading, writing, listening and speaking. For our newest ELL scholars, F&P gives us specific data around their ability  to identify letter sound correspondence and phonemic awareness. This helps to inform our school's instructional plan by   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      providing data points that  we use to develop our ELL and RTI plans. We use this data to help decide which scholars will receive  Tier 1 solely based on their level of proficiency and which scholars will receive Tier II or Tier III academic intervention.    In addition, an in-house created baseline assessment is administered to every ELL.  This assessment is based on the NYSESLAT,  and tests their speaking, listening, reading, and writing skills.  For the kindergarten students, newcomers, and incoming  transfers, this assessment gives us specific data about their ability to identify letters and sounds, their ability to write letters,  and their ability to read sight words.   Before each ENL unit of study, the students are given a pretest.  This test is then retaken by the students after they have  learned the material.  This informs the ENL teachers of whether or not the students have mastered the material, and whether  or not the material must be retaught.        2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   At the beginning of the school year, the two ENL teachers evenly split the responsibility of testing each prospective incoming  English language learner.  When the student is brought to a separate location, the student is administered the NYSITELL and  the in-house baseline assessment that is designed for newcomers.  All transfers are also given this in-house baseline exam,  regardless of proficiency level.  After NYSITELL testing is completed, the ENL teachers administer the in-house baseline  assessment that is designed for continuing students.  These continuing students are brought to a separate location in groups of  8 or fewer.  F&P is administered by classroom teachers and the data is reported to the ENL teachers.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We administer in-house interim/periodic assessments to our newcomers and Entering/Emerging students in order to evaluate  the progress of our ELLs throughout the year.  We administer the CCSS-aligned NYC ELL Periodic Assessment mid-year to  evaluate the speaking, listening, reading, and writing progress of our continuing Transitioning/Expanding students.  The  ELA coach also administers CCSS-aligned reading and writing interim assessments to the entire student body throughout the  year.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once the NYC ELL Periodic Assessment is administered and scored, the ENL teachers access the pre-formatted reports on  NYC Schoolnet which break down each question and the standard that they are aligned with.  The standards that gave the  students the most difficulty will be taught/retaught.  The data accumulated from the in-house baseline for newcomers will also  inform our instruction.  It is an inventory of letters, sounds, and sight words.  This assessment will let us know which letters,  sounds, and sight words must be taught/retaught to each group of ELLs.  The ELA interim assessments are also aligned with  the CCSS, and the results are evaluated as well to find which standards each grade must concentrate on as a whole.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Our school uses this data to guide instruction for our ELLs.  We group the ELLs according to our NYSITELL and NYSESLAT  data.  The students in Tier 1, our Expanding and Transitioning ELLs, only receive integrated ENL four periods per week.  Our  Tier 2, continuing Emerging ELLs, receive a combination of integrated and stand-alone ENL, for extra attention in a small group  setting.  Our Tier 3 students in ENL, the Entering-level newcomers to the country, receive a combination of integrated and  stand-alone ENL designed to meet their specific needs.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   We can measure the success of our ENL program by looking at our NYSESLAT scores.  Last September (2015), approximately  50% of our ELL students who received services via freestanding ENL were in the beginning levels of ENL: Entering and  Emerging.  They took the NYSESLAT in April and May 2016.  After the 2016 NYSESLAT exam results were released, only  approximately 25% of our ELLs were in the beginning levels of ENL.  The other 75% were Transitioning (High Intermediate),  Expanding (Advanced), or Commanding (Proficient). Two of our students tested out of ENL.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         The 2016 NYSESLAT results reveal that almost 50% percent (29 out of 64) of the continuing ELL students who received services  via freestanding ENL in the 2015-2016 school year scored at least one proficiency level higher than the previous year (at least  one or two levels higher than their NYSITELL score from 2015-2016 or their Spring 2015 NYSESLAT score), including two  students who scored Commanding (proficient).            7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   At the beginning of the school year, the ELL Coordinator informs each classroom teacher of which students in their class are  ELLs, and each student's English proficiency level.  The ELL Coordinator also distributes a booklet of strategies that the  classroom teachers can use with their ELLs. The ELL Coordinator writes a monthly email to the staff, updating them about the  progress of our ELLs, and giving the teachers a specific focus for that month, which is chosen based on the findings of our  assessments.  In addition, the ENL teachers hold monthly professional development sessions with the staff to both disseminate  information about the students, and to provide them with helpful skills and strategies.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Our integrated ENL classes are heterogeneous.  On each grade level, for 180 minutes per week, an ENL teacher  pushes into one classroom with all of the ELLs in that grade.  The ENL teacher and the classroom teacher coteach  using various models: parallel teaching, team teaching, etc.  Our stand-alone ENL classes are homogeneous; these  groups consist of only Entering and Emerging students.  These students are pulled out of their classrooms and brought  to a separate location in small groups (under 10). The stand-alone groups are arranged according to the NYSESLAT  bands: there is a kindergarten group, a 1st   and 2nd   grade group, a 3rd   and 4th   grade group, and a 5th   grade  group.  The time allotment is based on the regulations of the CR Part 154. The instruction is aligned with the Common Core  State Standards. The ENL teacher collaborates with classroom teachers about curriculum and students' abilities,  needs, and accomplishments.  Once a week, the ENL teacher meets with each co-teacher individually to plan for the  following week.       b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Entering and Emerging students receive at least 180 minutes of integrated ENL instruction per week, and at least 180 minutes  of standalone ENL instruction per week.  Transitioning students receive at least 180 minutes of integrated ENL instruction per  week, or 90 minutes of integrated ENL and 90 minutes of stand-alone ENL per week.  Expanding students receive at least 180  minutes of integrated ENL per week.  Commanding students receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL per week.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Each ENL class uses content to drive language instruction.  The SIOP model is used to deliver instruction in the integrated ENL  classes, and ELA is used to drive instruction in the stand-alone ENL classes.  ENL instruction includes, but is not limited to, the use of pictures, videos, manipulatives, gestures, role-playing, chants, and  songs to make content comprehensible, and to foster language development.  The ENL teacher provides content area support  for all ELLs during the integrated ENL classes. Certain teachers are bilingual and can use the students’ native language to make  content comprehensible.  In every classroom, every ELL is paired up with a bilingual, English-proficient peer who can help  direct them and clarify instruction.  We have bilingual Spanish, Haitian Creole, French, Bengali, and Arabic language books in  our classroom libraries for our ELLs.  All ELLs are held to the same CCSS.  Any assignments are scaffolded appropriately for each  ELL.  Class trips provide the ENL teacher opportunities for discussion, language experience approach, and reinforcement of  topics being taught in the classroom.  Students in grades three through five have been provided with the NYS Bilingual  Glossaries for mathematics, social studies, and science to aid them throughout the year and on their state exams.  ELLs receive  testing modifications which include, but are not limited to, testing in a separate location, the use of bilingual glossaries, and  the simultaneous use of English and Alternative Language Editions on state assessments (except ELA).     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   We administer the Spanish LAB to Spanish-speaking ELLs at the beginning of the year.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a. SIFE students will receive AIS services in both reading and math.  They will receive age and grade appropriate instruction  that is scaffolded to make the content comprehensible.     b. Students that have been in U.S. schools less than two years receive constant exposure to vocabulary and literacy instruction  using a variety of manipulatives, gestures, videos, and pictures.  We want our newcomers to make a smooth assimilation and  to start communicating.  The students who have just arrived to the United States receive alternative homework assignments  designed to improve their BICS and build their Tier I vocabulary.  These newcomers are paired with bilingual English-proficient  students in their classroom who guide them through the lesson.  If they can write in their native language, they may use their  L1 to write and answer questions, and eventually integrate their L2, which is English.        c. ENL students who have been receiving services three to six years are taught reading skills and strategies to help them  comprehend what they are reading, master the common core learning standards, and ultimately achieve grade level or above  grade level scores on the NYS ELA exam. Lesson plans are modified and differentiated for these students to ensure they can  fully engage in the lesson and learn the objective that is being taught.     d. Long-term ELLs will be taught reading skills and strategies to help them comprehend what they are reading, master the  common core learning standards, and ultimately achieve grade level or above grade level scores on the NYS ELA exam. Lesson  plans will be modified and differentiated for these students to ensure they can fully engage in the lesson and learn the  objective that is being taught.  These students will also receive AIS services to supplement their ELA and math lessons.     e. Former ELLs continue to receive two 45 minute periods of ENL per week for one year.  Former ELLs are also eligible for ELL  testing accomodations, such as time and a half on exams, for up to two years.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Teachers who service ELL-SWDs have access to their IEPs.  The ELL-SWDs receive all services mandated on their IEPs.  If an ELL- SWD has an IEP which mandates ENL instruction, they are serviced by the ENL teacher accordingly.  If an ELL-SWD's IEP  mandates bilingual instruction, we will inform the parent that we do not have a TBE program at the present time and offer to  request an alternate paraprofessional who can provide native language support.    Every classroom has a leveled library, as well as a section for books in languages other than English.  Teachers of ELL-SWD use a  variety of supports to make content comprehensible, such as, but not limited to, scaffolding, wait time, visuals (pictures,  videos, etc.), modeling, gestures, small groups, and kinesthetic activities.  Content is on grade-level and meets the needs of the  CCLS, but is scaffolded to make content comprehensible.  The strategies teachers employ include, but are not limited to role-playing and components of a Balanced Literacy program.  This includes shared reading, shared writing, interactive writing, guided and independent reading, and read alouds. We use  graphic organizers and coopeartive learning, which provides ELLs with an opporutnity to engage in accountable talk.  Furthermore, ENL instruction utilizes pictures, games, dramatization, text representations, and manipulatives, chants, songs,  poems and charts to help them acquire language skills.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  The ENL teachers meet with the IEP team and the Special Education teachers to discuss how we can target each child's  individual needs.  Our school ensures that flexible programming is used to maximize time spent with non-disabled  peers.  Those students in a 12:1:1 class only receive instruction in a standalone small group setting.  Some ELLs are in ICT  classes and are with non-disabled peers all day.  The school psychologist conducts a number of tests to determine where the  child falls on the spectrum.    Depending on what type of disabilities the child has and how serious those disabilities are, the  child is placed either in general ed, ICT, or 12:1:1.  Based on the findings, the school psychologist writes the IEP that is decided  upon, and the child is placed in the appropriate setting. A bilingual school psychologist may be assigned in order to produce  the most accurate results.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  AIS is offered to ELLs who are reading below grade level or need intervention.  In AIS, students work in a small group (not  larger than 4:1) on phonics, phonemic awareness, sight words, and comprehension skills.  Speech is also offered in our  school.  Speech/language therapy may be recommended for a student with a communication problem, including problems of  language comprehension and expressive language which adversely affect school performance.  During the literacy block in  every class, the teacher facilitates small guided reading groups.  We provide math AIS with our math coach, if  needed.  Students would be pulled out in small groups to work on math basics and anything grade- appropriate that needs to  be addressed.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      We started using the SIOP model last year, which has proved to be very useful in the integrated setting.  In the stand-alone  setting, we have been using Language Power by Teacher Created Materials.  To improve this program, we have supplemented  it with visuals and targeted, more specific grammar instruction.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A.  Currently, no programs/services will be discontinued.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are included in all school activities.  All notifications are translated into multiple languages, and an interpreter is available  for all parent meetings.  The theater program is open to all third through fifth grade students, and is specifically designed for  our ELLs.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      Our ELLs are invited to all school events. We ensure that all school correspondence is distributed in English as well as the home  languages of our families. We would like to extend to our scholars the opportunity to participate in any afterschool club of  their choice.       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Grammar software for the SmartBoard is used in classes.  Manipulatives are used in math and science classes.  Videos are used  in all content areas.  The literacy program Language Power is used with ELLs in stand-alone classes.  Most of our classrooms  have SmartBoards.  Our educators use their SmartBoards to enhance the learning experience of ELLs. Words, pictures, and  videos are displayed to help ELLs understand the academic language that is being used to teach the lesson. Educators also  display charts and sentence strips to clarify and facilitate learning.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Certain teachers are able bilingual and can use the students’ native language to clarify directions, instructions, and content.  In  every classroom, every ELL is paired up with a bilingual, English-proficient peer who can help direct them and clarify  instruction.  We have bilingual Spanish, Bengali, Haitian Creole, French, and Arabic language books in our classroom libraries  for our ELLs.  All ELLs are held to the same CCSS.  Any assigments are scaffolded appropriately for each ELL.  Students in grades  three through five have been provided with the NYS Bilingual Glossaries for mathematics, social studies, and science to aid  them throughout the year and on their state exams.  Our ELLs are also provided with word-to-word translation dictionaries for  use during the year and on exams.  ELLs receive testing modifications which include the simultaneous use of English and  Alternative Language Editions on state assessments (except ELA).  If an Alternative Language Edition is unavailable, we hire  interpreters.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Currently all required services support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels in our school.  All resources used to teach  our ELLs are common core aligned and age and grade-appropriate, yet leveled for our various English proficiency levels.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    The auditorium would be the only shared resource we might need to coordinate in our building.  Our Title III program is  entitled ENL Through Theater Production.  We rehearse in the auditorium once a week after school.  We need to coordinate  the use of this space with two other schools.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   We invite all families to our family orientation. This orientation serves as an opportunity for families to engage with key  members of our school community (classroom and out-of-classroom teachers, administrators, PTA members, etc.), to present  relevant information about our school policy’s, mission, vision, curriculum, and discipline code.  Throughout the year, if an ELL  is enrolled, the family is invited to a parent orientation to discuss their program options, as well as to answer any questions  they may have.  An interpreter is provided for all meetings.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?   Currently, we do not offer language electives.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57         d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The ENL certified teachers will attend professional development seminars throughout the year and turnkey them to all  teachers of ELLs.    The ENL teachers have attended several different professional development sessions, including but not limited to sessions  about co-teaching (integrated ENL), improving ELL achievement through CCSS-aligned instruction, close reading, meaningful  conversations, text-dependent questions, literacy, keeping up with compliance, and how to administer the NYSESLAT.  Most of  these PDs teach us strategies for delivering high quality instruction that is aligned with the CCSS.  Some sessions work on high  quality oral language, some sessions work on delivering high quality vocabulary instruction, and others target writing issues, all  aligned with the CCSS.     The certified ENL teachers will attend PD sessions throughout the year.  In the 2017-2018 school year, the certified ENL  teachers will sign up to attend PD sessions offered by the DELLSS.  The certified ENL teachers will then turn-key the  information to their non-ENL certified, common branch licensed colleagues in monthly meetings on Monday's throughout the  year.  These meetings will be conducted to not only coach non-ENL certified educators in ENL strategies, but to also make the  staff updated and aware of all ELL regulations, modifications, and differentiations.      Meetings will take place:  September 2017, with all staff, topic: Language Allocation Policy, facilitators: the certified ENL teachers  September 2017, with classroom educators of ELLs, topic: how to use the NYSESLAT scores to inform your lessons and  differentiate for ELLs, facilitators: the certified ENL teachers  October 2017, with classroom educators of ELLs, topic: facilitating English conversations between beginning ELLs, facilitators:  the certified ENL teachers  October 2017, with all staff, topic: EDAT (ELL Data Analysis Tool), facilitators: the certified ENL teachers  November 2017, with classroom educators of ELLs, topic: breaking down math word problems for ELLs, facilitators: the  certified ENL teachers  January 2017, with classroom educators of ELLs, topic: differentiating for different learning styles/modalities (visuals, gestures,  color coating, manipulatives), facilitators: the certified ENL teachers  January 2017, with classroom educators of ELLs, topic: the NYSESLAT and how classroom teachers can prepare their students  for it / skills that will be tested, facilitators: the certified ENL teachers  February 2017, with classroom educators of ELLs, topic: front-loading and teaching vocabulary, facilitators: the certified ENL  teachers  March 2017, with classroom educators of ELLs, topic: count/noncount nouns, facilitators: the certified ENL teachers  March 2017, with all staff, topic: testing strategies for ELLs / using bilingual dictionaries/glossaries, facilitator: the certified ENL  teachers  April 2017, with all staff, topic: NYSESLAT schedule and format, facilitators: the certified ENL teachers  May 2017, with classroom educators of ELLs, topic: subject-verb agreement, facilitators: the certified ENL teachers  June 2017, with classroom educators of ELLs, topic: reflection, facilitator: the certified ENL teachers     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         There is a continuous conversation between the ENL teachers and the rest of the staff.  Data is shared between classroom  teachers and the ENL teachers.  The ENL teachers introduce strategies and techniques to the rest of the staff on a regular  basis.  The ELL Coordinator researches schools alongside students in 5th grade who are preparing to transition to middle  school.  The ELL Coordinator contacts prospective schools on behalf of the 5th grade ELLs to find out the services and programs  provided that will help them to maintain and excel in English language proficiency, ELA, Math, and all other content areas.  The  ELL Coordinator will share this information with the school's guidance counselor.  The ELL Coordinator will partner with the  school's guidance counselor during senior meetings to reach out and connect with ELL families and to answer questions they  may have.  We work closely with our families to help them choose a school that best fits the needs of their child who receives ELL services.  We provide our families with information about specific schools that have a strong, successful ELL program. We send letters  home in both English and their home language to inform families about Middle School Choice Fairs at these schools as well.   At least fifty percent of the total professional development hours ENL teachers receive is ELL-specific.  The ENL teachers  provide ELL training for the staff, turnkeying best instructional practices they have learned at various professional  development sessons. PD sessions provided include, but are not limited to, Word Tiers, Linear Arrays (teaching vocabulary),  Differentiating Instruction, and Demystifying Figurative Language.  These priorities will help us meet the instructional needs of  our ELL population.   The goal is always to provide our educators with strategies they can walk away with and implement by  the session's end.  Attendance sheets and agendas for each PD are placed in the ENL Records Binder.  The hours are recorded  on a cover sheet and kept in the Records Binder.         Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   In addition to PS 677K's family orientation, parent-teacher conferences, and the ELL parent orientation, the ENL teachers also  meet with parents individually to discuss the goals of the program, language development progress, language proficiency  assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas.  Interpreters are present to assist in these  meetings.  All notifications sent home are translated into multiple home languages.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   When the school has an assembly for parents, there are interpreters present to assist our parents.  ELL parents are sent  notifications in their home language, so that they understand everything that is happening at their child's school.  This year,  our parents attended our Back to School night at which they met their child's teacher and learned about the curriculum.  In  years past, we have held Math Game sessions involving our parents, and Breaking Down the Levels, to help our parents  become more active in their child's education.  Parents are sent alternative homework assignments to work on with their  child.  The directions for these assignments are translated into their home language.             Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Janet Huger, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   East NY Elem.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      ELLs make up over 17% of our population, but the percentage of students with a home language other than  English is larger: 25%. During the administration of the HLIS, a trained pedagogue interviews the  parents/guardians of the child being enrolled. At that time, the pedagogue notes the language needs of the  family. At the bottom of the page of the HLIS, in Part III, the parents/guardians are asked which language they  would prefer to communicate in.    A language survey is also filled out by parents when their child is enrolled. The parents choose which language  they want the school to communicate with them in (written and oral communication). Notices, progress reports,  report cards, and other correspondence is sent home in the child's home language as well as English.   According to the RHLA on ATS, East New York Elementary School of Excellence has:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63      15 Bengali speaking students    16 Arabic speaking students    101 Spanish speaking students    2 Fulani speaking students    2 Haitian Creole speaking students    According to the RCPL report on ATS, there are many families who wish to receive communication in their home  language. This data can be found in the table below.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     Language    Written Preferred    Percent Written    Oral Preferred    Percent Oral    English   Spanish   Bengali   Arabic           467   104   16   11   77.7   17.3   2.66   1.83   464   106   17   11   77.2   17.64   2.83   1.83   3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu).

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      In the case of an immediate emergency, the school uses school messenger to reach all families. This is usually in  English, but in-house interpreters can tag on messages in Spanish, Arabic, Haitian Creole, and Bengali. If the message  can be delivered via a written notice, in-house personnel can translate the document into Spanish, Arabic, Haitian  Creole, and Bengali.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65       Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      Staff members will be made aware of the resources that are available to them through meetings with the LAC at the  beginning of the school year. They will be provided with the phone number for interpretation services and will be  given instructions for submitting a translation request.          Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      When a parent enters the building, they will be welcomed by our Welcome Poster. The safety agents have a language  ID guide in order to determine which interpreter should assist them. Every parent will receive a Parents' Bill of Rights  and a Parents' Guide to Language Access brochure.   Section VII of Chancellor's Regulations A-663 and how we provide these services:   A. Schools and offices are responsible for providing each parent whose primary language is a   covered language and who require language assistance services with a copy of the   Bill of Parent Rights and Responsibilities which includes their rights regarding   translation and interpretation services. Translated versions of this document,   in the covered languages, are available at   http://schools.nyc.gov/RulesPolicies/ParentBillofRights/default.htm   These documents are distributed in English, Spanish, Bengali, Haitian Creole, and Arabic at the parent orientation held  at the beginning of the school year.   B. Schools and offices must post in a conspicuous location at or near the primary entrance to   such school a sign in each of the covered languages, or most prominent   covered languages, indicating the availability of interpretation services.   Translated signs, in the covered languages, are available at   http://schools.nyc.gov/Offices/Translation/TipsandResources/Default.htm .   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66      This sign is posted near the primary entrance to ENYESE in the most prominent covered languages.   C. Each school’s safety plan will contain procedures for ensuring that parents in need of   language access services are not prevented from reaching the school’s administrative   offices solely due to language barriers.   This is a part of our safety plan. All parents have equal access to all information and administrative offices, regardless  of language.   D. Each school at which the parents of more than 10% of the children at such school speak a   primary language that is neither English nor a covered language, shall obtain from the   Translation and Interpretation Unit a translation into such language of the signage and   forms required pursuant to this section and shall post and provide such forms in accordance   with this section.   We do not have over 10% of non-English speakers of a language that is not covered at the present time, but when we  do, we will carry out this requirement.   E. The Department’s website shall provide information in each of the covered languages   concerning the rights of parents to translation and interpretation services and how to access   such services.         Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       Bi-annually we will send out a parent survey to get feedback from parents on the quality of our translation and  interpretation services. Informally, we will ask parents their thoughts, and we will take note of what we did well, and  what we need to do to in order to improve our translation and interpretation services for families.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67
