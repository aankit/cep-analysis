The motivation driving this work is our commitment to providing every child with a school that  meets their academic and social-emotional needs. Closely accompanying this imperative is our belief that every school  can be renewed and foster a community based culture of learning. The job of the district is to use our position to  provide the systemic vision, strategies, and resources to facilitate school renewal through a collaborative effort including  all stakeholders.     The core values held as essential for the success of the School Renewal Program:     A “learning stance” must be held by all community members (district leaders, school leaders, school staff,   community-based partners, students and families). The work should be approached with humility and integrity.  We must all be willing learners.     A “theory of action” must guide the work to ensure clarity and coherence.    Authentic teams that collaborate in the spirit of trust, within and across the various levels of the school   community, are prerequisites for successful school renewal     Schools will be places of robust engagement, anchored in positive youth development, ensuring that the school   environment is welcoming and empowering for students, families and community members.     Strong professional development/learning is a fundamental part of our work.    The school renewal implementation must be simultaneously dynamic and responsive as well as sustained over   the three year period of renewal.     The organizing Theory of Action that guides the School Renewal Program strategy:   By using the Six Elements of the Framework for Great schools as our improvement structure, we seek to align  instructional coaching and leadership development with structural supports in order to build staff capacity.   Using schools  instructional foci, school leaders  and staff will implement changes  in curriculum,  instruction,  school  culture  and  structures  so  that  there  are  sustainable  improvements  in  student  outcomes  and  school  culture.     The arc of the School Renewal Program strategy:  In order to attain high levels of achievement for all students in Renewal  schools we must build capacity to increase  student achievement through the adoption of new attitudes and behaviors, research based strategies that improve  teacher practice, coupled with the use of clear data driven supports for building students’ skills in the content areas and  increasing student engagement. We are particularly prioritizing reading and writing across the curricula.  The use of  student learning data will drive instruction through strong teacher teams; onsite, job embedded professional learning  and problem solving, and accountability at all levels of the system:  central, district and school - for results. Renewal  schools are provided with intensive training, leadership and pedagogical coaching, and structural supports, monitoring  of implementation and ongoing feedback and revisions as needed. Further, each Renewal school will become a  Community School and strategically partner with community based organizations (CBO) to integrate social services and  expanded learning time into the fabric of the school to help them better serve the needs of students.  These schools will  stand as centers of opportunities where families can get the supports they need to make sure students come to school  ready and able to learn.    School Receivership    In April 2015, state lawmakers and Governor Andrew Cuomo created section 211-f of the State Education Law, which  established the School Receivership program as a new intervention strategy to turn around struggling schools. This new  law, and Commissioner’s regulation 100.19, requires that “Persistently Struggling Schools,” defined as Priority Schools  that have been in the most severe accountability status since the 2006-07 school year, be given an initial one or two- year period under a “Superintendent Receiver”.  These schools were placed in receivership under the New York City  Schools Chancellor. Each school must make demonstrable improvement on specific benchmarks or it will be placed  under an independent receiver. Under the Chancellor’s Receivership Plan, the School Renewal Program is NYCDOE’s   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      5     core strategy for turning around struggling schools. Renewal Schools have already begun implementing significant  interventions and are receiving additional resources and support to accelerate student performance and help close  achievement gaps reflected in this RSCEP.    Structure of the Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP)   The Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP) will serve as the organizing and overarching document for  each Renewal school and will be directly aligned and developed around the elements of the Framework for Great  Schools, New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, and Strong Schools,  Strong Communities, including the following:     Demonstrable Improvement Benchmarks: Demonstrable improvement benchmarks located in the 2018-19   RSCEP, in the Data and Accountability Snapshot page.  Receivership benchmarks have been closely aligned with  the Renewal benchmarks so that schools will have one coherent set of improvement benchmarks to meet.  All  Receivership Benchmarks are a subset of Renewal Benchmarks. While the targets for these overlapping  benchmarks are not always identical, the Receivership Benchmark targets are always equal to or lower that the  Renewal Benchmarks targets. That means that any school that meets its Renewal Benchmarks targets have by  definition also met its Receivership Benchmarks targets. For additional information on Receivership  demonstrable improvement benchmarks go here.      Establishing an overarching summative vision aligned with elements of the Framework for Great Schools and   documenting key areas of celebration and renewal through analysis of assessments and by envisioning what the  desired outcome for each school will be at the end of the School Renewal process.      Setting interim assessment benchmarks that create the path for improvement by focusing on desired outcomes   and goals. In this way, the plan will be mapped to the overarching summative vision. In addition to the five  discrete goals formed around the elements of the Framework for Great Schools, each school will create an  action plan.     Transformation into a community school in order to increase student and family access to physical and mental   health services and other social-emotional supports made available in or near the school.     Expanded learning opportunities for all students, including additional instruction provided during afterschool      and/or summer programming provided in collaboration with community partners.  Intensive professional development for all staff to ensure effective implementation of curriculum and  instruction aligned to the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and to support staff in effectively responding  to the differentiated academic and social-emotional needs of all students.    Additional, focused strategies to increase parent and family engagement.      Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Information on the Framework for Great Schools and the DTSDE   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      6     The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and RSCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive  Educational Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for  continuous improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing  review and analysis of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement  activities and strategies that improve outcomes for students.       Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.       The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      7     School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:   1.  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity  2.  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions  3.  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support  4.  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions  5.  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and  6.  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement    NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   I.  Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:         It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the RSCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the RSCEP.

Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Create a summative vision for the elements of the Framework for Great Schools.     Step 5: Revisit your school’s current goals, and strategically create new goals informed by the needs   assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART – Specific,  Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you monitor  progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you have identified, and will let your school  community know when you have reached your goal.       Step 6: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 7: Update your school’s AIS section. Title I schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement   Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 8: Complete the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) and the Community School sections.     Step 9: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether strategies and activities outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust practices along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      9      Section 3: Community Engagement Team and School Leadership Team (SLT) Signature Page      Directions: All SLT members are expected to sign this page to confirm their participation in the development of this  Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP).

Summarize the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) opportunities that have been offered to your students this year.   Flushing High School believes that a student-centered inquiry based approach to learning provides students with an  opportunity to engage in rigorous tasks while engaging in a standards aligned course of study across all subject areas.  Flushing High School's mission is to build within its students the academic and social and emotional skills required to  be college and career ready including engaging in collaborative work with peers, building personal integrity and the  confidence to champion social justice. Within our vision, our community is committed to striving for academic  excellence while providing a wide range of academic as well as social and emotional supports, and instilling a sense of  pride in the work and progress of Flushing High School.     Our student-centered teaching and learning community at Flushing High School is committed to supporting our  students in achieving academic success through our school’s Grade Level Support Teams (4 Teams), Peer Group  Connection program, student leadership program, and strong social-emotional supports that are all founded in our  core value of unconditional positive regard for all students. An integral part of Flushing High School will be the  extended learning time integrated into the school day which will provide students with the opportunity to work  with teachers in a supportive setting on their literacy and numeracy skills across all subject areas. Students will also be  provided with opportunities to engage in academic as well as social-emotional enrichment both within extended  learning time as well as in our after school and Saturday Boot-camps/ Rock the Regents Saturdays.     All stakeholders of our learning community believe that a critical aspect to school improvement, specifically in the  area of student outcomes, resides in giving students voice in their own learning and a sense of voice as they form  their opinions as global citizens. Our partnership with Center for Supportive Schools, a Community Based  Organization, has helped our students to develop a more refined understanding of what it means be  emotionally intelligent and active citizens. The creation of a robust student leadership program will serve as the  foundation and model for all our leadership groups, which will serve a large percentage of our students via student  senate structures, town halls, and a variety of student led forums at our school.     Flushing High School seeks to provide a warm environment for all members of our teaching and learning community,  including families and extended members of our community at large. Families at Flushing High School will have  multiple opportunities to engage with the greater community to address challenges, support successful student  outcomes, celebrate and showcase learning and intellectual growth.

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious  intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. (Aligned to DTSDE Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support)    Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Part 1a.  Alignment to DTSDE Statements of Practice  Tenet 3 Statement of Practice   Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the  appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan.  3.2   The school leader ensures and supports the quality implementation of a systematic plan of  rigorous and coherent curricula appropriately aligned to the Common Core Learning  Standards (CCLS) that is monitored and adapted to meet the needs of students.  Teachers develop and ensure that unit and lesson plans used include data-driven instruction  (DDI) protocols that are appropriately aligned to the CCLS and NYS content standards and  address student achievement needs.  The school leader and teachers have developed a comprehensive plan for teachers to partner  within and across all grades and subjects to create interdisciplinary curricula targeting the  arts, technology, and other enrichment opportunities.  Teachers implement a comprehensive system for using formative and summative  assessments for strategic short and long-range curriculum planning that involves student  reflection, tracking of, and ownership of learning.   3.3   3.4   3.5   SOP(s)   Addressed   x   x   x               Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus:   1.  Summarize your school’s strengths relative to this element of the Framework for Great Schools and the SOPs   selected above.   2.  Summarize your school’s needs relative to this element of the Framework for Great Schools and the SOPs   selected above.  Identify the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this section.   3.  4.  What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide,   Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review?   Strengths  All teachers are using Common Core curricula across all major content areas; using Engage New York for Math, and  Collections for English and New Visions for Science and Social Studies. All curricula provide a rigorous, appropriately  aligned academic content for our students. In addition, we will use a Data Wise Inquiry model and technology, such as  New Vision Data Portal and Skedula to assist us in assessment and monitoring to assist in preparing students to take  regents examinations.     Teachers have adopted a suggested common lesson planning template to address the need for a standards aligned,  rigorous task and student work product driven classroom. The suggested common template asks teacher to articulate  their plans in specific areas, such as curricular adaptations, tasks, and grouping. Teachers are also asked in the lesson  plan template to address formative and summative assessments and strategies to provide students with access to the  task.     Needs:  Teachers and school leadership need to continue to implement a plan for an interdisciplinary four year literacy plan that  incorporates real-world connections and social justice. In addition, a systematic framework for formative and  summative assessment is needed that includes student reflection, and tracking of and ownership of learning.   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      16        The data collected in classroom observations, lesson plans, and during content team meetings show a lack of summative  and formative assessment in planning and absence of using student level assessment data to inform instruction. In  addition, data collected in classroom observations shows that teachers are not effectively co-planning with Instructional  Support Services and English as a New Language partners, modifying tasks for multiple entry points and engaging all  students in successful outcomes. Lastly, students are still not yet being provided the scaffolds to be fully reflective about  their work and are not being given the opportunities to revise their work to achieve mastery and ownership of learning.   Priorities:  To address these needs we will prioritize implementing a vertically aligned, Common Core based curricula including  Engage NY Math, Collections for English Language Arts, New Visions in Social Studies, Living Environment and Earth  Science, adapted by teachers during common planning time to meet the needs of all students. School leadership will  also create a formative assessment framework that will be unpacked in lesson planning, professional learning sessions,  and referenced in formal and informal observations. Professional learning sessions will be held as one group for 80  minutes on Monday afternoons in departments.              Part 2 – Summative Vision for Rigorous Instruction   What is your school’s instructional focus? What is your vision for promoting the instructional focus consistently across  classrooms?    Flushing High School will be a student-centered school community built around high expectations for excellence in  academics and instruction, social and emotional supports, and pride in progress. Students will be provided a rich and  robust menu of courses, including Advanced Placement and elective course, to meet graduation requirements and  ensure career and college readiness.     Instructional Focus:   If teachers plan and adapt standards-based daily lessons with formative assessment informed rigorous tasks and  differentiation, then students will produce literacy focused work products that will prepare them for college and  careers.       Vision for Meeting Instructional Focus:   The English and Math departments will implement the Curricula and Engage NY Math respectively, while the Social  Studies and Science departments will implement the respective New Visions curricula. In addition, most incoming  freshman will follow a math sequence of Algebra, Geometry and Algebra 2 and science sequence of Living Environment,  Earth Science, Chemistry, and Physics. Teachers and school leadership engage in decision making centering on creating  student “habits of mind”; curricular adaptations, and rigorous tasks across grades and departments to ensure  alignment. Additionally, Flushing’s Career and Technical Education programs in Business and Marketing are anchored by  the NYSED approved Career and Technical Education curricula and will be integrated with student habits of mind.     Teachers will regularly collaborate in both grade-level support and department-content teams. Teachers will participate  professional learning teams, common planning and family engagement, and Regents inquiry. Professional learning is  guided by the our Professional Learning Plan with a focus on support around teacher planning, curriculum adaptation,   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      17      rigorous tasks, formative assessment, and student habits of mind. During common planning sessions teachers will  unpack and adapt curricula to meet the needs of their students. In addition, teachers will plan to align daily classroom  tasks to the skills in our 4-Year Literacy Plan with the goal of students writing high-quality, extended written pieces to  performance task responses. All teachers will regularly engage in protocols, in grade teams and/or department teams,  to strategically plan and implement pedagogical strategies that support our vision of excellence, supports, and pride.  The overarching belief at our school is that students learn best when they are convinced to strive for excellence,  provided appropriate supports and guidance, and instilled with a sense of pride in their school and community.  Instructional practices will be student-centered with many opportunities for group and collaborative work. Instructional  practice will be anchored in research based protocols, driven in part, by inquiry, and supported by our Instructional  Field Guide. The expectation is that specific practices will be clearly seen in all classrooms and all subject areas. Those  practices include, but are not limited to:      ➢ Learning objectives that are written in student facing language and align directly to the “Aim” of the lesson.   ➢ Clear alignment between standards, Aim, learning target, task(s), and student work products   ➢ Flushing High School Literacy Plan skills apparent into all classrooms, such as using evidence to support a claim.   ➢ Classes will be print rich: literature to support the essential ideas being taught will be provided to supplement   the curriculum, interactive word-walls will support retention of academic vocabulary, student work will be   displayed and celebrated with actionable and meaningful feedback.   ➢ Avoidance of students passively receiving information(notes, copying, transferring information)   ➢ Teachers will use a student-centered approach to instruction that provides students with opportunities to   interact directly with the content and skills, asking questions, and participating in complex communication like   Socratic Seminars   ➢ Teachers create classroom learning environments where all students are engaged, challenged and feel safe to   take intellectual risks, and with the supports in place to provide for mastery learning, revision, and   differentiation   ➢ Teachers will be encouraged and provided resources/feedback to conduct least 3 checks for understanding and  formative assessments per lesson to inform and modify their instruction and provide consistent and timely feedback   ➢ Teachers scaffold and differentiate the “process and products” in units to allow all students to achieve   successful outcomes         What is your vision for the implementation of CCLS-aligned curricula that meets the needs of your diverse learners,  personally, academically, and culturally?    2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      18      The English and Math departments will implement the Curricula and EngageNY Math respectively, while the Social  Studies and Science departments will implement the respective New Visions curricula. In addition, incoming freshman  will follow a math (CC Algebra, Geometry, Algebra 2 and Calculus/AP Calculus) and science sequence (Living  Environment, Earth Science, Chemistry, and Physics). Teachers and school leadership engage in decision making  centering on creating student  “habits of mind”, curricular adaptations, and rigorous tasks across grades and departments to ensure alignment.  Additionally, our career and technical education programs in Business and Marketing are anchored by the NYSED  approved curricula and will be integrated with student habits of mind.         What is your vision for diverse program offerings that allow students to develop skills, habits, and behaviors to be  career and college ready? How are instructional shifts embedded in this vision?  Students' programming will be responsive to student need and student outcome data cycles. All students will be  engaged in an extended learning day consisting of 9 periods. The teachers will be on two different start times though  the students will not be. Programming will be driven by the overarching belief that students learn best when they are  motivated, encouraged and expected to strive for excellence, provided appropriate supports and guidance, and  motivated and encouraged to have a sense of pride in their school and community. Programming will reflect the  school’s vision for student-centeredness.         What do you envision the delivery of instruction to look like so that all students are set up for success?   Instructional practices will be student-centered with many opportunities for group and collaborative work. Instructional  practice will be anchored in research based protocols driven, in part, by inquiry and supported by the FHS Instructional  Field Guide. The expectation is that specific practices will be clearly seen in all classrooms and across all subject areas.     ➢ Students will be active learners.  ➢ Teachers will use a student-centered approach to instruction that provides students with opportunities to  interact directly with the content and skills, ask questions, and participate in complex communication like  Socratic Seminars to build knowledge through discourse and analysis.  ➢ Teachers create classroom learning environments where all students are engaged, challenged and feel safe to  take intellectual risks, and with the supports in place to provide for mastery learning, revision, and  differentiation.         How do you envision teachers using multiple entry points to ensure the success of every child?  ➢ Teachers will be encouraged and provided resources/feedback to conduct least 3 checks for understanding and  formative assessments per lesson to inform and modify their instruction and provide consistent and timely feedback.  ➢ Teachers scaffold and differentiate the “process and products” in units to allow all students to achieve  successful outcomes.  ➢ Student facing agenda handouts for all students in all classrooms and all subject areas  ➢ Classes will be print rich: literature to support the essential ideas being taught will be provided to supplement  the curriculum, interactive word-walls will support vocabulary, student work will be displayed and showcased.         What is your vision for the use of a comprehensive assessment strategy (diagnostic, formative, benchmark, and  summative) to drive curricular, instructional, and organizational decisions that impact student outcomes?  Students will be assessed at the beginning of the year utilizing common periodic assessments in core subject areas to  ensure appropriate instructional support and courses. Common assessments aligned to Common Core and  respective regents exam will be given mid points in marking period and data analysis will be facilitated in content  and grade teams.

Part 2 – Summative Vision for Supportive Environment   What is your vision for a supportive school environment? How will you in partnership with each CBO and families  enact your vision?  Flushing High School is a student-centered environment where adults know and care about their students social,  emotional, and academic well-being. All community members have high expectations for themselves and others.  Through our Peer Group Connection program and all interactions, students are held to rigorous standards, and  consistently engage in rigorous work products that are relevant and challenging. Students are provided with  appropriate scaffolds to provide entry and access to the task. Teachers use student level data to inform instruction and  to ensure that students are challenged and supported.     The community based partners provide opportunities outside of the classroom for additional academic and social  emotional support that is in alignment with the school’s instructional vision, this includes Saturday and evening tutoring.

The teams utilized protocols to systemize looking at  student work to identify skill deficiencies and design appropriate instructional interventions.    Areas of Need:  - All teacher compensatory positions of the school are realigned directly to student needs.  -Grade Level Teams/Houses in which teachers, administrators and support staff are utilizing a collaborative approach to  support successful student outcomes while promoting distributed leadership, building collective and individual efficacy.  - Ensure that teachers co-develop lesson plans that use formative and summative data reflecting on the needs of all  learners.  -Ensure that teachers use data to group students, and provide learning activities that match the differing needs and  abilities of these different groups; provide students with actionable next steps for learning.  -Ensure that there are structures and protocols in place to have all the students in each grade level be known by the  adults in grade levels teams and that there are mechanism for student case conferencing in place.        Part 2 – Summative Vision for Collaborative Teachers   What is your vision for collaborative teaching?     2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      30      Vision for Collaborative Teachers at Flushing High School:      The staff of Flushing High School will be structured to achieve collective purpose and support focused on creating a  collaborative and nurturing environment where all staff members demonstrate mutual respect and are expected to  contribute actively to producing positive student outcomes and maintaining the well-being of our school. Flushing High  School strives to be a collaborative teaching and learning organization. Our teaching and learning happens  collaboratively, thereby building the leadership capacity and efficacy of all staff members. Distributed leadership and  shared decision making is a critical aspect of Flushing High School’s collaborative culture. Flushing High School will  create four Grade-level houses that includes teachers, administrators, licensed bilingual guidance counselors, CBO, and  other support staff across all subjects/areas of our schools tasked with working collaboratively to engage in student  case-conferencing, co-plan and design instructional materials, prepare lesson and unit plans, examine student work to  identify learner centered problems, problems of practice, and implement strategies. In order to create and sustain this  level of collaboration among all staff members at Flushing High School, program/matrix structures will be created and  provide for the cultivation of a student-centered teaching and learning environment that is focused on developing  collective responsibility by creating the mastery learning conditions that ensure successful student outcomes.      In our house structure, faculty will enhance pedagogical practices, refine content knowledge, building work-style  preferences and connection to colleagues, while ensuring the all students in the grade level are known and supported  by the adults in the house. The grade-level house, by operating as one team, creates a teaching and learning community  where all have voice in decision-making, progress will be measured by student outcomes, attendance, and level of  incidents. Grade level teams will meet 5 days per week and operate on the modified Circular 6 schedule: Monday:  Common Planning with ISS and ENL Partners (to be led by teacher partners), Tuesday: Skedula/Parent Engagement,  Wednesday: Strategic Planning and Student Outcomes, Thursday: Common Planning Time with ISS and ENL Partners (to  be led by the teacher partners), Friday: Other Professional Work (as per the Collective Bargaining Agreement).              How do you envision collaboration amongst your School Instructional Cabinet to improve teacher practices and  student learning?  Collaboration with the instructional cabinet to support successful student outcomes and improve teacher practice will  be through Cabinet Level Inquiry. The Cabinet Level Inquiry team includes all instructional supervisors and will meet  every other week for the entire school year 2018-2019.            How do you envision collaboration within teacher teams to improve teacher practices and student learning?   All teachers and support staff will meet daily in respective grade-level houses to engage in student case-conferencing,  co-plan and design instructional materials, prepare lesson and unit plans, analyze student work to uncover  patterns/trends, learner centered problems, problems of practice, and implement strategies to support successful  student outcomes.         How do you envision collaboration across teacher teams to improve teacher practices and student learning?   All teachers also participate in vertical/departmental teams on each Monday afternoon. During this time teachers  from all grade level teams will meet in departments to conduct regents inquiry, curriculum adaptation, and the   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      31      sharing of best practices from grade-level houses.

What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide,   Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review?   Strengths:  ➢ Parent coordinator has forged a strong relationship with the parent community and leads various workshops  throughout the school year, including Pupil Path workshops.  ➢ The school has created parent workshops to meet the needs of diverse groups, including students  in temporary housing.  ➢ The Community-based organization partners have engaged families in events like the Forum and the Spring  Barbeque.  ➢ The Community-based organization partners have engaged students vision screenings, provided glasses to students,  and has provided mental health  services to students.     Needs:  ➢ Parent/family turnout at events continues to be low; the school will plan events that take place at different  times throughout the day and into the evening and weekends.  ➢ Engaging families in dialogue about their children’s academic and social emotional growth continues to be a  struggle. Increased use of Skedula/Pupil Path by teachers and more timely feedback from teachers would improve two  way  communication.  ➢ Leverage parent coordinator, guidance counselors, parent coordinator, as strong points of contact at the school and   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      42      to   establish a relationship beginning in 9th grade to serve student and family needs.        Part 2 – Summative Vision for Strong Family and Community Ties   What is your vision for having strong family and community ties at your school?   In order for the school to address students’ social, emotional, and academic needs, there must be a strong partnership  with families. Forging and maintaining open dialogue between families and the school staff are crucial to student  success. We believe that families must have access to staff members, including school leadership, licensed bilingual  guidance counselors, and teachers. Knowing students well is critical, and families provide important insight into the  strengths, challenges and learning styles of their children. Strengthening the relationship between the Flushing  community and the school will yield great gains for the school in providing opportunities for students to engage in  internships, work based learning, and other community resources that the vibrant Flushing community has to offer.         Within the Community School model, how will families be welcomed into the school and made a part of the school  community?  What support will administrators, teachers, school staff and school safety officers be given to help create  a welcoming environment?   Will there be a dedicated space for families in the school?    We have already begun to place signage in the entrance way to ensure that families feel knowledgeable and welcome in  the building. School leadership, including the AP of Safety and Security and the Community School Director, will work  with School  Safety officers and School Aides to ensure that families are welcomed into the school upon arrival. Translators are  always available and can provide families with the tools that they need to ensure access to the staff member or  information that they require.     There will be a dedicated Family Welcome Center which will be located close to the main entrance and main office of  the school. The Family Welcome Center will be a comfortable space in the school that is designed for family and faculty  collaboration. The space will be family friendly so that families can comfortably come to school with their young  children.          How will the school identify and develop families to take leadership roles in school decision making/school  governance structures?    The Parent Coordinator, with the support of school leadership and the CSD, will work with the PTA president to ensure  that the school’s decision making bodies and governance structures have representation from a diverse group of  stakeholders. The Parent Coordinator will regularly provide opportunities to develop those who take on leadership  roles and encourage emerging leaders to attend such opportunities. Elections will be held to ensure that the process is  equitable and transparent.           How will the school engage the community and families? How will they ensure that teachers are able to learn from  families about the children being taught?  All students and families new to Flushing High School will take part in orientation. During the orientation for incoming  students, families will have the opportunity to share information about their child. This will continue over the summer  as all incoming ninth grade students will take part in the Summer Bridge program, and parents will be invited to the   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      43      school as part of the on-boarding process. Parent-teacher conferences will take place twice per year and we welcome  the parent perspective. Additionally, as an intervention, grade level houses will meet for case conferencing and will  invite families and students to join on a case by case basis. Furthermore, families are always welcome to come to  school to meet with a teacher or administrator, and there is weekly parent outreach time scheduled for teachers.         What types of supports does the school provide to families to encourage them to take an active role in what their  child is learning?   Type of Support   Rationale   English classes   Pupil Path workshops   New Student and Ninth Grade Orientation   College Workshops (FAFSA, college application process)   Providing families with the opportunity to improve their  English language skills will empower them to better  support their children. Additionally, families have  expressed interest in English classes, and we intend to  honor that request.   Pupil Path workshops are designed to provide families with  access to the online tool for communicating student  progress. During these sessions we will teach families how  to log on, how to interpret grades and to understand grade  level standards, and how to communicate with school  personnel about their child’s progress.      Additionally, families will learn and have the opportunity to  engage in dialogue about high school graduation  requirements.   Getting to know families early on and forging relationships  with these important stakeholders is critical to our  students’ success. We will set the tone for this during both  the New Student and Ninth Grade Orientations. At this  time we will communicate expectations for students and  families, tour key places in the school, introduce key staff  members and field questions related questions with the  goal being for families to feel comfortable in their child’s  school.   College workshops will be led by our college counselor and  will address topics that are relevant to the college  process.Workshops will begin as early as ninth grade with  the goal of exposing families early and often to topics that  may be new to them.         How do families partner with the school and CBO to support student success?  Will there be dedicated space for  families?    Family partnerships with  school:   The Parent Coordinator is the lead liaison between the school and families. The  parent coordinator maintains an ongoing dialogue with representatives from  stakeholder groups including: families, CBOs, guidance team and school leadership.      Family partnerships with CBO:   The Community Engagement Team will be comprised of parents, representation  from each CBO, licensed bilingual guidance counselors, deans and behavior   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      44   intervention specialists. The team will meet biweekly to review data, share updates  and engage in planning. The annual Community School Forum will be collaborative  effort to engage stakeholder groups and to elicit feedback for future planning.   Is there dedicated space for  these partnerships?         Yes.            What is your vision for the role the school will take in providing access adult education classes within the community?   Maintaining regular communication with families will enable our team to identify areas of need among the parent  community and to address the needs and desire for workshops and adult education classes within the community.  Affording our parent community with resources to foster their own engagement will benefit students and families alike.  Adult education classes and workshops include: English, technology and resume writing, supporting your  teenager in academics and social emotional growth, understanding the college process.         What data and student progress feedback loops will be present at the school to ensure that families knowledgeable of  their children’s scholastic success?  -Student work products and rubrics  -Pupil Path/Skedula for grade and attendance communication  -Report Cards  -Parent Teacher Conferences two times per year  -Case Conferencing       Part 3 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools – Strong Family and Community Ties.

ELT provides enriching  educational experiences that happen outside of the traditional school day and blend skill acquisition, relationship- building and fun to foster academic and social-emotional growth. Summer learning, afterschool programming, and  extended-day ELT models, when well-implemented, play a critical role in supporting students in all grades and ensuring  that they graduate from high school, college and career ready. SED requires that Priority schools offer a minimum of 200  additional student contact hours as Expanded Learning Time in addition to the current mandated length of 900 hours of  instruction per year (25 hours per week) in grades K-6 and 990 hours of instruction per year (27.5 hours per week) in  grades 7-12. Effective ELT models will blend school staff with community partners, and will provide a balanced  curriculum that can include ELA, math, STEM, arts, physical activity, and leadership development. Complete the sections  on this page to demonstrate how the school will meet these requirements.     Part 1 – ELT Program Goal(s)   Describe the summative goal(s) of the ELT program for the 2018-19 school year. Goals for ELT should align to the  Renewal Benchmarks.  How will the school will ensure that all students’ individual needs are served during the  Renewal ELT and how the school’s vision for ELT will impact both academic achievement and social emotional  growth? Be sure to construct the goal to be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.    In June 2019, the number of students across all grade levels earning 10 or more credits in the year  will be at least 63%.        Part 2 – ELT Program Type   Is the ELT program voluntary or compulsory?      Voluntary   X   Compulsory   Renewal ELT – Describe what accountability structures the school will employ to ensure participation of all students,  including special populations, will participate fully in Renewal ELT.  Additional ELT - If there is a voluntary ELT program in addition to the compulsory Renewal ELT, indicate how you will  actively encourage the participation of all students, with the goal of serving at least 50% of students.  Each student will have an additional hour of extended learning time from Tuesday to Friday for the entire school year.  In addition, Our community partnership with Center for Supportive Schools will be utilized to continue providing our  students with academic, social and emotional support. We will offer Saturday Academy for students identified as at- risk. During the school day, course offering and selections as part of our extended learning time will provide  individualized programming based on student need. The 9th grade students will take an additional English and Math  course to supplement their English and Algebra skill acquisition. Students in Grade 10 to Grade 12 will be  programmed with core classes that they need to graduate, skill deficient and/or are striving to attain college- readiness scores to meet commencement standards. English will also support on-track students with at least 12  Advanced Placement Courses, SAT preparation, and by providing the opportunity for a career education course track  that leads to industry certifications in Business and Entrepreneurship depending on student choice.

As a teaching and learning community, Flushing High School is striving to increase successful student outcomes at our  school and best prepare students for college and careers. We believe that this is done by implementing student – centered  instructional strategies to personalize learning around the needs and strengths of each student. We believe that in  order to achieve college and career readiness, students must engage in rigorous tasks and produce rigorous student  work products. For this to occur, curricula must be standards-based, classrooms must be student centered, including  differentiated instruction evidenced by alternative groupings in the classroom, and our literacy plan implemented  with fidelity across all classrooms. Differentiated professional development for all staff members to grow individually  as well as turn-key new learning. Teachers will also receive professional development to best support the learning  needs of different students (ELL, Special Education) and the inquiry based/student centered model of teaching and  learning. This includes flexible grouping/differentiation, connections across content, and focus on inquiry in essential  and focused questions, student engagement, and productive struggle. Our schedule will allow for teachers to  collaborate within their departments and grade level houses.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      66      semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/RSCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      67      Section 11: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Flushing High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of  the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      Flushing High School will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      68      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability  grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report,  Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      69      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act    ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between /teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.         School-Parent Compact (SPC)      School-Parent Compact (SPC)   Flushing High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (, is  implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between  the school and the families.

These benchmarks are set for overall improvement in individual  student learning and in the overall  school learning environment.  Furthermore, Flushing High School is a full comprehensive high  school with a population of 384  English Language Learners [ELLs] from 28 countries outside of the United States, representing  15 different languages.   The two  largest language populations are Spanish (317) and Cantonese/Chinese/Mandarin (38) followed  by Urdu (9),  Pashto and Punjabi (3  each).  English as a New Language (ENL) classes for the Entering, Emerging, Transitioning and  Expanding proficiency levels are  co-integrated with ELA [English Language Arts] and/or core content areas as per CR Part 154  for grades 9-12, ENL Units of Study  and Staffing Requirements.        The English language literacy skills in need of the greatest improvement are academic  writing, reading, and vocabulary for  success in core content area state assessments such as ELA , science, math, US and Global  history.   In addition, according to the  2017 ELL Analysis Data Tool (EDAT) for 9th and 10th graders, Flushing High School had: a)  75 students with English proficiency  advancement levels that could not be determined; b) 5 students advanced 3 levels; c) 31 students  advanced 2 levels; d) 74  students advanced 1 level; e) 58 students remained the same; 10 students regressed 1 level; and,  2 students regressed 2 levels.        The EDAT results for the 2017-2018 school year identified the following types of ELLs  based on years of service: a) 197  Newcomers - 0 to 3 years of service ; b) 52 Developing students - 4 to 6 years of service;  and,  76 Long Term students - 7 to 13  years of service.  In addition, there were 31 SIFE [Students with Interrupted/Inconsistent Formal  Education] ; and, 52 ELLs with  learning disabilities also known as students with disabilities [SWD].   The 2017 NYSESLAT  [New York State English as a Second  Language Achievement Test] data for 9th and 10th graders indicated the number of students for  each English language  proficiency level were as follows: 24 on the Entering level;  87 on the Emerging level; 70 on the  Transitioning level; 74 on the  Expanding level; and, 16 on the Commanding level.  Commanding level students are students  who have "tested out"  or whose  English language skills have been evaluated as proficient according to their NYSESLAT results  for the productive modality   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      76      Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   language skills [speaking/writing]; and, for the receptive modality language skills [listening/  reading].  Commanding level  students' official class codes identify them as former ELLs.  As former ELLs, Commanding level  students continue to receive ENL  [English as a New Language, formerly referred to as ESL -English as a Second] services and  testing accommodations for an  additional two school years.         The  2017 NYSESLAT data was used to design targeted instruction for the Title III program:  36 students received a zero score for  the Writing section while 49 students left the section blank; and, 6 students received a zero for  the Speaking section with 49  students leaving the Speaking section blank.  Furthermore, 49 students left the Reading section  blank; and, 1 student received a  zero for the Listening section.       The following subgroups in grades 9 through 12 will be targeted for extra academic and  social/emotional support through  the Title III afterschool program: Newcomers, Long Term ELLs, SIFE [students with interrupted  or inconsistent formal education]  and ELLs with learning disabilities.  According to the EDAT and NYSESLAT data for 9th and  10th grades, there were 48 Long Term  ELLs; 30 ELLs with learning disabilities; 95 Newcomers; 13 SIFE and 98 ELLs.  These students  have failed 1 to 3 required core  content area state assessments.        In addition, data analyzed from the Spanish Periodic Assessment, given to over 200 native  Spanish speaking students,  identified the need for instruction in academic writing and reading in Spanish as well as  comprehending and incorporating  higher level academic Spanish vocabulary in oral and written responses.  Therefore, the Title III  program will include recruiting  native Spanish speakers with low Spanish Periodic Assessment scores.  Instruction will  be  provided in Spanish by two Spanish  LOTE instructors {Nadia Morales and Veronica McKay].           The academic and social/emotional counseling support services for ELL and immigrant  students will run from October 3,  2018 through May 31, 2019 for 27 weeks.  The program will run for 2 afternoons a week on  Wednesdays and Fridays from 3:45pm  until 5:15pm; and, on Saturdays from 10am until 12pm.  Instruction and services will be  provided by two ENL certified teachers; two  Spanish bilingual paraprofessionals [Lourdes Sobrino and Elia Colarusso]; one Chinese bilingual  social worker/counselor [Sean  Changlai]; one guidance counselor [Antonio Bausone]; four Spanish LOTE teachers [Veronica  MacKay and Nadia Morales for  students; and, Betty Solis and Celia Rios for parents]; and, three core content area teachers  [science, math, and social studies] will  collaborate and co-teach with the ENL teachers in delivering science, math and social studies  instruction as covered in state  assessments and city and state academic expectations.          Instruction will be delivered in English to two classes of students in grades 9 and 10; two  classes of students in grades 11 and 12;  and, one class for Spanish HLA/Bilingual grades 9-10 and one class for grades 11-12 with  support from content area teachers.    2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      77      Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   Within the first week, recruited ELLs and immigrant students will be administered an assessment  to identify the core content  area struggles as well as the language modality/modalities needing the most focus and  practice.    Furthermore, ELL   instruction will be designed to strengthen academic English language literacy/comprehension  skills and academic knowledge in  the core content areas as per the subject area curriculum; state standards; and, city and state  expectations.  Native Spanish  speaking students will receive instruction in Spanish with transitions into academic English as  covered by state assessments and  Home Language Arts Progressions [HLAP].  General instruction for core content subject areas  will be delivered in English with  native language support, and in Spanish for the HLA focus with English support.         The following resources will be utilized throughout the program for English and Spanish  academic instruction: ENL strategies  and methodologies such as SIOP [Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol],  Advanced  Literacy Hallmarks, Robert  Marzano.s vocabulary techniques, and Freeman and Freeman strategies for ELLs and struggling  readers.  Other resources to be  utilized include Home Language Arts Progressions; Spanish LOTE instructors; Chinese bilingual  counselor; Spanish bilingual  paraprofessionals; native language bilingual glossaries and text materials; and, educational  computer software programs such as  Achieve3000, BrainPop, and Genius Plaza, which all include versions of Spanish  translations.  The computer software programs  are designed to build English reading, writing and vocabulary literacy awareness.   Additional  supplemental academic English  materials include the ELA Collections curriculum and New Visions curriculum for math, science  and social studies; online  websites specifically for ELLs  such as Manythings.org; Learnersdictionary; and Freerice.com,  providing additional practice in  learning academic English.  Learnerpal computer software program as well  Read 180 and  System44 will be incorporated to  strengthen reading literacy and higher order core content thinking skills for struggling learners.         English language and computer literacy classes and counseling services will be offered for  parents on Saturdays from October  16th through June 1st, 10am until 12pm.  Instruction will be in both English and Spanish with  other native language support via  instructor, bilingual glossaries, and translated materials.  Instructors will use the following  computer programs: Achieve3000  [reading, writing, and vocabulary in English and Spanish] , Pupilpath [student grades, transcripts,  class assignments, anecdotal  notes, attendance, etc], and BrainPop [short videos for ELLs on core content knowledge and  skills ] as well as exposure to ELL  specific online websites such as: Learnersdictionary.com, Manythings.org and  Freerice.com.   There will be six cultural  /educational excursions for parents offered in October, November, February, March, April and  May on Saturdays.  Parents will be  notified [in advance] of the start and end times for the cultural events/excursions, based on the  hours of operation for each   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      78         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   excursion.  Parents will have access to a guidance counselor and/or social worker for  conferencing about student transcripts,  graduation requirements and any other outstanding academic concerns.           All records will be maintained in a binder  listing  classes, student registration forms,  recruiting flyers, attendance, emergency  contact information, school schedule during the day, targeted support needed, student trackers  and assessment monitoring  student progress, home contact along with logs of student/teacher conferences.  Teachers will  also include in their binders  evidence that they have participated in their scheduled professional development sessions.  These  binders will be safe guarded in  the office of the Assistant Principal of ENL/LOTE to be distributed on Wednesdays, Fridays and  Saturdays when the program is in  session.

There were over 200 native  Spanish speakers, 30 native Chinese  speakers with the remaining students speaking languages such as: Urdu, Pashto, Punjabi,  Bengali, Arabic, Thai, Hindi, Italian,  French Creole, Haitian Creole, etc.  The four year graduation rate remained under 65% for all  students.  There was nearly a 14% -  16% drop in the June 2018 ELA Regents pass rate with a slightly higher pass rate in math.  ENL  students struggled in meeting the   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      79      Part C: Professional Development   pass rate for the core content state assessments.  The teaching staff consisted of over 100  teachers 7 of which were ENL certified,  9 Spanish LOTE teachers, 1 Chinese LOTE teacher, and 4 teachers providing math and social  studies bilingual instruction.   Professional development will be offered to all teachers highlighting ENL strategies specific to  each core content area [ELA, math,  science, and social studies] curriculum and city and state expectations  (BLUEPRINT for  ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS (ELLs)  SUCCESS, 2014).        Workshops will be facilitated by trained consultants with expertise in blended learning  strategies for ELL populations using  Achieve3000, Learnerpal, Genius Plaza, Brainpop , Read 180 and System44 computer based  reading, writing and vocabulary  programs.  In addition, consultants from RBE-RN [Regional Bilingual Education Resource  Network will facilitate workshops to  support improved learning outcomes for academic oral and written language skills in the  bilingual and Home Language Arts  (HLA) courses.  The Assistant Principal of ENL/LOTE (Debra Lavache) will facilitate two ENL  professional development workshops.   The first workshop will focus on designing effective lesson plans with differentiated tasks based  on the English language  proficiency level.  The second workshop will introduce teachers to social emotional learning  [SEL] strategies to prepare ELLs for  success when completing rigorous academic tasks in all core content areas.       Workshops will be conducted each month to groups of 10 teachers,  session,  beginning the  last week in October  through the first week in June, from 3:45pm until 5:15pm.  Topics will be presented as follows:  understanding NYSESLAT results to  design data driven instruction; building background content knowledge for comprehension of  rigorous instruction; building  academic vocabulary skills appropriate for each English proficiency level;  developing grade  level academic reading and writing  strategies for varied genres; writing appropriate content and language objectives in alignment  with the curriculum's learning  objectives; using blended learning strategies to improve ELLs' technology and academic skills;  using state and teacher created  assessments to drive instruction and to address the needs of struggling learners; utilizing the  advanced literacy hallmarks to  prepare students for rigorous core content area tasks; learning co-teaching models for co- integrated instruction; and,  implementing SEL strategies to improve ELLs' academic outcomes in rigorous learning  environments.       Each workshop will include tips and resources regarding student tracking tools and methods  centered around the four  language modalities [Reading, Writing, Speaking and Listening]; maintaining student portfolios  for teacher and student  assessment/reflection; addressing attendance issues for ELLs with long term absences [LTAs];  and, use of rubrics//assessments to  monitor, adjust, and discuss areas of progress and challenges during student conferences and/or  for student self-reflections.   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      80         Part C: Professional Development        All agendas and sign-in sheets with participant names and departments will be kept in a  binder identifying the  vendor/facilitator providing the training; topic(s); rationale; teacher artifacts of session activities;  and, teacher feedback surveys.

Pupilpath  can also be accessed via mobile devices using an app.  Parents unable to attend PTA meetings  need support in learning about  available academic, social and English language acquisition services and opportunities as well as  receiving training in establishing  Pupilpath accounts.  In addition, ELL parents unavailable during school hours still need access to  guidance counseling as a  resource in understanding their child/children's academic transcript and progress towards  meeting the graduation  requirements.  All ELL and/or parents of immigrant students need access to information  regarding the cultural diversity of the  school and surrounding communities.  Providing parents with computer literacy and English  language literacy skills will support  parents' in successfully navigating and communicating within native English language  environments.  Parents need support in  negotiating educational/formal learning systems in order to participate in their children's  educational endeavors.   Furthermore,  non-native English speaking parents/guardians should have opportunities to share knowledge  about their cultures and native  languages to help others understand the importance of cultural diversity in building true  community.        Through a computer literacy campaign, ELL parents will receive training on accessing a  username and password for the  PupilPath program.   Pupilpath provides authorized users with student report card grades,  transcripts information, state  assessment scores, anecdotal comments about student behavior and important course  information, attendance records, class  schedules, class assignments, and college and career tracking information.  As a email address if  needed to create a Pupilpath   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      81      Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    account, parents without an email address will learn how to create on.  Parents will also learn  how to use Achieve3000, a  computer based literacy program, as a means to improve their English language reading and  vocabulary literacy skills.  This  program has an updated Spanish bilingual feature where parents can read articles in Spanish as  well as have the articles and  vocabulary read aloud for them as they follow along.   In addition,  parents will be able to review  the work produced by any of their  children utilizing the program as well.   Parents will receive a list of ELL friendly websites such  as Learnersdictionary.com;  manythings.org and Freerice.com to improve their receptive [listening and reading] and  productive [speaking and writing]  vocabulary skills in English.  The Freerice.com website includes vocabulary practice with  academic Spanish words.       Parents will participate in culturally relevant excursions and events once a month on  Saturdays throughout the course of the  program.  These excursions will include trips to the Flushing branch library, where parents can  apply for library cards.  New York  City library cards now allow members free admission to museums and other cultural events  throughout the city.   Excursions will  be organized by Betty Solis and Nadia Morales.   Teachers will conduct parent surveys to  identify other places of interests and  importance to visit.  Parent workshops will be adjusted to meet the needs of parents as per  surveys that will be provided to  parents throughout the program.      Guidance counseling services will be available during the program's operational hours,  Wednesday & Friday from 3:45pm until  5:15pm; once a month on Saturdays from 10am until 12pm for parents needing additional  support in reviewing/understanding  academic transcripts or to discuss student social/emotional issues.  These services will be  provided by Sean Changlai, Chinese  speaking social worker/guidance counselor and/or Antonio Bausone,  Spanish LOTE teacher  Veronica MacKay as will as Spanish  bilingual paraprofessionals Lourdes Sobrino and Elia Colarusso will assist with any  interpretation assistance needed or requested  for Spanish speaking parents.  Other translation sources/resources will be utilized for parents  speaking languages other than  Chinese or Spanish.       Parent coordinator, Ms. Mary Vacarr, will participate in recruiting efforts for parents of ELLs  and immigrant students via  distribution of flyers at PTA and other parent meetings.    Telephone messages in English,  Spanish and Chinese will be sent to  ELL parent homes through the school messenger system.  Translated backpacked letters in  parents' native languages and flyers  will be distributed by guidance counselors to parents; and, by ENL and bilingual teachers in their  stand alone and co-integrated  classes.  Additional flyers and letters will be distributed during Parent/Teacher  Conferences.  Information will also be shared on  the school website as well.   Finally, Title III staff members will make telephone calls to ELL  families using the NYCDOE telephone  translation and interpretation services..   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      82   Part D: Parental Engagement Activities                        Professional salaries  (schools must account for  fringe benefits)                              Per session    Per diem   Purchased services     High quality staff   and curriculum  development  contracts.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?       We use several methods that guide our instructional planning for ELLs which also support our scaffolding, differentiation  and student grouping strategies.   We use the NYSITEL assessment for newly identified ELLs; the NYSESLAT for our continuing  ELLs; Spanish LAB-R for our Spanish speaking ELLs; the SIFE Survey for our students whose formal education was interrupted  and/or inconsistent.  The LENS exam generates data identifying a student's math, reading and vocabulary skill level in the  home language . In addition, the Spanish LAB-R is only administered when a Spanish speaking student is identified as an ELL.  We also administer the Spanish Periodic Assessment to students assigned to the Home Language Arts courses to identify a  student's proficiency level in writing in his/her native language.       Scores from the NYSITEL and NYSESLAT identify the English language proficiency level and identify the language modalities  the student is struggling with or has the greatest strength.  This data is utilized to design appropriate scaffolds and   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      85      differentiation strategies that will support the student's ability to successfully interface and engage in grade level content tasks  and work products as dictated by the state curriculum standards.  The Spanish LAB-R data is utilized in the Home Language  Arts [HLA] courses to support the development of appropriate scaffolds and differentiation strategies that will support the  student in building his/her academic language and literacy skills in the native/home language.  The data from the SIFE Survey  alerts the teacher to the gaps in exposure to academic content and language skills.  This needs to be addressed when  designing grade level tasks by providing background information and the modeling of grade level tasks.   The data from  the Lens exam identifies a specific area [math, reading and vocabulary] that a student has a strength or a weakness in their  home language and/or the targeted language.  The instructional planning would include appropriate scaffolds to strengthen  both language and content to  improve grade level learning outcomes.        All ENL students are administered baseline assessments throughout the year in their core content areas.  The data  is analyzed and evaluated during Grade Level House and content department inquiry team meetings.  This data is directly used  to inform how instruction is implemented to support student success in improving grade level literacy skills through  exposure to content based curriculum.              2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   ENL teachers participate in Department inquiry groups with their content area co-teachers twice a month during the Monday  Department staff PDs and once a week in their Grade Level House meetings.  In addition, ENL teachers have an opportunity to  collaborate on lesson and unit planning using ELL data during the ENL Department meetings twice a month as well as twice a  week during the co-planning days in their Grade Level Houses with their content area co-teacher(s).  Each Grade Level House  follows the DataWise inquiry protocol.  In these sessions, the ENL teachers have the opportunity to analyze student work  products including baseline assessments that are given to all students.  Using the Spanish Periodic Assessment, the Spanish  HLA teachers also participate in inquiry groups to analyze the  student work of the Spanish speaking ENL students.  ENL, HLA ,  and LOTE [Languages Other Than English] teachers all participate in ENL/LOTE Department inquiry PDs twice a month to  review all assessment data and reports including Spanish and Chinese LOTE Regents results from the previous  year.  LOTE teachers are also being trained in desegregating NYSESLAT and other ELL related data reports .  This provides data  driven instruction for for all ENL students in their Chinese and Spanish HLA/LOTE classes.  Four days a week ENL and  HLA teachers participate in Grade Level House meetings following this schedule: Monday: Common Planning; Tuesday:  Skedula/Parent Outreach; Wednesday: Literacy Inquiry; Thursday: Common Planning; and Friday: Teacher Professional Work  Responsibilities such as lesson study and preparing/grading student assessment.       3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Subject area baseline assessments are used to identify progress and areas of need.  These are assessments are also used in the  Grade level House Regents and Literacy inquiry work.  Last year a HLA assessment was administered to Spanish HLA courses  and analyzed by all Spanish LOTE teachers during Department Monday inquiry meetings twice a .month.  This year, all  LOTE teachers have been divided into Spanish level teams including those teaching native/HLA classes and will administer a  teacher generated baseline assessment to analyze Spanish literacy levels.  We also compare EDAT  reports tool as a benchmark of our progress in improving the English language proficiency rate;  however, we are aware that each year presents different types of challenges for educators and students.         4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Flushing High School is a strong supporter of collaborative learning and small group instruction.  These structures are in place  on a daily basis through the design of scaffolds, differentiated  tasks, visual aid and strategic grouping/re-grouping of  students based on the focused language skill and/or content.  Students are provided native language support in the form of  translated materials and access to bilingual language dictionaries.  Teachers and counselors recommend ENL students to  participate in the Title III afterschool programs, Regents preparation courses, activities sponsored by the Community Based   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      86         Organizations housed in the building, and tutoring during extended hours.  In addition, teachers participate in Grade Level  House inquiry meetings where student work products are analyzed for learner centered problems (LCP).  As the LCP  [skill] is  identified, inquiry teams collaborate to design rigorous tasks and lesson plans to support improving student learning  outcomes.  Inquiry tennis charts are used to monitor targeted students' progress towards mastery of a particular skill.  ENL  teachers are receiving SIOP (Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol) training to improve the implementation of specific  ENL strategies and techniques for struggling learners.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A       6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, and state Regents results in ELA, Math, Science and Social Studies are used to program our Freestanding  and Integrated ENL courses.  The results from the AP Spanish and LOTE Regents [Spanish/Chinese] are also used  in ENL, ENL/ISS, and Home Language Arts programming.  Once ELL students are programmed, the Spanish Lab-R results are  used to identify native language pre-literacy challenges by the ENL and HLA teachers.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   NYSESLAT reports are disseminated and discussed collaboratively twice a month during ENL/LOTE Department PD Monday  meetings to identify areas of  struggle in the 4 language modalities (reading, writing, listening and speaking).  ENL teachers are  guided to share and explain findings to their co-integrated subject area teachers during Grade Level House co-planning  meetings  twice a week and during any other co-planning discussions/communications.   NYSESLAT and NYSITELL data results is  also shared with the Programming Chair  and guidance counselors, who are responsible for programming all incoming ELL  students throughout the year.  IEP reports are used in the programming of ENL students with IEPs, which can be accessed from  the SESIS computer site.  ENL teachers continue to be trained to confirm , via official class code and NYSESLAT scores, that ENL  students have been properly programmed in their ENL course.  THE ENL Coordinator in collaboration with the Program Chair  review ENL and Bilingual programs and make adjustments as accordingly.  Guidance counselors are being trained to do the  same.  Bilingual teachers communicate with their subject area supervising Assistant Principals regarding placement concerns of  ELL students in their subject area bilingual courses.           Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented as per CR Part 154.2 as   well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students regardless of grade are in one class],  heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   All ELLs receive individual programs based on NYSESLAT English proficiency, grade level, credit accumulation requirements, Regents, and  IEP compliance data.  Each course is 47 minutes  except period 9 Tuesdays through Fridays, which is 1 hour long.  There is no period 9 on  Mondays due to Monday Department PD meetings.  All instruction is delivered 5 days a week.  ENL students programmed for 3 ENL courses  receive a minimum of 705 minutes a week; ENL students programmed for 2 ENL courses receive a minimum of 470 minutes a week; and, ENL  students programmed for 1 ENL course receives a minimum of 235 minutes a week.  Students are programmed by 2 contiguous grade level  brands for each course [grades 9/10 or 11/12).  Instruction in the ENL stand alone course follow the ELA Collection curriculum and by subject  area curriculum by grade.    As per CR Part 154-2 for grades 9-12, Entering and Emerging level students receive 3 periods of ENL; 1 period stand alone, 1 period with an  integrated ELA co-teacher and 1 period in a content area (science).  This meets the 540 minutes for Entering and 360 minutes for Emerging level   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      87         students.    Entering and Emerging level Spanish speaking ENL students in the bilingual program receive 1 period each of bilingual math and  bilingual social studies in addition to 1 period of HLA (Home Language Arts).   Transitioning and Expanding Level students receive 2 periods of ENL to meet the 180 minute requirement.  Transitioning level students are  required to receive 1 stand alone ENL/core integrated and 1 integrated ELA course.  The Expanding level students are required to have  1 integrated ELA course.  However, Transitioning and Expanding level students in the same 2 contiguous grade level bands are programmed for  1 stand alone and 1 integrated ELA course.  In addition, Transitioning and Expanding level Spanish speaking bilingual students are programmed  for 1 HLA class and 1 bilingual class in either math or social studies.   Commanding Level students, former ELLs,  receive 2 additional years of ENL support.  They are programmed for 1 ELA integrated course.            b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Spanish speaking ELL students are programmed for the social studies and math bilingual courses as per parent choice and proficiency  level.  These classes are homogeneous, multi-grade and organized by proficiency levels as well as Regents and credit accumulation  requirements.  Spanish bilingual students have an official class code beginning with an "S".  A "QA" at the end of the course codes identify the  social studies and math bilingual courses.  There are 2 teachers who teach social studies and 2 teachers for math bilingual instruction.     c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A     2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 below)?   All ENL students receive the proper ENL minutes according to their language proficiency level as mandated by the CR Part 154 (2) Unit of Study Chart for  grades 9 through 12 adhered to by the Program Chair and guidance counselors when programming ELL students throughout the year.   ELLs are  programmed by 2 contiguous grade level brands for each course [grades 9/10 or 11/12). Programs are routinely reviewed throughout the year to  confirm accuracy.  Adjustments are made to correct any errors.      All ELL stand alone and integrated instruction is delivered 5 days a week for 47 minutes each - periods 1 through 8 on Mondays; and, for 1 hour for  period 9 Tuesdays through Fridays.  There is no period 9 class on Mondays due to Monday Department PD sessions.  Entering/Emerging students  programmed for 3 ENL courses receive a minimum of 705 minutes a week: 1 stand alone, 1 ELA integrated and 1 core integrated, generally a science  course.  Transitioning/Expanding ELLs have been programmed for ELA integrated courses for a minimum of 235 minutes a week.  In some cases,  Commanding ELLs have been programmed with the Transitioning and Expanding level students according to individual course needs.  The Commanding,  or former ELLs, receive 2 additional years of ENL support in an ELA integrated class.  Science integrated classes are mixed grades but are programmed by  language proficiency levels.   Other considerations are based on IEP compliance requirements.  Spanish speaking bilingual ELLs on the Entering, Emerging, Transitioning or Expanding level receive one period of HLA 5 days,  235 minutes a week           3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and methods used to make content   comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards.     All ENL teachers co-teach with either an ELA, science and/or ISS content area teacher.  For the social studies and math courses, there are 2  bilingual teachers in each subject area, who deliver instruction according to the transitional bilingual model as outlined in the ELL Policy and Reference  Guide.   Each course uses the content area curriculum: Collections for ELA and New Visions for science.  Instruction is delivered in English with native  language support as well as providing translated materials as part of providing appropriate scaffolded and differentiated strategies.  In addition, ENL  teachers employ strategic grouping techniques  for targeted small group instruction to ensure all students have access and comprehend the grade level  content materials.  This also creates multiple entry points in building students' English language skills.  ENL teachers also being trained to use the  baseline content area results to anticipate language and content areas of struggles in unit and lesson plans.  New ENL teachers are being introduced to  and experienced teachers are being retrained in the SIOP (Sheltered Instruction  Observation``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` Protocol)  model.  Their content area co-teachers are scheduled to train with them in a January workshop.  The SIOP training includes the co-teaching models.  ENL  teachers participate in co-planning sessions twice a week during the Grade Level House meetings and twice a month for the Monday  Department   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      88      inquiry.     All teachers of ELLs follow the school wide literacy plan with ENL teachers learning to design appropriate content and language entry points for all  English proficiency levels.  In addition, all ENL teachers have attended or will attend ENL PDs to continue learning how to implement ELL strategies and  techniques to improve student learning outcomes.  HLA teachers follow the HLA curriculum to improve students' native language literacy skills.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?     Native Spanish and Chinese speakers are in native language arts or Spanish Heritage classes 5 days a week.  AP Debra Lavache is responsible for  instruction in that department.  Spanish LOTE, Chinese LOTE and HLA instruction follows the school literacy plan.  These language instructors are creating  baseline assessments for each course level,  and participate in Grade Level House inquiry ensuring that students are regularly evaluated in their home  language.  Spanish Regents results are analyzed during Department inquiry meetings twice a month to identify areas of strength and struggles.  The  Chinese LOTE teacher also analyzes results from the Chinese Regents. Students are given the SIFE survey in their native languages.  ELL students who the  low incidence languages and meet the credit requirements are provided the opportunity to take that the LOTE Regents at another location, providing  additional data on the student's native language skills.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    ENL teachers analyze the ATS reports that identify the SIFE , ENL/ISS, and ELL Years of Service  as well as the NYSESLAT results to identify areas of  struggle within the 4 language modalities.  ENL teachers are being trained to use this data for targeted grouping, scaffolding, and to create tasks based  on student struggles and strengths.  This data is to be used to identify learning gaps in content and language skills.  Three ENL teachers who have all co- integrated programs are learning to use various student assessment and tracking tools to monitor student progress and communicate their findings to  their co-teacher.  This information is also to be used during the co-planning time to adapt the curriculum materials accordingly..  Students are also  learning to use self and peer assessment tools to monitor their own progress.         6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic content areas and accelerate   English language development?   ENL teachers have been programmed for ISS co-integrated ELA classes.  ENL teachers who co-teach with an ISS self-contained teacher are being trained  in the ICT model.  The SIOP training will also support ENL teachers in this area in addition to working with their ISS co-teacher during co-planning time in  the Grade Level House meetings twice a week.  ENL teachers are being trained to compare the various ELL ATS data such as the NYSESLAT and  EDAT results to determine the areas of need for each ENL/ISS student.  The goal this year is for the ISS and ENL/LotE Department Assistant Principals to  work together to identify workshops and share instructional materials to assist with adapting grade level content curriculum to improve learning  outcomes for the ENL/ISS students.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and attain English proficiency   within the least restrictive environment?  New ENL teachers will be trained and experienced ENL teachers will be re-trained to use the SESIS computer site to identify the learning needs of the  ENL/ISS student.  This information will also identify testing accommodations that can be incorporated when giving the ENL/ISS student any class  assessment.  All ENL teachers will be encouraged to identify the differences between a language acquisition challenge versus a learning challenge not  related to a language struggle.  ENL teachers will be trained on using RTI (Response to Intervention) to create tasks, scaffolds and differentiated  opportunities specially designed for the ENL/ISS students. ENL teachers will attend IEP meetings to better understand the needs of the students and to  be able to work closely with the ISS teacher to create appropriate interventions for each ENL/ISS student.  The Tile III program offers additional support from 2 Spanish bilingual paraprofessionals, 2 Spanish bilingual guidance counselors, 1 Chinese bilingual  social worker who have experience working with ENL/ISS students.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups targeted).  List the range of   intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which they are offered.   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      89      The Title III LEP and Immigrant programs offer additional support 3 days a week [Tuesday, Wednesday and Saturday] for students needing extra  academic and language support in ELA, math, science or social studies provided in English, Spanish and Chinese.  There are 2 Spanish LOTE teachers (Ms.  Morales and Ms. MacKay), 1 ENL/Chinese LOTE teacher (Ms. Zhang), 2 Spanish bilingual guidance counselors (Ms. Fabre and Ms. Moya), 1 College and  Career counselor (Mr. Bausone), 1 Chinese bilingual social worker (Ms. Changlai) and 2 Spanish paraprofessionals (Ms. Colarusso and Ms. Sobrino).  Ms.  Solis will work with the parents on Saturdays for additional language support in English and/or Spanish.  She will also train parents in registering and  using the Skedula/IO Classroom to monitor student academics and behavior.  Bilingual glossaries, dual language books/materials and a computer based  program (Actively Learn) will be purchased to further support the needs of the ENL students in the various content areas.  Actively Learn is a computer  based reading and writing comprehension program that offers content material support material in 30 different native languages.  This program is  owned by the developers of the Achieve3000 computer based literacy program. The Title III program is designed to offer Regents support for all ELL  students as well.  ENL teachers will identify each marking period ELL students with failing grades who have at least 75% attendance rate.  They will use the existing ELL  data to create appropriate content and language tasks, scaffolds such as templates and graphic organizers to improve student performance and use a  student tracking tool to monitor their progress.  This will also include one-one conferences with the student, provide additional native language  translated materials, home communication, working with the students' guidance counselors and content area co-integrated teacher.  ENL teachers will continue to attend ELL related PDs , which will also be shared with Assistant Principals of Supervision to recommend their content area  teachers of ELLs to receive training.  In-house ELL PDs will be offered to train teachers of ELLs in curriculum adaptation, targeted grouping, small group  instruction, task and assessment design, use of Over-the-phone Translation and Interpretation Services, etc.                       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Flushing High School experienced a re-staffing in the last school year (2017-2018) and have hired a number of new teachers in all areas including ENL and  LOTE.  These teachers will need to be trained in implementing ELL strategies and techniques to improve language acquisition and content knowledge.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We do not intend to discontinue and current services.       11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in your building.   There are no limits to any program for ELLs. Some courses have pre-requisites and those apply the same way they would for any student.   If an ELL  wants to participate, they have to request it and they will be placed in the class, sport team, club or Student Government.  Backpacked letters home are  translated, telephone messages home are delivered in English, Spanish and Chinese.  School announcements are delivered everyday in English, Spanish  and Chinese.  Translation services are provided at all parent workshops and PTA meetings, notices sent through Skedula/IO Classroom are translated into  the native language of the parent.  There are 2 Spanish bilingual guidance counselors.  Every staff member have been given, in person at the start of the  year and via email, the instructions for using the Over-the-phone Translation and Interpretation  Services to communicate in the native language of the  parent or guardian.   Translation services in-person and via phone are offered during Parent Teacher Conferences.  New ELL parents receive ELL Parent Orientation materials  and video in their native language to learn about the various programs offered for ELLs.  A poster and brochures are readily available to parents who  enter the building to point to their native language, which then the staff member can locate another staffer who speaks that language or can contact the  Over-the phone services.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language materials; list ELL subgroups   if necessary.  The department adopted Milestone textbooks to help integrate the CCSS.  This is the textbook adopted by the statewide by the State of California as  their textbook to help ELLS integrate the CCSS.  We also added this year the EngageNY grade 9 and 10 units of study along with the AIR Secondary  Curriclular Units for NYCDOE prepared y the NYCDOE Office of English Langauge Learners.  In addition, each students used the Achieve 3000 online  software 2 days a week in the beginner and intermediate levels and 1 day a week in the advanced level.  ESL teachers pushed-in to Science classes as one  of the periods of ESL for beginners.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      90      Spanish  (22% of our population) have four years of Native Langauge Arts in their home langauges. .  Spanish-speaking students have an opportunity to  take the AP Spanish Languag  e course in their junior year and take the AP Literature course in their senior year.  Students who can take these courses are chosen by teacher  recommendation.        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All core content areas follow that subject area's curriculum based on grade level.   Approximately two years ago ELA courses changed to the Collections  curriculum and the other content areas changed to New Visions curriculum.  ENL stand alone classes follow the ELA Collections curriculum.  Each year  content department provide curriculum materials as part of routine academic audits.  Each year NYSTL monies are used to update textbooks and  curriculum materials for all courses as needed.  In addition, blended learning is implemented using such programs as Castle Learning, which teachers  were trained on during the Election Day Chancellor's PD.  Translated materials including translated versions of Regents exams are used to improve  content knowledge and language skills.         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the ELLs’ needs (academic,   linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Two staff members from the Veritas High School (Ms. Morales and Mr. Bausone) participate in the Title III program.  Students from the co-located  schools were invited to attend the Thanksgiving Cultural Celebration and Potluck Feast.  Every year the library is shared in administering the Speaking  section of the NYSESLAT.  This year Queens High School of Language Studies will assist Flushing High School with administering all sections of the Chinese  LOTE in June as it is now required that a "disinterested" teacher administer the LOTE exams. During Regents week in January and June Flushing High  School shares its bilingual dictionaries/glossaries.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for new ELLs who enroll   throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, parent coordinator).   The ENL Coordinator (Ms. Solis) enrolls newly arrived ELLs during the summer and addresses any questions, conducts Parent Orientation meetings in the  parent's/guardian's native language, introduces the student to school protocols.  During the enrollment process, the ENL Coordinator identifies the  home  language once it is determined the student is an ELL.  There are 2 new Spanish bilingual guidance counselors, who are learning to explain to new  ELLs their new class programs, how to access their student information on Skedula, and what to do if their need academic assistance.  The Parent  Coordinator (Ms. Vacarr) also provides information about various social resources for new parents and students including ELL families.  Many of the  resources she supplies is provided in multiple native languages (Spanish, Chinese, Urdu, Bengali, Arabic), etc.  These resources include obtaining library  cards, identification, immigration information and access to other social services.    If translation is needed a staff member is called in or the Language Translation Unit is called.  New students receive a blue emergency card  (English/Spanish), a form the provides the pupil accounting secretary with information for ATS, a history of schools attended, the HLIS, Federal  Parent/Guardian Student Ethnic & Race Identification, a bell schedule, a Residency Questionnaire to determine if the student is in temporary housing. In  addition, parents are helped in applying for Free or Reduced Lunch online so that the students will have lunch available to them the next day.   Families  also meet with the Supervising School Aide who will give the student a metro card.   Eligible students are administered the NYSITELL, SIFE interview  Survey and Spanish Lab.  Students then receive their ENL, HLA and/or Bilingual class program.       17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    ELLs can take AP level courses in Spanish and Chinese.  ELLs are eligible to take any elective that the school offers.   Students can also study piano, band,  chorus, painting, Studio Art or a CTE course.  These classes are only offered in English.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day (percentage) EPs and ELLs are   integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.  N/A        Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same time (simultaneous)?     2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      91      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  ENL teachers participated in a SIOP PD in November and will participate in 3 more training sessions this school year.  The co- integrated teachers will receive at least 1 SIOP training.  The Language Access Coordinator (Ms. Suarez), has attended a  training regarding coordinator responsibilities.  The math and social studies bilingual teachers (Ms. Rodriguez and Mr. Avila for  math; Mr. Leon and Mr. Rodriguez for social studies) received training along with bilingual resource materials on the  Transitional Bilingual Education model by ENL/LOTE AP Lavache in October.  All of the Title II staff received ELL related training  and will continue to receive training throughout the course of the program.   Staff ELL related PD has been offered as a per  session activity and will be offered again.  Training facilitated by RBRN -Fordham (Regional Bilingual Resource Network) has been attended by ENL  teachers.  Information regarding RBRN training and PDs sponsored by DELLS , Queens North Field Support Center, UFT and  DELLSS on ELL topics are also shared with APs of Supervision.  AP Lavache, ENL/LOTE Department, regularly meets with  content area teachers as well as ENL teachers to supply additional resources and materials.   ENL teachers receive training  twice a month during Monday Department PD meetings.    .       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  All In-House PDs and teacher conferences/training have agendas and sign-in sheets that are kept by AP Lavache.  Teachers  attending external PDs are required to provide an agenda and/or materials from that PD.  ENL teachers are participating in 4  SIOP training sessions and in-class coaching.  Bilingual teachers have participated in a PD training with the ENL/LOTE AP and  are scheduled to participate in at least 1 SIOP training.  RBRN consultant has participated in an ENL co-integrated class Walk- Through and debriefing/training session with 1 ENL teacher (Ms. Fasolakis) and will return to the school in January to conduct  additional class visits.  ENL teachers participate twice a month in ENL/LOTE Department PDs.  Additional in-house PDs will be offered during PD Mondays, afterschool and on Chancellor Day PDs.  ENL, Bilingual and co- integrated teachers have or will participate in at least one SIOP training.            Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   ALL ELL parents or guardians are invited to attend an individual ELL Parent Conference to discuss his/her child's academic and  language progress as well as explain/review the graduation requirements.  The documents shared with parents have been  translated into native languages.  During the meetings the parent is given a copy of the student's transcript.  Invitations in the  parent's native language are mailed as well as a phone message is sent in three native languages (English, Spanish and  Chinese).    If a staff member is not available who speaks the parent's native language, the Over-the-phone Interpretation and  Translation services is used.  This service is now offered 24 hours a day.   Bilingual Spanish guidance counselors (Ms. Fabre and  Ms. Moya) and a Chinese Bilingual social worker (Mr. Changlai) and 1 College and Career Counselor (Mr. Bausone) are available  on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and some Saturdays to also conference with ELL parents.        2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Through the Title III program Flushing High School hosted a Thanksgiving Cultural Celebration and Potluck Feast in November  in collaboration with the Community Based Organizations (CBO) housed in the building as a social-emotional activity to   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      92         celebrate the diversity amongst our students and families.  In December, Flushing High School, in collaboration with CBO New  York Edge is hosting a parent orientation event to introduce the Title III Parent Engagement workshops/excursions.  Parents  will participate in language classes and cultural excursions organized by Title III Parent Engagement Coordinator (Ms.  Solis).  Excursions will include visits to local cultural museums.     The Parent Coordinator (Ms. Vacarr) actively invites ELL parents to participate in PTA meetings and parent  workshops.  Translation equipment is used by staff to translate speeches and discussions in Spanish and ChineseA diverse  group of parents are invited to sit on C-30 committees and have breakfast with the principal.  Parents of ENL/ISS students are  invited to participate in IEP meetings.  Title III Guidance counselors will continue to contact homes to invite parents and to share information about the student's  academic and behavioral progress as well as progress towards meeting the graduation requirements.   In addition, phone messages in Spanish and Chinese were or will be sent regarding announcements about Title III parent  activities.   Letters will also be sent in various native languages as well as direct phone calls by the ENL Coordinator and Title III  staff re:   1) Letters of Entitlement/non-entitlement to students who were tested with NYSITELL to inform parents whether or not their  child was eligible for ESL services.  Only selected students who were tested with NYSITELL.   2) Letters of continuation/transition to inform parents of the results of the NYSESLAT last Spring.  3) Title III registration forms for parents.  4) Flyers to announce parent events classes will be distributed in December announcing the first Title III orientation meeting.o      Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Ignazio Accardi, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      We used the HLIS, ATS reports RLAT and the RPOB to determine the distribution of primary languages spoken by  the parents of our ELLs and of our total population.    Parents fill out a "Blue Card" every year with contact information that includes the preferred language of  communication. This card is stored in the Nurse's office and used in case of emergency. The information is  collected by the pupil accounting secretary, Alexandra Suarez, on intake and updated regularly. All students have  information entered.    2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      96      The Learning Environment Survey asked parents, "Does your school communicate with you in a language that you  understand?" The survey results reflected that 35% strongly agreed and 56% agreed that FHS did.           2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      Per School's Safety Plan: If a parent or visitor does not speak English, the SSA or staff member uses the language chart  to determine the language the individual is speaking, and then attempts to locate a translator within the building by  contacting the main office. If a translator is not present within the building, the SSA or staff member on duty should  escort the individual to the main office, where a school representative should contact the DOE’s Translation and  Interpretation Services Unit at 718 752-7373 to request telephone translation.   In the event of emergencies:   2018-19 RSCEP-PF                      99      School wide message – APO will schedule a phone messenger informing families about the status.

Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      At the beginning of the school year, all staff are informed about the availability of the Over the Phone Interpretation  service. Information regarding the Over the Phone Interpretation is given to staff via email and in-person via flyer  distribution in the main office. Information about Over the Phone Interpretation is also posted throughout the school  in any area where parents have interactions with school staff and personnel.          Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      We will provide each parent with the Parents’ Bill of Rights during monthly PTA meetings, ELL Parent informational  sessions twice a year, Freshmen Academy Parent Informational meetings and Open School Night. Right &  Responsibiliites are also displayed outside the Parent Coordinator’s Office in Spanish and made available to every  parent in the covered languages. In the Parent Coordinator’s Office room 128, there are hard copies of this document  in all the covered languages and they are offered to parents, especially during their first visit to this office.    • We will have printed and posted the signs that are available on the DOE web site to welcome parents to the school,  notifiy them of their rights and responsibilities,and to identify rest room facilities.    • Per Schools’ Safety Plan: If a parent or visitor does not speak English, the SSA or staff member uses the language  chart to determine the language the individual is speaking, and then attempts to locate a translator within the  building by contacting the main office. If a translator is not present within the building, the SSA or staff member on  duty should escort the individual to the main office, where a school representative should contact the DOE’s  Translation and Interpretation Services Unit at 718 752-7373 to request telephone translation.    • Parents are made aware of the NYCDOE web site to obtain translations of documents and provide them to parents  in a timely manner. In addition, all school documents on the Flushing website can be translated by Google Translate  with the link on the web site.    • Spanish is the only language other than English in which there are more than 10% of the parents who speak this  language. Our information posters are in Spanish in and around the Parent Coordinators office.      2018-19 RSCEP-PF  100                              Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       A new Language Acquisition Coordinator will need to be assigned in the fall. This person will have monthly  walkthroughs of the building to ensure that all information is posted properly. The Parent Coordinator is responsible  for interfacing with the Translation Unit for written translations. She will keep a log of each translation that is done.  She will also receive training in what the translation needs of the school are and and will alert the LAC if a documents  are being sent out to parents without the proper translation.          2018-19 RSCEP-PF  101
