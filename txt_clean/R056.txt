This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      We are a collaborative school community that strives to encourage each child to reach his/her maximum potential.  We will do so in a nurturing and caring environment. We will use data from various sources and our knowledge of our  student's abilities to help shape the content and delivery of instruction. Students will be challenged , engaged in  rigorous tasks, participate in discussion and formulate ideas and opinions based on what they read and think  differently than ever before. We also encourage our school community to develop partnerships and life-long learning   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      skills, express creativity, show respect for self and others and to take responsibility for their actions making PS 56 “A  Good Place to Learn & Grow.”         2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   We have an overall enrollment of 576 students. Our demographic breakdown is as follows; 79% White, 15% Hispanic,  4% Asian and 15% Black. Our school has always performed well on NYS exams; however where we fell short in  student Math progress. In (2018) 57% students scored a level 3 or 4 NYS Math exam, which was a decline of of 6%  from 2017 .We are continuing our efforts for improvement on increasing student progress by using formative  assessment to drive instruction. We have also focused on conceptual thinking and providing students with rigorous  Math tasks , as part of their daily routine. We have partnered with Algebra for All, Divide and Conquer and  departmentalized our fifth grade Math and ELA instruction. . We have seen an increase in (2018) Learning  Environment Survey results have showed increases in parent and teacher satisfaction .Funded solely, we look for  creative ways to incorporate AIS for targeted sub-groups. This past year we implemented AIS via SPIRE, Reading  Rescue and RTI for Math and ELA with creative programming. We are looking to expand these services in the coming  years.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.    Our school has always performed well on State Assessments; however where we fall short is student progress,  particularly in our Students with Disabilities (SWD). We have approximately 30% SWD, which is above the city average  and 12% of our population is in Self-Contained. We have a wide -range of disabilities from Physical, to Cognitive to  Social Emotional.    SWD's have a proficiency rate of 25 % level 3 and 4's in Mathematics. SWD's have a proficiency rate of 25% in level 3  and 4's in ELA. Funded solely with FSF, we look for creative ways to incorporate AIS/RTI for targeted sub groups. We  have provided teachers with intervention kits and assistive technology to help students gain access to the  curriculum.This past year, via a grant pilot program, we introduced Reading Rescue, a first grade AIS program. We are  using SPIRE program and training teachers in Orton Gillingham.We are looking for ways to expand this program next  year.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Of the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools , we have made most progress in Rigorous Instruction and  Teacher Collaboration and promoting Strong family-Community Ties. Our Key areas of focus for the 2018-2019 school  year will build and deepen our work in Rigorous Instruction, Teacher Collaboration and Strong Family-Community Ties.  We will continue to build capacity within our faculty and grow our teacher professional learning. We will work on the  strategies and practices to foster increased student ownership of their work and develop more effective feedback to  students and parents. We will expand our development of delivering high-quality instruction focusing on Reading ,  Writing and Mathematics.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 31R056   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   605   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

As per the 2018 school quality report, 100% of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that the principal/school leader at  their school sets high standards for student learning. To develop self-assessed/reflecting learners we all must become  more reflective learners. Staff must feel that they are supported by administration along the way. 75 % of teachers  reported that they have a moderate to great deal of influence over school policy in the area of selecting instructional  materials used in classroom as measured in the school quality report in 2017-18. That number has increased from  65% in 2016-17, however we must continue to improve teacher collaboration. It is our belief that teachers working  alongside with the principal will help set an example of the principal nurturing the professional growth of teachers.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Column B   Verify with an (X)   Section Reference(s)                                 Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local   N/A     N/A     N/A     N/A     N/A        1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33     State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34           Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 56, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      P.S. 56 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students        providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level,   e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology;     providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and      decision making in support of the education of their children;  fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress;     providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;     sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and  in languages that parents can understand;     providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and  other members of the school community;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36         The school’s Parent Involvement   Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.      In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent-Teacher Association, as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on  the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input. To increase  and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:      actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s  Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of  the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;     engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated   directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;     ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and      strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the  Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  P.S. 56 uses a variety of assessments including DRA-2 and Teacher created assessments to assess early literacy skills of our  ELLs.  This data provides insight into ELLs reading, speaking, writing and listening levels. Data has shown that writing is an area  of weakness for our ELLs.  Teacher-created writing lessons are formed to target specific skills as needed.  Writing pieces are  assessed monthly with the NYSESLAT Rubric to determine growth and to identify areas that need improvement.  Areas that  need improvement will have lessons tailored to meet these need and develop next steps.    For math P.S. 56 uses the item skills analysis from the previous school year to target instruction for ELLs. In addition, formative  assessments such as baseline/benchmark assessment, unit exams and mid-chapter check-up's tests are used to assess ELLs ELA  and Math skills to form small groups and target instruction as needed to master concepts. Our data has shown that most ELLs  are stronger in Math skills than ELA. This data helps inform our school’s instructional plan by determining if the students are  on grade level or if they need remediation to reach grade level.  If a student is below grade level they will participate in small   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43      groups with skill based lessons until they master the skills needed to reach grade level. Furthermore, formative assessment  data aids in developing trends in student learning to drive instruction.         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The teachers create spread sheets of the DRA-2 levels for all students, including ELLs to monitor progress.  In addition teachers  record what skills the student needs to improve upon. For example if a student continuously miscues in reading because they  omit the endings off of words then planning may focus around lessons on suffixes and reading strategies to read words the  whole way through. This skill becomes a target for instruction for that student/ and or group of students. Progress is tracked  and noted when mastered. This data analyzed and shared between the classroom teachers, ENL teachers, and service  providers to maximize language needs and drive instruction and aids in students attaining their goals.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Success of programs for ELLs is evaluated by formal and informal assessment. Writing pieces and reading levels are used to  informally assess student growth.  The NYSESLAT modality breakdown is used to determine if a program is successful.  If a  student is lacking in a particular modality the program may need more instruction and practice in that area.  This is when the  teacher and ENL teacher use ENL teaching strategies and incorporate other instructional materials to aid in the students  success. Our data has shown that writing is in area of need for most ELLs; therefore, writing has become a focus goal for the  school year.   In the past P.S.56 has not has a large population of ELLs in grades 3-5 to analyze data for ELLs.  With recent  changes to our ELL population, going forward we plan to use the ELL Periodic Assessment as a summative assessment.    In addition, the Math Item skills analysis from the NY State Math Test is used to measure growth or lack there of in  mathematics.  P.S. 56's School Implementation Team (S.I.T) analyzes the data, targets students as well as standards, and  shares the students names and areas of need with the teachers.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once summative data is gathered, analysis is conducted to determine which areas the students need to improve in. Upon  determination of skills; the instruction is tailored to the students needs.This data is shared with the classroom teacher and  service providers to maximize gains.Data is maintained in the teachers assessment binders. For example, the data from the NY  State Item skills analysis has shown that students, including ELLs and SWDs, needed extra support in various math skills,  particularly math problems focusing on fractions. The team then provided extra support and resources to these teachers to aid  in improving their students in these targeted math skills.  Extra support materials were also sent home for parents to review  and aid in their students learning.  In addition these students were targeted and given the option to attend an after school  math test prep program, housed as P.S. 56 and to receive AIS services for Math during the school day.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   RTI is reviewed and implemented by P.S.56’s School Implementation Team (S.I.T).  The team is comprised of an administrator,  classroom teachers when applicable, ENL Teacher/Literacy Specialist, IEP/Special Education Liaison, School Counselor, School  Psychologist, School Social Worker, and O.T. The administrator provides time, organizational structures, materials and  assessments as needed.  The team collaboratively analyzes data, problem solves, and plans.  They communicate data and  solutions to teachers and organize professional development as needed to teachers and parents.  The team continuously  analyses formative and summative data in, develops trends, identifies students in need of improvement, develops plans,  provides support to implement the plans, and monitors progress.  This team meets and monitors students’ progress bi- weekly.   In addition, P.S. 56 is using Reading Rescue and expanding the use of Orton-Gillingham through several trained staff  members.  Intervention embedded in ReadyGen curriculum in grades K-5 is also used.  ReadyGen has an RTI identification  component built into the assessments.  These assessments determine grouping.  The groups are formed based on which  students did not master the lesson and which students mastered the lesson.   For students who need RTI beyond the  classroom interventions, AIS is offered for ELA and/or Math.  The students are selected by the classroom teacher and/or S.I.T.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44         after reviewing data that indicates the student is struggling in a particular area. RTI strategies are used to provide the building  blocks needed to master the skills and lesson, as well as, provides enrichment to the students who have mastered the lesson.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].    NYSITEL or  NYSESLAT.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   ENLs modality breakdown and EDAT results from the NYSESLAT are kept in the ENL binder and are analyzed for trends and  shared with the classroom teachers, service providers and administration.  This data is used to drive instruction by identifying  areas of improvement and measure growth.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   ENL services are provided as a combination of integrated and stand-alone services determined by the NYSESLAT  proficiency levels stated in CR Part 154.2-3.  An integrated model in various ways dependent on the students  proficiency level.   Entering students receive 360 minutes of ENL instruction weekly; 180 minutes is stand-alone  instruction and 180 minutes is integrated instruction. Emerging ELLs receive 360 minutes of ENL instruction weekly  which is comprised of 90 minutes of stand alone instruction, 180 minutes of integrated instruction and with 90 or  stand-alone/integrated instruction based on the students needs.  ELL students whom are transitioning receive 180  minutes of ENL instruction weekly; 90 minutes of the instruction is integrated and 90 is either stand alone or  integrated based on the students needs.  Expanding ELLs receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL instruction weekly.  Commanding ELLs receive 90 minutes of ENL integrated instruction weekly for an additional two years after they pass  the NYSESLAT.    The ENL Coordinator works closely with administration at the end of the school year to ensure that ELLs are placed in  their grade appropriate general education classrooms together or the appropriate setting if they have IEP's.  ELLs are  heterogeneously grouped in each grade. The ELLs are then serviced within the classroom during the ELA black when  integrated instruction is needed.  When ELLs receive stand-alone instruction they are serviced either individually as  needed or in a group with ELLs on their grade level or one grade below or one grade above their grade based on their  levels.     As discussed above, integrated/stand-alone services are provided by certified English as a New Language  teacher.  These teachers are certified trained teachers who provides instruction in English using ENL methodologies  and scaffolding. In order to maximize English acquisition for the ELL’s, the ENL teachers, and classroom teachers  coordinate their efforts during ELA blocks.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?         The ENL teachers create a schedule based on the ELLs English proficiency levels and mandated number of minutes.  This  schedule is jointly created with the classroom teacher to ensure instruction is being delivered during the ELA blocks. This  schedule is then shared with the classroom teacher and administration for final review.  Moreover, this schedule is entered in  STARS to ensure all students are being serviced.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   P.S. 56 has a Free Standing English as a New Language Program, therefore,  content is delivered in English.  ELLs are given  bilingual glossaries to support content areas in their native language.  Content areas such as social studies and science are  incorporated into literacy.  Teachers often collaborate to teach units to develop a cohesive learning environment for students  and increase their depth of knowledge.  The ENL teacher reinforces content with the students through the use of visual aids,  vocabulary, manipulatives, and additional materials as needed.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      ELLs are usually evaluated in English; however, ELLs are evaluated in their Native Language for the New York State Math  assessment if they choose not to take the Assessment in English.  In addition, Spanish speaking ELLs are evaluated using the  Spanish Lab-R if they scores below the English Lab-R cut score.        5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status     Differentiating instruction for ELL subgroups is vital in their learning.    a. At registration a trained pedagogue will administer the SIFE oral interview Questionnaire.  This will be administered in  English and the student’s home language.  If the questionnaire indicates the student is a potential SIFE then the school  administers the multilingual literacy SIFE screener in the students home language, which will indicate the students’ academic  and assessment history, and provide work samples.  These are reviewed to determine is the child is a SIFE.  If it is found the  student is a SIFE then the writing screener is administered.  This writing assessment will determine the student’s basic writing  skills in their home language.  These assessments are shared with the classroom teacher, cluster teachers, and service  providers to target the student’s needs. SIFE students are closely assessed to identify where the gaps in there learning  are.  SIFE students are taught the CCLS according to their grade and English proficiency.  Lessons are modified for them.    b. New comers that have been in a U.S. school less than three years are taught the CCLS and it is modified to their English  proficiency.   Newcomers that are entering will receive 360 minutes of intense ELA instruction with stand alone and integrated  ENL services, starting with speaking and listening skills and building to reading and writing skills.  c. Developing ELLs at Emerging and Transitioning levels need to be monitored closely.  Emerging Levels will receive 360  minutes of ENL instruction with stand alone and integrated programming to meet their speaking, listening, reading and writing  needs.  In addition these students may be candidates for mediation such as the Response to intervention (RTI) model.  They  should be assessed often to identify areas of growth and areas to be improved.  Lessons aligned to the CCLS build from the  information they have not mastered.  d. Long-term ELLs need to be monitored closely and may be candidates for mediation such as the Response to intervention  (RTI) model.  These students may be bilingually evaluated to determine if language or a disability is impeding their ability to  reach English proficiency.  If the student has an IEP, the differentiation is based on the student’s goals. The student should be  assessed often and lessons should build from the information they have not mastered aligned to the CCLS within their IEP  goals.  Lessons also scaffold to support students and maintain their language strategies for reading, writing, listening, and  speaking.  The lessons are modified for the student to better understand grade level and complex texts.  e. Former ELLs whom are at the commanding level will receive ENL integrated services for 90 minutes a week during ELA or   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      Core Content Areas.  These ELLs still receive ENL test modifications as well as additional ENL support for two years after  passing the NYSESLAT.  They are also monitored closely by their classroom teacher, the ENL teacher is always available to offer  extra support to former ELLs when needed.  Former ELLs are often placed in a classroom with current ELLs, so the ENL teacher  is easily accessible to them within an integrated.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   PS 56 is now using the core curriculum materials provided by the DOE.  ReadyGen and GoMath are programs that allow  teachers to use multiple entry points for all students including ELLs and SWDs.  Teachers of grades K-2 use reading rescue,  foundations, as well as PAF. Teachers of grades 3-5 use reading streets spelling and grammar books.  Within these programs the teacher scaffolds instruction for ELLs in step-by-step instruction. Visual aids are used when needed  to enhance instruction. Teachers also use teacher created materials and additional resources and all staff, teachers and paras  engage in professional development and Professional Learning Communities to improve delivery of instruction to all students.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Various instructional materials are used to support ELLs.  ELLs are exposed to materials such as visual aids, glossaries, and  books aligned to their level. Programs such as, ReadyGen and Gomath have an ELL component built in for ELLs. Furthermore,  technology is used through Smart boards with computer based interactive lessons for literacy, math, science and social  studies.  In addition to the use of smart boards, computers are used by students when attending a technology cluster.  E-chalk  is always a viable resource for ELLs to access school information in their home language.  PS 56 is committed to flexible  programming for students with special needs services. They provided services in such a way to maintain instructional rigor and  providing low-risk environments for all students to work toward their goals.  Schedule is individualized as per students IEP's  and needs.  For example a student whom is in an 12:1 classroom may also receive services in a ICT setting for ideas they are  excelling in such as ELA and/or Math.  All service providers work very closely with each other and the teachers to ensure each  students program is developed with their goals and language acquisition in mind.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Our targeted intervention program continues to follow an RTI model.  GoMath and ReadyGen have tier one, two, and three  student intervention books to use with the students that did not master the skill in the lesson.  Students are frequently  assessed before, during and after lessons and units to monitor student progress.  Some students attend SETSS for intervention  in ELA and Math in a small groups to master the skills they need.   Students programs are adjusted as needed to accommodate  their learning needs.  In addition, targeted interventions are used in grades K-5 to include SPIRE, Reading Rescue, Fundations,  and STEM.  Currently, P.S. 56 only has a English as A New Language program; therefore English is language intervention is  offered.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Based on the data and trends our NYS Math assessment showed a decrease in the past; therefore, we are rolling out a STEM  program for the 2017-2018 school year. In addition, we are adding more PD and PLC's to build capacity, specifically with ELL  and special education teachers, to collaborate with general, as well as service providers to incorporate various strategies. In  addition, our schools underwent a technology upgrade which included Promethean boards that will allow ELLs to engage more  with technology.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A We do not have a Bilingual Program at this time.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are part of our school community and have equal access to any and all curriculum, programs and services that are offered  at PS 56.   At this time P.S. 56 does not have any before school activities.  Our After School program is COMPASS; COMPASS is   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      open to all students including ELLs. In addition P.S.56 offers after school programs such as Kids are Cooking, Art Club, Wizards  of Art, 9/11 Flag Football, Bricks for Kids, Theater Art Club and the District 31 Children's Parade which our theater Club attends.  Test prep for ELA and Math are also offered. The School Leadership teams such as SIT and PPT ensure ELLs attend and have  access to all programs.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Various instructional materials are used to support ELLs.  ELLs are exposed to materials such as visual aids, glossaries, books  aligned to their levels, books in their native language, with the aid of technology when necessary.  ReadyGen and GoMath have  a component built in for ELLs that targets ELL instruction.  Technology is used through newly installed Promethean Boards with  computer based interactive lessons for literacy, math, science and social studies.  In addition to the use of Promethean boards,  computers are used by students when attending a technology cluster. Interactive English games are used at target instruction  for entering and emerging ELLs to increase listening, speaking, reading, and writing activities.  Leveled E-Books are a great  resource to target instruction for ELLs of all subgroups.  Furthermore, E-chalk is always a viable resource for ELLs to access  school information in their home language.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   P.S. 56 only has an English as a New Language (ENL) program at this time due to low enrollment.  Home language support is  delivered in our ENL program by the use of content area glossaries and bilingual dictionaries and libraries.  In addition books  and E-books are provided in the student’s home language to support literacy in school and at home.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.   All service providers and classroom teachers collaborate to best support all ELLs.  Often classroom teachers and service  providers will share materials to reinforce a lesson through different points of entry.   Materials such as math manipulatives,  visual aids, bilingual glossaries, translated books, vocabulary guides, and bilingual E-books are used for ELLs in both the general  education, ICT and special education classrooms as needed. All teachers of ELLs are aware of the age, grade level, and  language proficiency, so they can best assist students in reaching language proficiency and IEP goals.        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    At this time our school does not share a building.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Newly enrolled ELL students meet with the ENL teacher at registration.  An informal interview is conducted as well as  assistance in filling out the home language survey.  Parent of NYSITELL eligible ELLs will be informed that their child will be  tested for ENL services and results will be sent home with their child within the first 10 days of school.

Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication.

Throughout the school year all parents of all new students are surveyed at point of registration into the school to  ascertain which language they would prefer to receive Documentation and what language they would like to  communicate with school staff. ‘Interpretation Services Available’ signs are visible in the main office in several  languages informing parents that translation is available if needed. In addition, administration and parent  coordinator reach out to the parents upon entry. Parent workshops are made available for all parents.  Accommodations for the parents whose HL is other than English are always provided and implemented. Parent  language preferences are also recorded on the back of the HLIS and entered into ATS. This information is accessed  by the RCPL report in ATS. This report is then used to create an Excel spread sheet of parents preferred language,  which is distributed to all staff.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54     2.
