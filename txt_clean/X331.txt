Background  Rise Schools have demonstrated:   ●   ●   they have the will and conditions in place to accelerate student growth and meet school improvement  benchmarks.  they have the capacity to lead/implement a school improvement strategy.   Rise Schools have seen some gains1 across multiple measures including graduation rates, college readiness, state  test scores and attendance. As a result, these schools will fully transition out of the Renewal Schools program at  the end of the 2017-2018 SY and continue under the guidance of the Office of Field Support, in partnership with  the Office of School Support and Supervision.    1All Rise Schools met at least 67% of their benchmarks, are not on the State’s Priority list, and have demonstrated a  sustainable school improvement structure that will allow them to build on their progress.    Six Rise Keys for Continued Improvement         1.  Strengthen the Instructional Core   2.  Strengthen Instructional Leadership Capacity   3.  4.  Apply a tiered approach to student intervention  5.  Promote a positive, inclusive school environment for students, staff, parents and   Improve Data Driven Practices   community partners  Increase monitoring and accountability   6.     Theory of Action  If the NYC Department of Education provides customized supports to Rise schools and principals designed around the  “Six Rise School Keys for continued improvement” then, Rise principals and their teams will have the tools and resources  to accelerate outcomes for ALL students and increase students’ access to an excellent and equitable education.    Structure of the Rise School Comprehensive Educational Plan (R-CEP)   The Rise School Comprehensive Educational Plan (R-CEP) will serve as the organizing and overarching document for each  Rise school and will be directly aligned and developed around the elements of the Framework for Great Schools, New  York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, and Strong Schools, Strong  Communities, including the following:   ●  Rise Benchmarks: please refer to the 2018-19 Rise benchmarks provided to your school.  ●  Establishing an overarching summative vision aligned with elements of the Framework for Great Schools and  documenting key areas of celebration and Rise through analysis of assessments and by envisioning what the  desired outcome for each school will be at the end of the School Rise process.    ●  Setting mid-year point benchmarks that create the path for improvement by focusing on desired outcomes and  goals. In this way, the plan will be mapped to the overarching summative vision. In addition to the five discrete  goals formed around the elements of the Framework for Great Schools, each school will create an action plan.  ●  Transformation into a community school in order to increase student and family access to physical and mental   health services and other social-emotional supports made available in or near the school.   ●  Expanded learning opportunities for all students, including additional instruction provided during afterschool   and/or summer programming provided in collaboration with community partners.   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          5         ●   Intensive professional development for all staff to ensure effective implementation of curriculum and  instruction aligned to the Next Generation Learning Standards (NGLS) and to support staff in effectively  responding to the differentiated academic and social-emotional needs of all students.   ●  Additional, focused strategies to increase parent and family engagement.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Information on the Framework for Great Schools and the DTSDE   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.     The Framework for Great Schools and the R-CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Rise School Comprehensive  Educational Plan (R-CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for  continuous improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review  and analysis of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities  and strategies that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.   In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.     2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          6         The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools      In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets, the American Institute of Research (AIR) Needs Assessment, the  NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative and qualitative data.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools – they call it a Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement.  All Priority and Focus Schools and Focus   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          7     Districts must use the new tool; and districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Education Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement         NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   I.  Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:     a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          8   a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)         It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the R-CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the R-CEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.     Next Steps for R-CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists in every Rise school and   meets all the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the American Institute of Research (AIR) needs   assessment, the school’s updated NYSED accountability status and most current quantitative and qualitative  data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Rise Key and the corresponding statement of   Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an  Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select  their SOPs. Schools that did not undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major  findings/recommendations from your most recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other  qualitative and quantitative data.       Step 4: Discuss and respond to the guiding questions under each Framework element.     Step 5: Revisit your school’s current goals, and strategically create new goals informed by the needs   assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART – Specific,  Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you monitor  progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you have identified, and will let your school  community know when you have reached your goal.     Step 6: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 7: Update your school’s AIS section. Title I schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement   Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 8: Complete the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) and the Community School sections.     Step 9: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether strategies and activities outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust practices along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Rise Program Priorities    Our Rise Theory of Action (page 4) is drawn from research1 on turnaround schools, the DOE Framework for Great  Schools, DTSDE Tenets, and the Quality Review, which suggest that these key priorities have the greatest impact on  student achievement.     2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          9         RISE Keys   Priorities      1.

Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including your school’s mission statement and a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or  special initiatives being implemented.   Identify any special student populations that the school has and what their specific needs are.   2.  3.  Describe your school’s approach to family engagement and progress made with establishing families as   partners in furthering student achievement    4.  Describe how your school is leveraging community school partnerships to support progress in elements of the   Framework for Great Schools and your Rise Benchmarks and indicate where this has been a challenge.   5.  Summarize the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) opportunities that have been offered to your students this year.      The Bronx School of Young Leaders/MS 331 is a special place. Visitors regularly comment on how positive it is and its  “good energy”. We are very proud of that because our mission is, “Educating people to enjoy and improve the world”.  We believe that learning should be an enjoyable experience and that if our students experience learning as joyful they  will want to continue learning and really be life-long learners. The focus on ‘joy’ and ‘improvement’ in our mission  statement is connected to our school vision statement, “I believe we can create a high performing school, despite  being in a high poverty neighborhood, which respects the families and traditions of our students. I believe we can  show other urban schools that students living in poverty are capable of rigorous thinking as evidenced in their  discourse, problem-solving and decision-making and do not need to be controlled by low-level curriculum and  instruction. I believe we can create a school with structures in place that demonstrate and teach students to value  effort, choice and freedom, rather than embed an ideology of dependence and a fixed notion of intelligence. I believe  we can create a school of young leaders who have the self-efficacy to recognize that they are in charge of their  destiny and the willingness and ability to overcome injustices to realize their dreams. I believe we can create the  conditions for students to recognize learning as an enjoyable experience and to feel empowered to improve their  world. “      When we changed our name to “Young Leaders,” we created partnerships to help provide opportunities for  leadership, in addition to changes we made in classroom instruction that would allow classrooms to be more  “student-led”. Fordham University is our key partnership and this Community Based Organization (CBO), is housed on  our campus. They are assisting us with providing medical and psychological services on-site as well as providing  numerous student and family supports and enrichments. In addition, they are helping us with our "College for All"  initiatives including, assisting us with High School and College visits and fairs, “Networking Nights” and "Career Fairs"  where students have the opportunity to practice Networking and learn about various professions, and practice  interviews with students who are applying to specialized programs. A key student decision-making body in the school  is our Student Council. They meet regularly with our Youth Services Team to plan events and make decisions for the  school. Some of their members are also serving on our School Leadership Team (SLT).      Seven years ago, we began working with Fordham University, and four years ago the Collaborative Teachers Project,  as part of a long-term teacher recruitment plan. They send student teachers and we pair them up with some of our  most effective teachers for training. We spend a lot of time and effort on their development while they are here with  us student teaching and we have been able to hire some incredible teachers through this plan.       2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          14      Another partnership we have is with CUNY-NYSEIB . Our leadership team spent a year working in collaboration with  key researchers and writers of translanguaging programs to write an action plan specific to the needs of our emerging  bilingual population. Now, we have developed an “Emerging Bilingual Team”, consisting of teachers , CUNY and  Fordham staff, and administrators, that focuses on instructional development and emerging bilingual students’  academic achievement and social emotional development.      Morris Heights is a community partner of ours. We have a health clinic in our building as well as mental health  services, both staffed by Morris Heights. The two social workers are members of our Student Intervention Team and  meets weekly with us as we discuss our most at-risk students. The health clinic provides many services to our  students, including physicals, injury response, preventative counseling, vision screening/eyeglasses and  immunizations. They also refer students to the clinic in our neighborhood.      Based upon our 2016-2017 School Quality Snapshot, our school’s strength is our Supportive Environment, where we  scored an "Excellent". In Rigorous Instruction, Collaborative Teachers, Effective School Leadership, Family Community  Ties, Trust and Student Achievement we scored "Good" Our student attendance rate is 95% and our staff attendance  rate is 97%. We have 20% English Language Learners and 25% Students with Disabilities. Our Students with Special  Needs scored in the ‘excellent’ category in ELA and "Good" in math, this is up from the previous year where our  overall rating was 'fair' for both subjects. Emerging Bilingual Learners (EBL) also scored 'excellent' on ELA and 'Good'  on Math. This is also up from 'Good' and 'Fair' respectively. Progress on state tests is an area we performed well on in  general. ‘All students’ received an ‘excellent’ for ELA and ‘Good’ for math. Our “lowest performing students” scored  ‘Excellent’ for ELA (up from 'Good' last year) and 'Fair' for math (Up from 'Poor' last year) in terms of growth on state  tests. 82% of students are passing their classes and 85% of our former 8th graders are earning enough high school  credit in 9th grade to be on track for high school graduation (a 2% increase). 13% of our students met math state  standards (level 3 or 4) (a 3% increase) and 22% met state standards (level 3 or 4) on their ELA state tests (a 10%  increase). Our school environment is very positive as indicated on our Learning Environment Survey results; we scored  "Excellent" for Supportive Environment. 89% of parents responded positively to questions about the school. 92% of  students feel the school is providing enough information about the transition to High School. 91% of teachers feel the  school provides time for them to collaborate with colleagues.       Our most recent Quality Review was in April, 2017. We received a ‘well developed’ in 1.1 Curriculum, 1.3 Budget, 1.4  School Culture, 3.4 High Expectations and 4.2 Teacher Teams. We received ‘proficient’ in 1.2 Pedagogy, 2.2  Assessment, 3.1 Goals and Action Plans, 4.1 Teacher Support & Supervision, and 5.1 Monitoring & Revising Systems.  The area of celebration was 1.4 School Culture.       The school offers a broad array of Expanded Learning Time (ELT) opportunities to students. Currently students are  assigned to an extra five hours of instruction per week. The additional time is targeted to student needs, based upon  iReady data. In addition we have Saturday remedial and enrichment classes. We have several extracurricular arts and  sports activities including, creative writing/poetry, music, visual art, dance, theater, choir, varsity and junior varsity  boys and girls basketball, flag football, baseball, soccer, volleyball,and track.                2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          15         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 10X331   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   409   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide,   Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review?      Upon reviewing Tenet 3, we look to further our growth in practice 3.5 with an added focus on 3.3. We plan to use  assessment and analysis more strategically to meet the needs of all students including students with disabilities and  English Language Learners; by working with teachers to develop and incorporate data-driven instruction protocols. A  review of our feedback from several sources, including the Quality Review, PPR, and consultations with staff, indicates  the following strengths and needs.   · Strength: The school has a well-developed curriculum in place (SQR April 2017) that is strongly aligned to the CCLS,  according to the Survey of Enacted Curriculum (SEC) conducted in Spring of 2015. The school also received a ‘Proficient’  during the most recent SQR in April 2017 for Pedagogy. On the 2017-2018 ELA state assessment we moved from 22% to  30% proficiency and on the state math assessment from 13 to 27% proficiency.    · Needs: Develop and implement benchmark assessments, aligned to the CCLS that will allow the school to strategically  plan short and long-term goals, track progress, make instructional and curricular adaptations, and plan small group  and/or individual interventions for all struggling students, including students with disabilities and English Language  Learners. Advance data showed that assessment was the greatest area of need for our teachers. In the written feedback  it is clear that teachers need help with how to use assessment data to quickly make instructional adjustments to meet  the needs of students.    2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          18      · Priority Need: Our 2017 SQR identified providing clear next steps for verbal and written feedback to students.         Part 2 – Summative Vision for Rigorous Instruction   What is your school’s instructional focus? What is your vision for promoting the instructional focus consistently across  classrooms?    Our instructional focus is: "If we know the social/emotional and academic needs of our students then we can work  collaboratively to address them". This is our instructional focus, because of our belief that if we know the standards that  students are supposed to master and we also know their current level of mastery then we can work together to ensure  everyone knows how to create scaffolds and instruction to help bridge the gap between what has been mastered and  what should be mastered. Since we have over 70% of our students not currently mastering ELA and Math standards and  because we have adolescents who need a lot of social/emotional support, especially when growing up in communities  with high levels of trauma and poverty, we know that this is where we can make the most profound improvement. Our  focus on the bridging the "gap" will include specific monitoring of our ENL and SWD in their classrooms as well as in  their intervention groups.          How will you implement a standards-aligned curricula that meets the needs of your diverse learners, including ELLs  and SWDs?  Each unit will end with a summative performance task. Throughout the unit leading up to the task, students will have  received instruction and assessments aligned to the criteria in the performance task and feedback and next steps.  Teachers will use the data from the on-going assessments in a unit to adjust instruction and meet the needs of  individual students. Teachers that service EBL and SWDs spend time planning and refining curriculum on our Curriculum  Fridays (full day department planning sessions) with their colleagues who teach general education, however they focus  on the scaffolds needed for students to master the grade level standards. These planning sessions occur six days per  year. We have a Understanding by Design (UbD) rubric to assess      What is your vision for ensuring that all student have access to rigorous coursework that moves them towards career  and college readiness? How will you support the personal and academic skills, habits, and behaviors needed for  students to be career and college ready?  We are using "Academic Moves for College and Career Readiness: 15 Must-Have Skills Every Student Needs to Achieve"  as our mentor text for next school year. At EOY conferences with teachers they are receiving the book to read over the  summer. We will use the book next year to teach the 15 academic skills as well as to create assessments using the  shared rubric for each skill. We will track the student data on each skill and use the data at department meetings to  discuss implications for instruction.   During the school day, we have opportunities to parallel program many students who need extra help. For example,  some students go to a reading specialist each day.    We are working with an organization, Elevate!, to provide students with several ‘study skills’ workshops. The teachers  then reinforce the same study skills in their classes. High Schools have told us this is a major need when students enroll  in H.S. For the second year in a row, a group of 8th grade students will be enrolled in the NYS Living Environment  Regents course, giving them an opportunity to earn high school credit and pass their first Regents Test toward their high  school diploma. Additionally, this year we will also implement the city-wide "College for All" curriculum in our 7th grade  S.S. classroom. Our instructional vision focuses on students becoming independent readers, writers and develop  respectful discourse skills, all of which prepare students for their futures.            2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          19            How do you envision embedding the elements of culturally responsive instruction and how will you know that  implementation is successful?  Instructional goals should be set based upon the needs of the students and assessment information. During class there  should be evidence that the assessment information was used to plan the lesson. Teachers should be checking for  understanding throughout the lesson and students should be assessing their mastery of the learning goal, throughout  the lesson and at the end of the lesson. Instruction should be relevant to students and we will assess unit plans to  ensure that it is.      What is your vision for the use of a comprehensive assessment strategy (diagnostic, formative, benchmark, and  summative) to drive curricular, instructional, and organizational decisions that impact student outcomes?  We are developing a tool which allows us to track student mastery towards state standards with at least three attempts  per standard. We will hold quarterly data meetings with staff members to review the data and determine if adjustments  to the curriculum, instruction or assessment need to be made. For students receiving Tier 2 and Tier 3 interventions we  are using iReady to determine specific skills that need to be taught and a Multi-Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS) tool  that will be used to track student progress.      How do you envision differentiating teacher professional learning opportunities to support instructional foci, meet  students’ unique needs and advance culturally responsive education in your school?  Some of our professional learning cycles involve the whole staff, such as when we launch the year with a series on  "Teaching with Love and Logic". It is important for coherence that the whole staff is involved. We are able to  differentiate professional learning through our mini-observations, in which each administrator visits 3-5 classrooms per  day, followed by a verbal conversation and a one paragraph written summary of the conversation. We also have a  robust mentoring program, in which assigned staff members, including new teachers, are given a mentor and they have  a clear monthly focus.        Part 3 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools – Rigorous Instruction. Your goal must be consistent with the  expectations in part 2, responsive to the identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART –  Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Meeting your SMART goal should directly impact  meeting at least one of your Rise Benchmarks.

Based upon our Middle School Quality Snapshot:   · 90% of students feel we offer variety in classes and programs in school and afterschool   · 82% of students report feeling safe at school   · 97% of parents are satisfied with the education that their child has received   · 86% of teachers would recommend this school to parents and   · 70% of students say that most students at the school treat each other with respect which is 13% higher than the NYC  average.   According to our Learning Environment Survey:   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          24      · Parents are 95% satisfied with school culture, while teachers are 90%, and students reported 85%.   Our attendance rate for the 2016 – 2017 school year was 95.4% while teacher attendance was 97%.   We have many community partners at this school including:   · 46 th Precinct Youth Division   · Dreamyard   · St. Judes Children Hospital   · Wheelchairs Against Guns   · Fordham University   · Morris Heights Health Center   We have many human resources to support the social and emotional development of our students. We have two  guidance counselors and two deans. We also have a parent coordinator and community associate who work closely with  CBO’s, staff, parents, and students.   Overarching systems that are in place to sustain social and emotional developmental health include:   · Student Intervention Team   · Teacher Teams addressing specific student intervention needs across a grade   · Youth Services Team   · School Based Support Team   · Special Education Implementation Team   · Emerging Bi-lingual Team   · Campus Safety Team   · Building Response Team   * MTSS Team   There are several extracurricular activities taking place before and after school as well as on Saturdays. There are  opportunities for visual arts, acting, dance, technology, and music during the school day as well as in after-school.   Our school teaches and reinforces core character values called PRIDE: Professionalism, Respectful, Integrity,  Determination and Empathy. We have daily goals aligned to PRIDE and our mornings announcers discuss PRIDE each  day. Daily, a section sheet will travel with a class in order to notice who is showing, or not showing PRIDE in their classes.  This provides data collection informing appropriate follow up action.   NEEDS   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          25      In our efforts to consistently align our character education program across the school both from 6 th to 8 th grade as well  as across a grade team, it is necessary for us to be explicit in what PRIDE looks like in the classroom, throughout a  lesson, and in other areas and capacities within the school. The goal is to reinforce these characteristics so that students  internalize them and generalize these abilities into other areas of their life outside and beyond schooling. A committee  began meeting in the Spring of 2015 to develop curriculum for “The First 30 days of school”. This curriculum includes  specific goals and lesson plans that will be taught to all students regarding common character traits we want to teach as  well as our norms of operation in the school. The language of PRIDE will be aligned to our progressive discipline system.  Additionally, it is necessary to consistently teach and model these values while reinforcing them using PBIS methods.   Teachers and other staff members participated in a professional learning cycle in SY 2015-2016 on using the strategies in  the book, Teaching with Love and Logic. We still need further professional development on social emotional learning,  executive functioning skills and the impact of trauma on students. We have student intervention protocols in place on a  weekly basis and it is our goal to be clear and consistent in our communication in how all stakeholders can intervene.  The goal is to ensure that all interventions take on a positive light. We will use dedicated PD time to teach teachers  strategies, tools, context, and implementation of character education in support of social emotional developmental and  academic success. Teacher teams will hold each other accountable to these initiatives through formalized inter- visitations and team protocols to monitor their own progress. We must utilize data in a systematic way to establish  overarching systems that promote a vision for social and emotional developmental health that is aligned to a  curriculum, as well as to develop a common understanding of the importance of the contributions of all stakeholders in  creating a school community that is safe and supportive. We will work together to establish structures to support the  use of data to respond to student social and emotional developmental health needs. Data will be collected and analyzed  in order to monitor school’s progress in continuing to make The Bronx School of Young Leaders a safe and supportive  environment.      Priority Need: Upon reviewing Tenet 5.2 and 5.4 we will continue our work to develop a common understanding of  adolescent social-emotional health and reinforce our systems that support data collection on student progress on this  curriculum so that we can positively reinforce behaviors with a school-wide PBIS system.         Part 2 – Summative Vision for Supportive Environment   What is your vision for a supportive school environment? How will you, in partnership with each CBO and families,  enact your vision?  We want everyone visiting to continue to comment on the ‘joy’ that is felt and the alignment of the culture of the school  to our mission, “Educating people to enjoy and improve the world.” Our vision is that they will also be able to say that  we have an environment that supports ‘high achievement’ even if we are in a ‘high poverty’ area and that all  stakeholders care so much that we have overcome external obstacles. We are excited about the resources our CBO,  Fordham University, are bringing to support the environment of our school. We will have a full-time social worker to  assist our guidance department with addressing the many social and emotional needs of our students. We will also have  a SAPIS worker assigned through Central. We plan to continue to keep structures, such as our Student Intervention  Team (SIT), in place so that we can bring all of the key staff members who service students who are most at-risk  together each week. We will have weekly sessions during professional periods on the topics of executive functioning,  childhood trauma and the social and emotional needs of our students and ensuring our further understanding of how to  work with students in this age group. We believe that we have to build the capacity of our teachers to respond to the  needs of the students. In addition to continuing to build our own understanding, we plan to have Tier 1 -3 MTSS in place  including creating a team-building atmosphere for each homeroom by having students earn “Pride dollars” for their  homeroom and having incentives aligned to the ‘dollars’. We implemented this PBIS system in SY 2015-2016 and it  proved effective. Students that are in self-contained classrooms will be integrated into homerooms for the first 15  minutes of each day and will be included in school-wide events as part of a larger homeroom. All teachers will be taught  to use Move This World and Brain Powered Classroom techniques in their classroom as part of our strategy to off-set  the impact of trauma that so many of our students have experienced or are experiencing.       2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          26        Describe your plan to implement a culture of trust and high expectations for teachers, students, families and  community partners.  We believe that you build trust through your actions. Teachers, students, families and community partners have to see  leadership that acts with integrity. We have to be good listeners and have a clear message of our vision that sets high  expectations for all.            Who are your CBO partners?

The social worker will offer both group and individual counseling to students and families. We offer Saturday wellness  programs to our families and students and family members attend together. We have many programs and workshops  for families including ESL, computer classes, nutrition and citizenship. We offer weekly distributions of healthy  vegetables that are locally grown. Each year we hold a Community Forum and ask the families to give us feedback on a  number of topics.         What essential questions, or key themes, will be explored by all staff and students that acknowledge and celebrate the  culture and heritage of the student body?  Our Social Studies curriculum is from National Geographic and is called World Geography and Culture. Students in 6th  and 7th grade study every region of the world and learn about the geography, history and culture of the people living in  that area. We hold an annual Cultural Extravaganza which is one of our best attended events, in which we celebrate the  dress, food, traditions of many cultures from around the world. We incorporate sign language in our daily instruction.  We work to create a multilingual ecology by using the home languages of our children in our lessons each day.

What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide,   Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review?      According to the April 2017 Quality Review, teacher teams are well-developed at the school. Teachers all have access to  a rich supply of data in the New Visions Data Sorter. The school has held Student Led Conferences for six years and will  continue to do so this year. At Student Led Conferences, students inform their parents about their progress toward  mastering the learning goals and engage their families as partners in assisting them with success in school. We will also  incorporate our learning from taking part in Academic Parent Teacher Teams (APTT) to include parents as key partners  in improving academic achievement.    According to student surveys and formative assessments, the primary reason that many students are unable to engage  with the content being presented or topic being assessed is that they are unfamiliar with academic vocabulary. In order  to ensure that all students are able to access the rigorous content being presented, we will work across all departments  to ensure that we make academic vocabulary accessible.      Priority Need: Now that we have a data in the data sorter that allows us to see 'big picture' data, we need an instrument  that allows us to focus on specific skills, aligned to standards, that allows us to look at unit by unit data. We are piloting  a tool we designed during summer school of this year and will continue to collaborate to refine the tool for the next   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          32      school year. Teachers will use the tool to look at student data and collaborate together to plan instruction based on the  data.         Part 2 – Summative Vision for Collaborative Teachers   What is your vision for collaborative teaching?        Teachers “are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and the school. They have the  opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement.”  Teachers work on grade teams during professional periods four times per week. Teachers also work in department  meetings, every Monday and every 5 weeks for a full day. During these department meetings teachers review each  other’s units, use protocols for looking at student work and performance tasks, engage in discourse around current  pedagogical practices, and debrief inter-visitations. Many teachers have opportunities for leadership through positions  as grade team leaders, facilitators of team meetings regarding IEPs and in their departments. Teachers and students are  very comfortable with administrators, coaches and peers visiting their classrooms regularly.   Many structures are in place which allow for teachers to share a common language and collaborate. There is a specific  unit and lesson plan template that allows for teachers to share a common language around planning. There are several  school-wide instructional practices which are consistent across grades and departments (use of quick-writes, cold- calling, annotation symbols, hand signals and think-pair-share protocols). Departments have developed common rubrics  for use with specific performance tasks. Finally, the school has been using the Danielson Framework for Teaching for  nine years. This has created an over-all common language regarding planning, environment, instruction and professional  responsibilities. Teachers have developed common teaching practices and are beginning the use of writing and reading  rubrics to align assessment through grades level courses and school wide.    Teachers use a common community building behavioral system called PRIDE. This allows students and teachers to use  common language and structure in homeroom, daily lessons, and during school wide activities.   As we expand our special education department, our Special Education Supervisor will offer PD on areas specific to  special education including Integrated Co-Teaching Techniques, modifications, adaptations, Behavior Improvement  Plans, and the use of paraprofessionals in the classroom.   All departments will work on building common keywords, through implementation of "Marzano's Six Step Process For  Building Academic Vocabulary." Departments will meet and decide which vocabulary words will be reinforced grade- wide, and hold pre- and post-assessments to monitor student learning.   ELA teachers will collaborate around our new independent reading initiative, modeled on the work of the Showcase  School: East Side High School. The three grades will share common lessons, assessments, structures which will build a  love of reading with our students and allow them to be more proficient readers.       The use of a Google Forms tracker for IEP’s will continue to be used for instructional alignment and progress monitoring.   This year, we will continue to use the Data Wise Improvement Process to address learner centered problems and  instructional problems of practice.             2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          33                 How do you envision enhancing collaboration amongst your Instructional Leadership Team to improve teacher  practices and student learning?

How do you use this process to  determine which intervention to provide?  We will use the iReady Instructional Grouping Reports to identify which students need extra help. Students will be  assigned quarterly intervention periods based upon the specific skills with which they need support.         Part 3 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools – Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be consistent with the  expectations in part 2, responsive to the identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART –  Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Meeting your SMART goal should directly impact  meeting at least one of your Rise Benchmarks.  During the School Year 2018-2019, teachers and students work together at bimonthly focus groups to implement a  program/plan to create a learning environment that is responsive to students’ varied experiences and tailored to the  strengths and needs of all students which will result in meeting the Performance Index Benchmark for ELA (2. 49) and  for math (2.32).

Identify the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this section.   3.  4.  What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide,   Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review?      The leadership has articulated a mission, vision and instructional focus. There is a sense of urgency around our academic  achievement data and the need for instructional shifts to help us improve this data. The system of Instructional Rounds  allows the leadership team to monitor the school’s progress toward the instructional focus. There is also an  understanding of the school’s strengths as articulated by leadership. The Danielson Framework for Teaching has been  utilized for formative and summative purposes over the last eight years. This has created a culture of improvement and  allowed for the development of consistent pedagogical practices. Strategic decisions have been made to build a positive  school culture, including fiscal, human resources and development of structures/systems. The needs of sub-groups have  been identified and systems have been created to address these needs. Success is contingent on the work of all.  Therefore, administrators have developed many structures for distributed leadership. Grade team leaders, who meet  weekly with supervisors, lead weekly grade team meetings. One coach, who is also a teacher has been developed to  lead the Math department. Three teachers have been members of city-wide leadership programs and have gone on to  lead schools in the city. Mentor teachers are key to developing new teachers and recruiting for vacancies at our school  as well as ‘sister’ schools. School leaders use a system of ‘mini-observations’ that occur frequently to provide teachers  with formative feedback. As well, the leaders make frequent summative assessments in teacher classrooms.   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          38      Priority Need: This year we are developing a digital tool to monitor progress of all students toward power standards and  small groups of students progress on prerequisite skill deficits they currently have. This work will be communicated as  part of our overall focus on monitoring our Multi-Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS) academically and behaviorally.         Part 2 – Summative Vision for Effective School Leadership   What is your vision for effective school leadership at your school?      School leaders will launch the school year clearly articulating the school’s vision, mission and goals for the SY 2018-2019,  including the benchmarks established for the RISE program, with all stakeholders. In addition to engaging constituents in  workshops and problem-solving conversations, written communication will archive the short-term and long-term goals  and plans. The CBO/Fordham has become a key partner in our school community and began working, three years ago,  on co-constructing our RISE and Community School plans. Many structures will be in place to ensure that our  partnership with Fordham is strong and moving us toward our goals. Each week a cabinet meeting, including the  Fordham team and the school-based instructional team, will be held to ensure that we are planning, implementing,  monitoring our academic progress throughout the year, and making revisions when necessary. Members of Fordham’s  team will also be on our Student Intervention Team (SIT), which meets weekly to discuss the social and emotional needs  of the school body and individual students. School leaders will perform three Instructional Rounds throughout the year  to ensure that the school is improving and making progress on our Instructional Focus. In addition to the weekly cabinet  and SIT, a weekly budget meeting is held with our budget manager, to ensure that we are utilizing all resources in a  strategic manner. The Principal, APs, and Instructional Coaches (both school-based and Fordham ) will perform daily  ‘mini-observations’ of staff assigned to them. These mini-observations will be between 10 -15 minutes in length and will  be followed by a verbal debrief within 24 hours and a quick written summary of the contents of the debrief  conversation. This will ensure that teachers are receiving timely and actionable feedback which is on-going and  formative. The cabinet meeting will always include an agenda item which allows each member to share what they have  seen in observations, so that school leaders can follow up with the feedback in their evaluative observations. We will  continue to have our Attendance and Youth Service Committees. The Attendance Committee plans incentives,  addresses chronic absenteeism by assigning students Success Mentors, and other attendance issues , and has been  largely responsible for the school’s current 95.4% attendance rating. The Youth Services Team ensures that there are on- going school wide events that create a sense of community, avail students of resources for their social emotional needs  and provide students a voice in school decision making. The leadership, including three model teachers, will develop the  capacity of staff to use the Data wise Improvement Process and the skills in our mentor text for the year (Academic  Moves for College and Career Readiness: 15 Must-Have Skills Every Student Needs to Achieve) in their departments.   This year we are developing a digital tool for monitoring all students' progress toward power standards in ELA and Math  as well as monitor students who are receiving MTSS at Tier 2 and Tier 3 levels on the specific skills they are learning.            What are your core belief(s) for school improvement and how they inform your vision for developing instructional  leadership at your school?  We have created a document which articulating the "Beliefs, values, norms, patterns of behavior and shared artifacts"  our school has formally and informally created over the last 14 years. The "beliefs" include: All children are good, school  should be a place of joy for everyone, relationships matter, our schools can develop the tools they need to overcome  challenges, those doing the reading/writing/discussing/and listening are those doing the learning, we take  responsibility, and we are preparing students to have access to all opportunities." Our "Values" include: Professional-  Teach students to be critical thinkers, collaborative, strong communicators and creative...Respect- be collaborative &  supportive of one another....Integrity- Teach students what is right/correct....Determination- Keep trying until you find a  solution for an individual child....Empathy- Teach independence and self-efficacy over control and compliance.

How will you utilize teacher  leaders to build broad capacity within your school?   Our teacher leaders will have specific teachers that they mentor. They will also have specific teaching benchmarks,  aligned to Danielson, that they will assess and provide feedback on throughout the year. Teacher leaders will also  provide modeling to targeted teachers who visit their classrooms, on specific instructional strategies. They will be part  of developing and leading professional learning cycles.    Grade team leaders facilitate two meetings per week on their grade team. They will lead the professional learning cycle  on our mentor book. Our administrative team meets with the grade team leaders weekly at our Instructional Leadership  Team and discuss and plan for the facilitation of their meetings.      How will the leader foster collaborative school governance processes, and ensure full family participation together  with other stakeholders?  We have very robust teacher leadership in our school. I will continue to support the development of teacher leaders,  through our on-going conversations, Instructional leadership meetings and professional development in the model  teacher program. As well, our School Leadership Team (SLT) holds meetings with family participation and reviews and  makes adjustments to our RSCEP as needed. We held our first ever Community Forum in January 2016, and have held  one every year since. Parents gave us feedback on many different aspects of the school, aligned to the Framework for  Great Schools, and we are implementing many of their suggestions.      How will you use evidence-based systems to ensure school and teacher leaders are led by a cycle of continuous  learning and use this to inform their teams’ priorities?

What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide,   Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review?   Our campus is a very welcoming environment. When you walk in the front door, you will see the flags of the many  countries that our families and staff are from. The building is well maintained and teachers and students create  beautiful displays. At MS 331 we have many family-oriented events. In addition to holding the four mandatory school- wide meetings with families. In October, we have our annual Pink Day Fashion Show, where our entire community is  invited to attend and support the Making Strides campaign and everyone is wearing “Pink” and we release “Pink”  balloons into the air in honor of those who have passed away. We have an annual “Turkey Bowl” the day before  Thanksgiving vacation, a Talent Show the day before Winter Vacation, two ‘Arts Showcases”, a Sports Awards Banquet  and quarterly celebrations of academic achievement. Staff is utilizing the Tuesday Parent Engagement time to create  relationships with the families of their homeroom students. They are called each week and are given progress reports  and specific ways to help their children at home. We hold Student Led Conferences, rather than traditional Parent  Teacher Conferences, so that students can conference with their parent/guardian and inform them of how well they are  mastering the content. Each month our Parent Coordinator sends home a mailing, including a calendar of all of the  events for the month and any other important information. The Principal holds regular, “Café con Cruz” breakfast  sessions. At these meetings parents are informed about specific topics and have a chance to ask questions and  comment on anything at the school. They also visit classrooms during these sessions. The parents/guardians provide  ideas for future sessions. We hold two Open Houses for incoming students and their families. One in the Fall when 5 th  grade students are completing their Middle School Enrollment Applications and one in June to provide students and  families information for the upcoming school year. The school uses an on-line platform for grades. We can also put  assignments and videos on this site. Parents can look at a student’s grades at any point and they can also download  course material. We work in collaboration with Morris Heights Medical and Mental Health Clinic (housed in our building)   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          44      to provide resources for families. Every Saturday, we hold computer and ESL classes for parents from our school and the  elementary school in our building. Our students assist the parents with the computer-based portion of the class.    Priority Need: After reviewing Tenet 6.3, we believe we need to revise school events and activities so that there is  reciprocal communication and we are accessing the knowledge of parents/guardians to build on the strengths of our  students.         Part 2 – Summative Vision for Strong Family and Community Ties   What is your vision for strong family and community ties at your school?  What opportunities exist for the school staff  to know the students and their families in order to better communicate and partner with families and communities in  the vision for the school?     In SY 2015-2016 we took part in the Dual Capacity Training with Dr. Mapp at Scholastic, which greatly informed our  vision of strong family and community ties at our school. Our vision is that we are working in partnership with families  for the success of our children. We have to listen to families, rather than just tell them what we are doing and what we  think they should do. We also took part in the Academic Parent Teacher Team training in SY 2016-2017 and we learned  how to share data with families, in which they can see how their child is performing on a specific skill or standard in  relationship to the rest of the class. We learned to help families network with one another and specifically how to share  some of our strategies, and have them share strategies with one another, on how to help their child develop in the area  of the data we shared with them.    Some of the opportunities we have to understand families and share our vision are:      -Welcome Back to School Events in September (introduction to teachers and staff at the school; curriculum night)   -Provide information about all upcoming events at the school (calendar, date, time and location)   -Teachers reaching out to families to discuss the curriculum and upcoming units   -Engage parents through workshops, outings and other things that they are interested in (a survey, creating “Getting To  Know You” event/mixer, Family Field Trips)   -Dedicated space in the Parent Association Room (office hours and someone always present) and the Parent  Coordinator’s Office   -Outreach from the school to the parents connecting them to CBO’s   -Computer classes (different levels); Adult Education classes; Resume building; Networking events; Job fairs (using our  resources from Fordham University), Health and Nutrition classes for adults   -On-line grading system and the NYC School Account (training required for both programs, especially for incoming  families)   - Summer induction program 5 th grade students and their parents to life in Middle School       2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          45      -Teachers providing up to date overviews of units of study online for parents to access.   -Additionally, parents will be able to contact teachers directly on their MS331 accounts regarding any questions or  concerns   -School-wide use of Remind to communicate with parents   -Up-to-date school website with information about upcoming events etc.    -Staff has been trained to be part of PARENT TEACHER HOME VISITS to build trust according to the framework of  effective schools.          Within the Community School model, how will families be welcomed into the school and made a part of the school  community?  What support will administrators, teachers, school staff and school safety officers be given to help create  a welcoming environment?   Will there be a dedicated space for families in the school?  Our school sends messages to parents through phone calls, texts, emails, flyers, newsletters, and our Google website.  Parent outreach begins in the beginning of the year to engage in positive communication. In many cases, when parents  get phone calls home, it is because something is wrong. We are breaking that trend and reaching out to parents to  highlight success stories of their children. Our goal is to continuously look for ways to communicate with parents and  engage them with their child’s education. There are many events that the school hosts for parents, one of which is  family welcome night, where parents and students have the opportunity to meet with their child’s teachers and school  leaders. Another family event is our awards night celebratory dinner for students who earned awards throughout the  school year which include super scholar, perfect attendance, and student of the month awards. These students were  recognized by the school and their families. Expanding on the work we have been doing within the community school  model, we want to use the website as a way for busy parents to stay in the loop about celebrations for their child and  see images of P.R.I.D.E ceremonies where students get awarded for most improved or students of the Month etc. To  ensure all stakeholders are part of this welcoming environment that we are establishing on our Google site. The  community liaison will highlight each of our community members (e.g.               How will the school identify and develop families to take leadership roles in school decision making/school governance  structures?  The school leadership team has a group of involved parents who contribute to the decision making in the school. The  parents on the SLT team are connected to the parents of our students in the community and speak on their behalf.  During our community forum, parents were asked to share their feedback on the school by sharing what they love  about the school and share any ideas of what they want to see in the next school year. The school had a Latina  extravaganza event where students and parents would come and represent their culture. Parents were invited through  phone calls and a personal invitation from students and teachers. They completed a form stating the food that they will  cook and bring to the event. Many parents contributed to the event by bringing food, teaching students how to dance  Salsa and Bachata, games and many different activities. This event had a huge turnout and parents genuinely enjoyed  themselves. During the 2017-2018, this event grew exponentially from the prior year the community forum, parents  were given an opportunity to offer suggestions on how they would like to get involved with school events and what role  they will take on in the school. Parents are part of the Parent Engagement Team which meets weekly. This year, the  staff held a family fun day that offered families activities such as painting, Zumba, and content related games.         2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          46            How will the school engage the community and families? How will they ensure that teachers are able to learn from  families about the children being taught?  The school will celebrate community relations through our family welcome night where students and parents have the  opportunity to meet teachers and staff. Families can share with teachers their concerns for their child and how they  would like us to help their child. The school asks for parent/community input at the annual Community Forum. Our SLCs  allow us to create a network amongst parents and teachers so that we are able to learn about the children from the  parents and also show the parents a strategy game they can practice at home.      How do families partner with the school and CBO to support student success?  Will there be dedicated space for  families?    Family partnerships with  school:   There is a parent engagement team that meets weekly to organize parent  engagement activities. Parents play an active role in the planning of these events  that include bake sales, fundraisers, Family Fun Days, parties, conferences, etc…  These meetings allow parents to feel a shared role in student learning and success.      Family partnerships with CBO:  We have a partnership with Fordham university, which works with the parent   engagement team to plan events and activities for the community as well as provide  resources to families.      Is there dedicated space for  these partnerships?   The parent engagement team meets in a large conference room. Ms. Toro, who is  the schools parent coordinator, has an office where parents and staff meet to plan  events. In addition, families have an area is the CBO office.      What data and student progress feedback loops will be present at the school to ensure that families knowledgeable of  their children’s scholastic success, in addition to report cards?  Parents can access our on-line grading platform, TBD, at any time at home. Teachers are to update the system twice per  week. Quarterly data will be accessible through teacher’s classroom when visited on student led conferences. Parents  receive a 'student profile report' from the New Visions Data Tool quarterly.         Part 3 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools – Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be consistent with  the expectations in part 2, responsive to the identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART –  Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Meeting your SMART goal should directly impact  meeting at least one of your Rise Benchmarks.

ELT provides enriching  educational experiences that happen outside of the traditional school day and blend skill acquisition, relationship- building and fun to foster academic and social-emotional growth. Summer learning, afterschool programming, and  extended-day ELT models, when well-implemented, play a critical role in supporting students in all grades and ensuring  that they graduate from high school, college and career ready. SED requires that Priority schools offer a minimum of 200  additional student contact hours as Expanded Learning Time in addition to the current mandated length of 900 hours of  instruction per year (25 hours per week) in grades K-6 and 990 hours of instruction per year (27.5 hours per week) in  grades 7-12. Effective ELT models will blend school staff with community partners, and will provide a balanced  curriculum that can include ELA, math, STEM, arts, physical activity, and leadership development. Complete the sections  on this page to demonstrate how the school will meet these requirements.    Part 1 – ELT Program Goal(s)   Describe the summative goal(s) of the ELT program for the 2018-19 school year. Goals for ELT should aligned to the  Rise Benchmarks.  How will the school will ensure that all students’ individual needs are served during the Rise ELT  and how the school’s vision for ELT will impact both academic achievement and social emotional growth? Be sure to  construct the goal to be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.     During the 2018-2019 School Year, the Administration and CBO/Fordham of MS 331 will offer several academic and  enriching programs to all of our students and we will ensure that there are programs focused to support our students.  We will meet or exceed at 2.49 ELA proficiency rating and a 2.32 Math proficiency rating.         Part 2 – ELT Program Type   Is the ELT program voluntary or compulsory?      Voluntary   X   Compulsory   Rise ELT – Describe what accountability structures the school will employ to ensure participation of all students,  including special populations, will participate fully in Rise ELT.  Additional ELT - If there is a voluntary ELT program in addition to the compulsory Rise ELT, indicate how you will  actively encourage the participation of all students, with the goal of serving at least 50% of students.  All students are programmed to come to school, M-F at 7:45 am. On T- Th they leave school at 3:20 pm and on  Monday and Friday at 2:20 pm. The Renewal time is built into their regular schedule. In addition, we will continue to  offer all of the additional programs after 3:30 pm. We have all art forms and sports. On Saturdays we have special  programs for our Emerging Bilingual students and arts and sports.         Part 3 – ELT Program Description   Target Population: The ELT program for a Rise School will be offered to all students in the school.   Describe how the school will meet the following SED requirements for an ELT program:  How will the school integrate academics, enrichment, and skill development through hands-on experiences that make  learning relevant and engaging?    How will CBO staff and the school’s teachers be integrated to provide a seamless learning day?     Offer a range of activities that capture student interest and strengthen student engagement in learning so as   to promote higher attendance, reduces risk for retention or drop out, and increases the likelihood of  graduation.     Actively address the unique learning needs and interests of all types of students, especially those who may   benefit from approaches and experiences not offered in the traditional classroom setting.   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          51           What new content areas and opportunities will be offered to students? How will the school ensure all IEP and   language mandates are met during ELT?     Contain components designed to improve student academic, social, and emotional outcomes, including   opportunities for enrichment programs such as in music and art.     Ensure instruction in any core academic subject offered in the program will be delivered under the   supervision of a teacher who is NYS certified in that particular content area.     How will community educators receive professional development?  Are there plans to provide joint PD to   school faculty and community partner staff?     What content will be led by pedagogical staff and what content will be led by CBO partners?    How will the school best utilize CBO partners to impact student achievement?    How will effective outreach be conducted to families?    How will programming be made easily accessible to students and families in order to encourage   participation?   Currently, we have a strong partnership with Fordham, as our CBO Partner. We have integrated academic and  extracurricular programming. Students receive an additional 5 hours of academic programming, through ELT, with our  certified teachers. We use the iReady diagnostic data to ensure that meet the specific needs of each student during  this time. Fordham tutors are programmed to work with these small groups by working with our Tier 3 students who  need individual supports. In January, after the mid-year iReady diagnostic, we adjust the ELT groups so that students  have the ability to move to new groups that will continue to meet their specific needs. Teachers and Fordham tutors  receive professional development on how to teach the content of these extra learning hours, as well data meetings  are held with each teacher/provider to analyze impact of the program.    After the academic day, students will have an opportunity to participate in several clubs: boys and girls basketball,  soccer, flag football, girls and boys volleyball, baseball, visual art, dance, music, robotics, video game design, chess,  choir, and french. Also, students take part in girls and boys counseling groups. Junior Honor Society meets monthly.    On Saturdays, our CBO organizes a popular intramural basketball program and we also require students to do iReady  on the computers if they are part of this program. Several times a year a mental health provider also does workshops  with the students on health issues.    Parents/guardians are invited to a session before school showcasing these programs. Teachers, students and the  office staff will continue to inform the parents and encourage enrollment. Showcases take place during the year,  where students can perform and exhibit their art form. A Sports Awards Night is held each year to highlight, with  families, the academic and athletic accomplishments of our student athletes.

Community Schools  bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and family  engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in  Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health &  Wellness.    Part 1 – The Community School Program Goal(s)   How is the Community School strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it  had on student academic outcomes?  The community school collaboration (Fordham University and MS 331) has worked strategically to ensure consistency  and sustainability of improved teacher practices and student learning. These efforts will be outlined throughout this  report. For school year 2016-2017 test data reflects a 9% increase in ELA and a 3% increase in mathematics in Levels 3  and 4. Current test data for 2017-2018 will be available in June 2018 and will be carefully reviewed to access targeted  benchmark achievements.      Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School program for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct  the goal to be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.   The goal of the Community School Program at the Bronx School of Young Leaders, MS 331, as it transitions to a RISE  school is to: (1) continue to provide students with rigorous learning opportunities aligned to the Common Core  Learning Standards (2) support continual development and refinement of teacher practices, and (3) provide a  widened array of mental health and enrichment opportunities for students and families through an extended and  expanded school schedule.    Currently, 22% of the students are meeting the standards in ELA (up from 5.5% in 2014) and 13% *up from 6.3% in  2014) are meeting the standards in Math. By the end of the academic school year 2018-19, the school will  demonstrate progress in meeting the ELA/Math benchmarks moving even a greater percentage of students into levels  3 and 4 on standardized exams in ELA and Math.             Please answer the following question as it relates to meeting your Community School Program Annual Goal(s):  How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in ELT, Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health &  Wellness--support your academic goals for students?  The collaboration between MS 331 and the Fordham partnership will continue to implement high level support that  sustain our remarkable attendance. Through our ELT initiatives we will continue to monitor attendance through the  data sorter to identify students moving in the direction of chronic absences. Our mental health professional staff  along with community school staff will provide high level support to students, parents, and their families through  contracted vendors such as Footprintz Sports Academy, Morris Heights Health Center, Mentoring in Medicine,  Salvadori Center, Robofun, and Fordham tutors. Additional collaborations with components of Fordham University  include Dorothy Day Center, Feerick Center for Social Justice, and Ladies Basketball Team Mentor Support. All of these  supports are designed to address student and family needs upon occasion when follow-up and wrap around services  are needed. The community school staff will make referrals to social service agencies such as hospitals, housing,  clinics, SNAPS, and extra-curricular programs. Parent engagement remains a priority and the community school  monthly activities are available through Parent Association, lead CBO, domestic violence office, St. Barnabus Hospital,  Bronx Works, continuing education, and The Davidson Community Center.

Describe how the school will partner with the Lead CBO to do the following:  1.   Community Schools are expected to partner with a community-based partner organization (CBO) and  together with members of the School Leadership Team, hire a Community School Director. The Director will  lead implementation of the asset and needs assessment process, and other critically important coordinating  activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work.  Community Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and  services, as determined by the asset and needs assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time  (ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the  right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly  coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day.  Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to  strengthen this initiative.  Community Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and  families feel welcome, actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of  their schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community  School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this family engagement  strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work.  Community School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director,  select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual  students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use.  Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work.   2.   3.   4.   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          55      Principal and School Leadership team of the Bronx School of Young Leaders (MS 331) maintains a strong working  relationship with Fordham University's Graduate School of Education (GSE) as the lead organization in the  Community Schools Program (CSP). The Center for Educational Partnerships (part of Fordham's GSE) will manage  the CSP's day-to-day operation. The Director possesses the expertise in the administration and supervision of  instructional programs at the secondary level. The role of the director includes executing the implementation of  the needs and asset assessment, and other critically important coordinating activities. In addition the CSP director  and team members will work closely with the school leadership, faculty, support personnel, and parent  coordinator to strategically plan, deliver and assess the initiatives, support/ referral services and its impact on  school culture, teacher effectiveness, and student achievement.    In an effort to improve student outcomes and engineer successful teaching and learning conditions during the  school day and extended learning time, both partners will work collaboratively at implementing a clear system for  progress monitoring by: (1) studying baseline data on all students’ progress and identifying which students require  Tier 1, 2 and/or 3 interventions and (2) determining the precise targets, level, skills and strategies that students  require to develop mastery.    Fordham University will work closely with the DOE, DOHMH, school administrators, faculty and other service  providers on and off the campus in the joint delivery of all the mental health components, i.e., individually  targeted, selective and universal interventions. In addition to addressing the school community's mental health  and social work needs, the CSP will also provide a social and emotional development learning (SEDL) component  aligned with State Education Department guidelines. Including parents and caregivers where necessary, these  activities will provide adolescents with the various supports they need to develop into well adjusted, purposeful  and productive members of society. These supports (delivered directly or by referral) will include: individual, family  and group counseling; clinical social work interventions, in addition to stress management and life skills  workshops. Workshops presented by the mental health program manager will provide ongoing training throughout  the 2018-2019 school year. New programs will include Move this World and Brain Power.      Fordham University is confident that these activities will help to resolve some of the personal, familial and  domestic issues which have contributed to the achievement gap among students.   There are currently many supports in place including the CBO (Morris Heights) which provides on-site medical and  mental health services. The school has three guidance counselors in place. This component will be supported by a  part time bilingual psychologist, social work interns and mental health professionals retained by Fordham, in  addition to a broad consortium of community partners. These groups will include St. Barnabas, Puerto Rican Family  Institute (PRFI) and St. Rita's Immigration Services. The CSP will also offer services to support the physical health of  the Bronx School of Young Leaders (MS 331) students and their families. To that end, Fordham has already forged  linkages with the Bronx Health Link (TBHL), a coalition of local health care providers. Once each semester, the CSP  will sponsor a Health and Wellness Fair at the Bronx School of Young Leaders (MS 331). Families without medical  insurance will be informed about free and/or low-cost medical coverage, e.g., Medicaid in addition to New York  State's Child and Family Health Plus programs. In order to expand the mental health component over time,  Fordham has secured a grant from IBM. Fordham students involved in this grant will provide “211 Social Services  Referral” using the Watson application. This work in progress will provide immediate on the spot referrals such as:  shelters, pantries, hospitals, counseling etc. This application will be made available to targeted staff and parents  will be able to tap in via a cell phone with internet accessibility.    As a Partnership School, we are cognizant that family engagement is a key element of student success and parents  are the first teachers of their children. We understand the critical role parents play in their children’s education.  The intent of our family engagement program is to establish and sustain strong home-school-community  partnerships because we are convinced that it serves to reduce the gap that exists between the home and the  school, thereby, fostering a climate of partnership. Careful attention has been given to ensure there is a concerted  focus on building family engagement to encourage students to reach their maximum learning potential. Parents   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          56      will attend instructional workshops on the on-line grading system, helping their child to write arguments and learn  about the on-line fluency math program. Program activities will continue to aim to teach and empower families on  how to navigate the school system, be effective advocates, share their insights and ideas with schools and plan  their very own learning journeys. In addition, parents will be encouraged to attend school wide activities, student– led conferences, monthly forums, continuing education programs, family counseling and become part of the school  decision making. Fordham will work closely with the parent coordinator to build on the existing programs offered.  ESL classes are already offered every week and some of the newer activities will include the following: GED classes,  job readiness, and workshops on instructional standards and strategies that can be used at home. In addition, a  collection of resources and materials that parents and students can borrow to complete school assignments and  projects will be made available. School and CBO staff will continue to participate in web related professional  development to ensure effective use of the New Visions Data Sorter.           Part 3 – Community School Partnerships Oversight   Part 3a. Key Staff and Partners  1.  Name and describe the scope of involvement of all community partners working in the school (include partners   supporting ELT, counseling, enrichment, etc.)   2.  Name the members of your Community School Team and how meetings will be organized and structured to   engage all stakeholders and be focused on results.   3.  Explain data strategies including the use of the data sorter, and steps that the school will take to ensure that the   appropriate interventions are provided to the right students      Fordham's Center for Educational Partnerships will work closely with NYSED, NYCDOE, New Visions, and all others  key stakeholders in the joint collection, compilation and analysis of CSP-related data. This activity shall be jointly  managed by the Community Schools Director and the Center's Data Analysis Program Associate. The collection of  program- related data will begin with the CSP Implementation and Planning Phase. During that period, the CSC will  carefully document the creation of the Community School Team (CST). The anecdotal information compiled during  this Phase could be used (upon request from the DOE) to create a "Primer" which could benefit future CSP lead  organizations. Minutes from each CST meeting shall be placed in a Binder for subsequent review. At the end of  each contract period, these minutes will be analyzed to determine the impact this group had on the program's day- to-day operations. Based upon these analyses, Fordham University will consider strategies for improving the CST's  efficacy. The members of the Community School Team are as follows:    Bruce Wallach, CSD    Shana Eutsay, ELT Director   AllisonWitty, Instructional Specialist   Vacancy Social Worker (Morris Heights)      As mentioned, parents and guardians play an important role in the success of the partnership in the CSP. To that  end, adult utilization of program services and level of involvement in the host school will be closely tracked by CSP  staff. Registration forms, attendance sheets and feedback will be maintained for each activity, e.g., parent  workshops/conferences, adult education programs, trips and other volunteer activity, etc., for which parents and  guardians choose to enroll. The input yielded by these documents will be used to drive the CSP's quality assurance  and continuous program improvement activities. Anecdotal feedback provided by the Bronx School of Young  Leaders (MS 331) Parent Association and Parent Coordinator will also figure prominently in the project evaluation   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          57      process. Student participation in all expanded learning and enrichment activities will be reviewed to track  utilization of these services. The Community School Director, the ELT Director, and Educational Specialist will take  an active role in the project review process. These staff will meet with the Bronx School of Young Leaders (MS 331)  teachers on a monthly basis to determine if student performance has improved for youth who participate in ELT  activities. The progress reports, report card grades and standardized assessment scores of these students will also  be reviewed regularly by project staff.      With respect to the CSP’s mental health services, aggregate metrics for program utilization, e.g., number of new  intakes, individual and group counseling sessions, client referrals, etc., will be compiled for evaluation purposes.  Releasing and analyzing this data in aggregate form will protect client privacy around the mental health services  they have received. The effectiveness of this component will also be measured by the number of OORS incidents  reported by the Bronx School of Young Leaders (MS 331) over the course of each academic year.   The supportive resources that Fordham University brings into the school will be carefully analyzed. For example,  quantitative data will be maintained on: 1) total hours of asset building activities conducted by the CSD; 2)  workshops and other trainings offered; 3) asset building hours performed by the CSD; 4) new partners brought into  the CSP consortium; and, 5) material donations and volunteer hours secured by the program. The total dollar  amount of matching grants and contracts secured to support the CSP will also be documented. It is important to  note that Fordham plans to utilize data collection strategies that have proven successful on CSPs across the nation.  These approaches are: 1) the Community School Evaluation Toolkit created by the Coalition for Community Schools  and, 2) the "Effective Data Collection and Sharing" guidelines articulated in "Scaling the Community Schools  Strategy in New York City."   Fordham is providing the following key personnel: full-time Director–on site; full time Mental Health service  provider; part-time Education Specialist and part-time Extended Day Coordinator, all of whom are school based.  The Director reports to Dr. Anita Vazquez Batisti, Fordham Graduate School of Education, Associate Dean and  Director of the Center for Educational Partnerships           Part 3b. Indicate resources needed including human resources, instructional resources, and schedule adjustments to  implement the Community School program.  The Community Schools Director (CSD) will manage the program's day-to-day operation. This full-time employee  will be permanently stationed at the Bronx School of Young Leaders (MS 331) and will have his/her own office in  the building. One of the main roles of the CSD will be to serve as a liaison between all key stakeholders in the  school community (e.g., students, parents, teachers, principal and external partners), Fordham University and the  Department of Education. In their managerial capacity, this employee will assemble and preside over the  Community Schools Team (CST) sub-committee of the Bronx School of Young Leaders (MS 331) School Leadership  Team (SLT). Fordham University maintains that the CSD will also be a sitting member of the building's SLT as well  and attend all meetings held by that group. Dual membership in those two bodies is essential since it will provide  the CSD with a complete, up-to-the-moment understanding of the Bronx School of Young Leaders (MS 331) needs  and current status. The CSD will continue to have regular (as in daily) dialogue with all constituents in the building.  To ensure that the needs of all families are met, the CSD will work closely with the Bronx School of Young Leaders  (MS 331) Parent Coordinator and Parent Association.    Fordham University firmly believes that the process of asset building (i.e., a methodology for sustainable  development of communities based on their strengths and potential) plays a crucial role in reforming multi- problem schools. In the operation of current school-based programs such as its PD Network and R-BERN, Fordham  staff is deployed in the capacity of in-house resource specialists responsible for developing the strategies needed to   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          58      improve teaching and learning in some of NYC's most challenging schools. In a similar fashion, the CSD will be  responsible for identifying and leveraging resources (both inside and outside of the target neighborhood) which  meet the needs of the entire school community. The full resources of Fordham's GSE will be utilized, in an in-kind  fashion, to achieve that objective. For example, in the operation of its UFT Saturday Academy, the Center for  Educational Partnerships has gained considerable experience in recruiting, training and supervising highly- qualified  tutors capable of working with students in danger of academic failure; this expertise has been shared with the CSD  and his staff. Over the years Fordham has been successful in marshaling and coalescing the talents and expertise of  various school community constituents (including parents) to meet outstanding needs in schools served.

Teacher leaders help to write the Assessment calendar for the year, which also involves choosing the assessments  which will be used. Teachers participate in quarterly data meetings to analyze data and adjust plans for instruction  based upon the data. Each week, one department spends the day planning. Part of this meeting is professional  development on how to use their unit assessment data to plan for future instruction.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (R-CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/R-CEP.    2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          67        Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.

The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  R-CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. MS 331, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   MS 331 will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          69      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:      ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability  grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          70      ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report,  Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between /teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

It is not possible to meet all of their academic and social emotional needs within  the school day.  We have looked at our NYSESLAT data,Years of Service data, and our School  Quality Snapshot  to determine the various academic needs of our students.   The supplemental programs that we are offering this year which will utilize Title III funding are:  1. Three hours per week of ELA support for all of our students in the "Expanding" and  '"commanding" category, 30 students.  This class is taught by our Bilingual ELA teacher and our  ENL teacher. (two teachers, certified in bilingual and ENL) The class is for one hour, Tuesday -  Thursday and includes 6 -8th graders.  The program is using a curriculum called Escalate that is  designed specifically for EBL students who are in the 'expanding' and 'commanding'  categories.  The curriculum materials are not paid for with Title III monies.  The focus of the  curriculum lessons are: building vocabulary (academic and content), author's purpose, language  conventions, and writing argument, narrative and informational text. The program will begin on  September 5th and will end on May 30th.  We will use the Title III monies to pay for the  program and will supplement the program costs from other monies in our budget.   Attendance is mandatory, as part of our ELT model, and attendance records will be kept by the  teachers.  Students are also receiving a grade on their report cards for the program and teachers  will keep track of student progress, using formative and summative assessments for both  programs.

Families  completed a survey indicating their needs, which helped us to determine our workshop topics.  Families wished to know more about the high school articulation process, standards for ELA and  Math and state testing, fitness and nutrition, and learning English themselves. Families are  invited to specific high school orientation sessions with schools that serve EBL students, such as  New World High School in the Bronx. Our High School Mini-Fair took place on October 26th,  from 5:00 pm - 7:30 pm.  During Parent Engagment time teachers will communicate with  families about their child's progress.   Parents receive monthly newsletters and calendars in  multiple languages and written by our Parent Coordinator.  Our Parent Coordinator and staff  members make sure that communication is translated into the languages of our students.  Our  Parent Coordinator is also our Language Access Coordinator. Each month families are invited to  "Café con Cruz" which is an open forum between families and the principal.   Every Saturday we  offer free computer and ENL classes to parents, from 9 am -1 pm. This is at no cost to Title  III.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?     We use Fountas and Pinnell in English and in Spanish as well as MyOn.  The English Fountas and Pinnell is used with the  NYSELAT data to group our students for ESL class.  We try to group Entering (EN) and Emerging (EM) students in one class and  the Transitioning (TR) and Expanding (EX)  students in a different class. MyOn allows us to know the lexile reading level of  students in Spanish and in English.  We use the Spanish reading assessment to help us determine student needs for our  bilingual science, social studies and math class as well as to adjust instruction in our Native Language Arts class.  Many of our  students can speak Spanish but aren't as capable at reading or writing in Spanish.  This data assists our bilingual teacher s with  supporting students in reading and writing. Our Instructional Plan is adjusted based upon student data from the assessment.  If  students are EN or EM, they will receive translanguaging instrucitonal supports.  Translanguaging is giving students resources  in their home language in order to produce outputs in English.  The students will receive the newcomer ENL curriculum as well-   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          81         which is called English Now!  The students in the ENL class begin with learning basic vocabulary and grammar which assists  them with reading a story and producing a writing piece.  We have added an extension that is aligned to the CCLS for this class,  so that they are working at beginning levels and then building to higher levels during the unit, once they have learned the  necessary English vocabulary.  Our students that are EX and CM receive support through the English 3D curriculum, which they  receive in addition to receiving the same curriculum as their English fluent counterparts.  The English 3D curriculum supports  the development of academic and content specific vocabulary as well as development of writing at grade level standards.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Weekly Emerging Bilingual Team meeting allows us to review data.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We evaluate academic success by evaluating how closely we are meeting AYP for ELLs and also by our targets in the AMAO.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Weekly EBL meetings with Data Wise Protocols for reviewing and monitoring data.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A        6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   50% of our EBL students made progess in English Language Acquisition.  This is below the target, which was 67.4%.    20.93% of  EBL students achieved proficiency on the NYSESLAT, which was above our target of 15%.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The weekly EBL team meetings and Data Wise Improvement Process protocols.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Students receive ENL class each day.  Students are integrated with all students in the school, however they come out  of their class to attend ENL class for an hour each day as well as a SS/ENL class.       b.  TBE program.  If applicable.      Students receive instruction in science from a certified bilingual teacher and math from a math teacher who speaks  Spanish.  We are currently searching for a Spanish language teacher to teach Native Language Arts.     c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A        2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          82      a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?                 Entering and Emerging students receive 300 minutes of stand alone ENL per week and also 300 minutes of integrated  ENL per week.  Transitioning and Expanding students receive 300 minutes of stand alone ENL per week and also 300 minutes  of integrated ENL per week.  Commanding students receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL per week in our ELT program.        3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.         All of our content area teachers have learned 'translanguaging' skills and these strategies are reinforced during grade and  department meetings as well as during observations. For us, translanguaging menas allowing students to use all of the  languages at their dispossal to receive information and organize their thinking and then producing products (often with peer  and teacher support) in English.  Content area teachers have received materials in the languages students speak and use these  materials during their lessons, as well as translating other important informational text.  Their goals are written in Spanish  each day and they have cognate word walls as well as domain specific and academic vocabulary posted in Spanish and  English.  Assessments are in Spanish and students can write their answers in Spanish. Staff members help to translate these  assessments for teachers who don't speak Spanish.  Bilingual paraprofessionals are in math, science and social studies  classrooms and help to translate whole-class questions and responses for students and teachers.  Beginner level students  attend math, science, and social studies bilingual teacher.             4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?          As stated above, assessments are in Spanish, so that we can appropriately assess how well a student knows the content  and not how well they speak English.             5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status     a.  We have a Saturday program for our SIFE students.  The Saturday program has direct teaching from our bilingual teacher  and also students work on Rossetta Stone and ST Math on the computer.  These two programs allow us to differentiate for  each individual student.   b. Our newcomers are in our ENL class and we developed the curriculum to meet their language needs and also their needs to  become familiar with a new city and new country and plan for their future.  The curriculum utilizes the 'photo-elicitiation'  strategy.  All students have cameras and they create projects around the themes of 'Who am I?", "Our School Community',  "Our Community", and "What is the purpose of school?" Our Newcomers also receive social studies, science and math  instruction from a Spanish speaking teacher.  If they speak a language other than Spanish, they are given a computer and a  tutor who helps to translate material on the computer throughout the day. Students also receive testing accomodations,  including materials in their home language (except for English exams) and extended time.   c/d. Most of our EBLs who have been receiving services for 4-6 years, and are general education students, are integrated into  heterogeneous classes for the majority of the day and receive ENL support.  When we look closely at the data long-term EBLs  and also students who have been receiving services 4-6 yearsand long-term EBLS, the majority are in the D75 hearing impaired  classes that we host at our school and also our Intellectually Disabled self-contained special education class.  They have not  been able to pass the NYSELAT, and I wouldn't expect the ID students to be able to, and therefore show up on the report as  needing to continue to receive services, which we do provide.  Students receive testing modifications, including materials in  their home language (except for English reading/writing exams) and extended time.        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?    2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          83       Most of our EBL-SWD students are in the classes we host from D75.  The teachers in these classes use grade-level core  curriculum materials and provide supports, such as interpreters, alternative placement paras to translate, and also  translanguaging strategies, such as providing materials in Spanish.  Students also have access to computer based programs that  accelerate English language development, such as Rosetta Stone.          7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  A ll of our non-D75 students, are in ICT classes, except students that are in our ID self-contained class.  Even students in the  D75 and ID classes are integrated for enrichment and ENL classes. Some of the D75 hearing impaired students are  mainstreamed for subjects they are strong in.           8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.    Transitioning, Expanding and Commanding students receive math and ELA intervention in an extra period three days per  week.  Our advanced EBL (Emerging Biilingual Learners) students receive an extra period of ELA three days per week.  Our SIFE  and Emerging/Entering students attend a Saturday program for ELA/Math and receive homework help four days per week for  an hour.        9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      We plan to integrate our EBL students into general education homerooms.           10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?     N/A     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.   Our EBL students are already part of our after-school AIS reading and math programs.  They are also able to sign up for any of  our clubs and extracurricular activities.  We offer a full sports program and an arts program, many of our EBLs take advantage  of these programs.           12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Some students receive an individual iPad or laptop to use Google translate throughout the day.  We wrote a grant for every  student who is an EBL to get their own iPad.  Rosetta Stone is used by our beginner level students.  ST Math is utilized in math  classrooms (both bilingual and not). ST Math is a platform which allows students to work on grade level math concept, without  words.  We have MyOn reading, which is a digital reading platform which will read stories aloud to students, suggest books to  students at their lexile level in English or in Spanish and students have the option to change the language to Spanish on the  screen and work in Spanish. Our Advanced students use Scholastic's English 3D program in an additional literacy block, three  days per week.  Content area teachers utilize Spanish language textbooks, Google translate and in-house translated materials  for their lessons.              13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?    SL/TBE:  Students have access to materials/curriculum in their home language in all content area classes.  In ESL class there is  an extensive library of Spanish books and some Bengali books.  Students can check out books in those languages or English and  count them toward our book requirement of reading three books per month.  Bilingual paraprofessionals also provide home  language support in content area classes.  Our ESL teacher speaks many languages, including Spanish and can utilize Spanish to  provide support during ESL.  Three of our enrichment teachers speak Spanish and they provide support before and after school  on the computer programs students use. We have a bilingual science, social studies and math teacher.   We offer students NLA  in Spanish to develop their home language.         2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          84         14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Our ESL curriculum was written to support students specifically during Middle School as they prepare for High School and  begin thinking about life after High School.  Students are immersed in a unit of study which assesses their future interests  and  teaches them about the importance of  choosing high schools and having experiences which prepare them to build on  those interests.  Students also contribute to our school community through their photo essay projects and this aligns with the  developmental level of middle school students and their want of service projects and doing positive projects.  We have a  vendor who helps us find materials/books in students' home language which are age appropriate.         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Some students receive an individual iPad or laptop to use Google translate throughout the day.  We wrote a grant for every  student who is an EBL to get their own iPad.  Rosetta Stone is used by our beginner level students.  ST Math is utilized in math  classrooms (both bilingual and not). ST Math is a platform which allows students to work on grade level math concept, without  words.  We have MyOn reading, which is a digital reading platform which will read stories aloud to students, suggest books to  students at their lexile level in English or in Spanish and students have the option to change the language to Spanish on the  screen and work in Spanish. Our Advanced students use Scholastic's English 3D program in an additional literacy block, three  days per week.  Content area teachers utilize Spanish language textbooks, Google translate and in-house translated materials  for their lessons.              16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   The principal meets with each new family as they enroll.  We talk about where they are from and have a sense of the town and  school system they were in. EBL students and their families from 5th grade participate in open  houses, organized by our  administration, parent coordinator and counselor, that take place during the year before they articulate to 6th grade as well as  at the beginning of their 6th grade year. We have started a  'Newcomer Group' counseling group which is run by our bilingual  guidance counselor.           17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?     Unfortunately, none at this time.           18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  All of our staff participate in 80 minutes of PD on Mondays of each week.  These weeks are designed in Professional Learning  Cycles, of around 4 -6 weeks.  Each cycle has a different theme and sometimes during the year there will be more than one  topic of focus.   These meetings are our key vehicle for providing staff development.  All of the cycles involve looking at student  workand EBL student work is integrated.  We use the protocol to discuss the students strengths and also to provide feedback  to the teacher on their instructional approach.  Often this meeting entails discussing what language supports were provided to  EBL students and what difference that made in the final product.  Specific topics which will entail isolated focus on EBLS   2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          85         include: Using Assessment in Instruction and Vocabulary Instruction.    All teachers receive professional development on translanguaging: using home language supports to get English  products.  Teachers of ELLs are receiving training this year on the SIOP method.          2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.   We provide "The First Thirty Days" lesson plans and smartboard slides which help teachers teach students how to be  organized for success in middle school and also about the policies of the school.     All teachers will be a part of six, 100 minute sessions, that focus on vocabulary acquisition.  All teachers will be part of another  six part series of 100 sessions on translanguaging.  The bilingual education/ENL teachers will receive 40 weeks of one hour  sessions specific to teaching EBL students through out EBL team.  Agendas, attendance and minutes are kept digitally.           Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   As parents register they have an individual conference with the principal.  The parent coordinator, principal and EBL team  members will schedule 1:1 meetings with parents of EBL students to discuss progress and also resources available to them.      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  Our EBL parents are very involved in our school.  Several parents are part of weekly ESL classes.  Each month parents attend a  meeting with the principal called, "Café con Cruz" and discuss different topics they have expressed interest in having.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Serapha Cruz, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP-RISE                                                                                                                                                                                          87                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   The Bronx School of Young Leaders                                                                              School DBN: 10X331  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
