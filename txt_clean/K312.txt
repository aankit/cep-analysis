This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      The school’s mission statement is: P.S. 312 is committed to providing a safe, supportive, and engaging learning  environment that promotes high expectations, excellence in learning, and social and emotional growth for all  learners. We will offer a rigorous curriculum aligned to the common core learning standards and research based  instruction by highly qualified professionals to meet the needs of our diverse learning community. We will work   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      collaboratively with parents and the community to provide our students with college and career readiness skills that  will prepare them to become lifelong learners and productive citizens of the global community.          2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   P.S. 312, The Bergen Beach School, is a dynamic, engaging school that is committed to educating all students using a  rich instructional approach. Aligned with our mission, we also collaborate with many outside organizations by writing  grants to enhance the core curriculum. We have been fortunate to partner with the Brooklyn Historical Society on a  yearly basis. Through this partnership, the students have created historical pieces that represent the local history of  Bergen Beach. In addition to the outside partnerships, P.S. 312 promotes high expectations by incorporating the Arts  into the curriculum. P.S. 312 also has a dynamic senior and junior band, a 4th and 5th grade chorus, and in the recent  years incorporated 4th and 5th grade Dance companies . The students of fifth grade also benefit from the many clubs  that enrich their learning experience. Of these clubs, there is a Theater Club that prepares for a performance  throughout the school year. This preparation leads to a culminating, Off-Broadway type of show that the school  community enjoys. For school year 2018 - 2019, we are continuing to incorporate a number of 4th grade clubs as well.  Some of these clubs range from Italian, Mock Trial, Legos with Brains, to Keyboarding(piano). Some other clubs that  students are involved in are Zumba clubs, math games, The Kind Kids club, as well as a Sports & Fitness Club. Our 5th  grade students benefit from a Lego Club, Rock Band, Future Teacher Club, Basketball Club, Cheerleading , Art, as well  as an Interactive Newspaper Club. Many of our students have opportunities to be a part of an Enrichment club  through strategic scheduling.    Our school began a PBL initiative beginning in School Year 2014 -2015 and has been growing year after year. Our  school will be continuing this teaching and learning approach entitled, “Project-Based Learning” for SY1819. Project- based learning is a dynamic classroom approach in which students actively explore real-world problems and  challenges and acquire a deeper knowledge using 21 st century skills. Through extensive organization and planning,  three PBL units will be planned in either a Science Unit or a Social Studies Unit for each grade in P.S. 312. Teachers will  also use the NYC Passport to Social Studies as a guide for ideas when planning for some of their PBL units. This school  year, we are also looking to add more gold standard PBLs and PBLs that incorporate more models to represent the  change in the Science Standards. In addition, our school will continue some of our Professional Learning Sessions  around this approach. Along with the special units, the students will take a minimum of three meaningful field trips a  year to enhance their units of study with either and entry event or a closure or a trip in between the learning process  and also have an opportunity to perform on stage throughout the school year. During the school year 2018-2019, our  school will look deeply into the PBL units that have been developed and develop new units that incorporate impacts  that can be made in the real world while still stimulating the standards that will be learned. For example, our third  grade students will be studying the effects of recycling and water pollution. Their driving question that they will  investigate throughout the process will be, "How can we, as students, make a different in our community and help  other communities in the process? How can we as environmentalists help others learn more about recycling and what  they can do to help the environment?" They will initiate a green team and a recycling team as one of the ways to  increase their learning. This is one of the many PBL units that our school is extremely proud of.   Our school has also adopted the Amplify Science Curriculum. The Amplify Science Curriculum was vetted by the city to  enhance more of a hands on approach as well as deeper thinking through the Science concepts and standards. This  program is also aligned to the PBL model of teaching and learning.             3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Our special populations are comprised of SWDs and ELLs. We have four self contained classes and an ICT class on each  grade inclusive of Pre-K. We have a small number of ELLs and former ELLs that are serviced by our in-house ELL  Teacher with the majority of classes being a push-in model.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   As for the overall Framework for Great Schools, the element in which our school has made the most progress is within  the element for Rigorous Instruction.       According to the 2017-2018 school survey, the Rigorous Instruction element soared far above the city and the District.  The Rigorous Instruction element scored at 4.73. Compared to the District-wide average, 22K312 scored above the  district by +0.99 and compared to the City-wide average, 22K312 scored above the city by +1.04.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Column B   Verify with an (X)   Section Reference(s)   Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local                                                  1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 312 Bergen Beach School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I,  Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   P.S. 312 Bergen Beach School will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● Maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● Providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

It is a  supplemental Enrichment/Intervention program that will promote academic and linguistic  literacy for students in grades K-5.  We are running this program on Saturday so that our ELL  students can take advantage of our other AIS and Enrichment programs that are given before  school and after school during the week.There will be one ENL licensed teacher who will teach  the program and instruction will take place in English. The program is projected to run 24  sessions beginning on November 3, 2018 through June 15, 2019. The sessions will take place on  the following dates: Nov. 3, Nov. 10, Nov. 17, Dec. 1, Dec. 8, Dec. 15, Jan. 5, Jan. 12, Jan. 26,  Feb. 2, Feb. 9, Mar. 2, Mar. 9, Mar. 16, Mar. 23, Mar. 30, Apr. 6, Apr. 13, May 4, May 11, May  18, Jun. 1, Jun. 8, and Jun. 15. There will be two instructional groups- Grade K-2 (8:30 a.m.-10  a.m.) and Grades 3-5 (10 a.m.-11:30 a.m.). We have 28 current ELLs and 5 FELLs. Of these  students, 7 students are SWDs.  Each group will not have more than 15 students to ensure that  the children are given as much individual attention as needed. The main curriculum areas for  instruction will be reading, listening, and writing. According to the data from the 2017  NYSESLAT,  those modalities were the most challenging areas for our ENL students, especially  our Grade 3 and Grade 4 students which are our biggest groups. On the 2017 NYSESLAT, the  average score in reading was 58.7%, the average score in listening was 61.5%, and the average  score in writing was 66% which were well below speaking (84.9%).The school will provide  grade appropriate materials that are fully aligned with the Common Core Standards.  We will be  using TEAM Toolkits: Teaching ELLs for Academic Language Mastery.  The program is  aligned to grade level content and standards. It addresses all of the modalities: listening, reading,  writing, and speaking, which will help our students develop academic language and skills needed  for classroom success . The program consists of a teacher's kit, student instructional books,  assessments, audio  CDs, digital resources, and a picture dictionary. Each lesson features 5 parts:  Before We Read, Let's Read, Listen and Discuss, Learning about Language, and Write About It  activities. Differentiated instruction will be utilized to address each student's individual  needs.  We will also be incorporating guided reading into the weekly lesson and will be using  Leveled Literacy Intervention Set C-N and ENL Emerging and Fluent Guided Reading Sets D- M. We will be purchasing more guided reading sets on Levels M-S for our upper grade students.  These materials are supplemental and will only be used for the Saturday ELL  Academy.  Enrichment will be delivered through the use of multimedia resources: Internet (  ex. RAZ Kids, Starfall), iPads and apps, music, art, Reader's Theater, the classroom library, and  centers. Formative and Summative assessments will be used to monitor and track students'  progress. Attendance will be taken weekly and recorded by the teacher on a spreadsheet which  will be handed in to administration. Parents will be notified of the program through letters and  emails in English and their preferred language.  All documents, including letters, agendas, parent  attendance sheets, will be kept on file. If necessary, our parent coordinator will arrange for home  language support and translation services over the phone or in person.  Four parent workshops  will be held on Saturday and four parent workshops will be held during Tuesday Parent  Engagement time (2:30 p.m.-3:30 p.m.).

She will attend  monthly District 22 ELL Ambassador meetings as well as ELL professional development  sessions offered by the Office of English Language Learners and the Brooklyn FSC at no cost to  the Title III Program.  She will support classroom teachers by providing push-in instruction and  modeling ENL scaffolds and strategies. In addition she will supply materials and resources to  enhance classroom instruction for ELLs.  Ms. Karas will be provided time to collaborate and  plan with  those teachers with whom she will be teaching integrated ENL: Ms. Shatz, Ms.  Poggioli, Ms. Mangano, Mr. Barberi, Ms. Alpert, Ms. Catinella, Ms. Morrello, Ms. Montgomery,  and Ms. Monahan. She will turn-key the workshops she attends to the classroom teachers during  school wide professional development times on Mondays in 45 minute sessions.  Topics to be  covered will be ENL instructional methods, Advanced Literacy-Hallmarks 1-4, Language  Learning resources, and Language Scaffolding Strategies. Copies of agendas, handouts,  and  attendance sheets will be kept on file by Ms. Karas and handed in to administration. We will also  be sending Ms. Karas and the classroom teachers of ELLs for intervisitations to other model ELL  programs in District 22 schools (P.S. 139, P.S. 217 and P.S. 254). These professional  development opportunities will positively impact ELL language development because teachers  will be exposed to instructional best practices and practical hands-on strategies to better address  their ELL students' needs.

We recognize the need for ELL parents to feel engaged by our  school and to feel a part of our community.  According to ELL parents who were surveyed, they  indicated that a Saturday program was the most convenient time for them to both bring their  children to school and also for them to attend parent engagement activities.  In addition, the  parents expressed a desire for more workshops on how to help their children in reading and  writing at home.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Our school uses the Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment System. It is administered to determine independent and  instructional reading levels, form initial groups for reading instruction, plan efficient and effective instruction, and assist  teachers in identifying children who need intervention. This type of assessment assists teachers in gathering valuable  information about each child's individual processing strategies, fluency, and comprehension giving them insights about how to  target their teaching. Progress in Guided Reading levels is monitored. This year 100% of ELLs showed improvement from  September levels to present. Fundations is our phonics program and in grades K-2.  In Fundations there are end of unit tests as  well as formative assessments throughout.  End of chapter tests, performance tasks and MOSLs are given in Math.  We use a  Balanced Literacy model in Reading and the Writer's Workshop model in literacy.  End of Unit assessments as well as teacher   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50         checklists and quizes are used.  This data informs our schools instructional plan by revealing the trends in progress in reading  levels being made by our ELL students at all grade levels.         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Grade level planning sessions are held weekly.  At that time, teacher analyze assessments and discuss next steps for students.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We evaluate the success of our ELL program using the standardized test results in grades 3, 4 and 5 on the NYSESLAT,  ELA,  Math,  and Science tests.  In the grades K, 1 and 2 we evaulate with the NYSESLAT, and Fountas and Pinnel Benchmark  Assessment System.                4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    We adhere to the RTI model of academic intervention.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]     Our school uses data to guide instruction of ELLs within the RTI framework for K-5 by assuring universal screening of all  students to establish a baseline of student performance and identify students who are not making academic progress at  expected rates.  Strong core instruction is delivered to all students in the general education classroom by qualified  instructors.  Intensive targeted intervention is provided to support ELLs who are not showing sufficient progress on the skills  and/or competencies measured. Progress monitoring informs how at risk students are responding to instruction.          6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Sufficient data is not available at this time.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   We disseminate our findings to teachers and parents as soon as they become available. Teachers are informed of outcomes in  grade level meetings.  Parents are informed both in letters backpacked home as well as in Parent-Teacher conferences.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Instruction for ELLs is delivered to students in Standalone ENL in heterogeneous small groups that contain either one  grade level or two contiguous grade levels combined if the numbers are low.  Pull-out will be scheduled in order to  meet the mandated minutes for each child's proficiency levels of 180 minutes for Entering and Emerging levels and  360 minutes for Transitioning and Expanding levels per week. ELLs are placed in one mainstream classroom to  facilitate quick pick up and drop off of students. Integrated ENL instruction will be delivered to former ELLs via push-in  into a content area class such as; ELA, Math, Science or Social Studies.  Again students will be grouped together to  facilitate scheduling and to meet the required 90 minutes per week of instruction.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51         b.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Pull-out will be scheduled in order to meet the mandated minutes for each child's proficiency levels of 180 minutes for  Entering and Emerging levels and 360 minutes for Transitioning and Expanding levels per week. ELLs are placed in one  mainstream classroom to facilitate quick pick up and drop off of students. Integrated ENL instruction will be delivered  via  push-in into a content area class such as; ELA, Math, Science or Social Studies.  Again students will be grouped together to  facilitate scheduling and to meet the required minutes per week of instruction.  HLA is not currently offered at our school.        3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   At P.S. 312, Core content is scaffolded for ELLs.   Our free standing ENL and Integrated push-in programs incorporate the  balanced literacy frame work and the use of the workshop model. Within this balanced literacy framework, students learn to  read and write by phonemic awareness, word recognition/phonic strategies, fluency, background knowledge and vocabulary,  comprehension strategies and motivation. These skills are taught using shared reading, independent reading, small group work  and by use of read alouds.  Students are grouped into heterogeneous mixed proficiency level classes of either one grade or  two contigeous grade levels combined. Content area instruction is aligned to the Common Core standards. Collaboration with  the classroom teachers serve to ensure curricula alignment and instructional improvement for the ELLs. The program uses a  combination of instructional materials such as Big Books, small guided reading books and workbooks from three supplemented  integrated ENL curriculum using Reading A-Z.com materials with ELL specific supplements. In addition, the print rich ELL  classroom is equipped with highly motivated multi-leveled and cross cultural books in our miniature library. Instruction is  differentiated to address each child’s individual needs and level of proficiency.  English is the language of instruction with  native language supports such as bilingual dictionaries, glossaries and bilingual texts.  Content is made comprehensible by use  of pictures and realia, as well as pre-reading activities to introduce new concepts and build background knowledge. Language  development is enriched through discussion, and explicit vocabulary and grammar instruction. During reading, comprehension  is evaluated through questioning.  After reading, newly acquired knowledge is synthesized through additional discussion and in  writing activities.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?    At this time we do not use the Spanish or the Chinese reading tests.  We have low numbers of students with those home  languages and the majority of ELLs enter in grade K and are not yet able to read.        5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Instruction is differentiated for ELLs, future SIFE, Newcomers, Long Term ELLs in alternative placement in Special  Education  and Transitional ELLs, ELA, math, and other content areas are offered in English with native language supports.a.  Currently we do not have SIFE students.  In the event that we do, our RTI team will intervene to support gaps in content area  knowledge and literacy skills.b. Our newcomers are given 360 minutes per week of ESL services.  Instruction is targeted to  jump start second language development.c.  Our ELLs with 4-6 years of service are serviced according to their proficiency  levels; Entering and Emerging are serviced 360 minutes and Transitioning and Expanding 180 minutes. Students English   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      language skills are targeted. d.  Currently we do not have any long term ELLs.  In the event that we do, our RTI team will  intervene to enhance second language skills.e.  Former ELLs will receive Integrated ENL instruction in their content area  classrooms for 2 years for 90 minutes per week after reaching a Commanding level on the NYSESLAT by the ENL teacher. They  will also continue to get time and a half on all state tests.       6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   ELL instructional strategies are indicated in the the Ready Gen materials within each unit for all our K-5 classes. Among those  strategies are explicit vocabulary teaching routines and graphic organizers to aid scaffolding of content and for writing.  Content is made comprehensible by use of pictures and realia, as well as pre-reading activities to introduce new concepts and  build background knowledge. Language development is enriched through discussion, and explicit vocabulary and grammar  instruction. During reading, comprehension is evaluated through questioning.  After reading, newly acquired knowledge is  synthesized through additional discussion and in writing activities.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Our school uses curricular, instructional, and flexible scheduling to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and to attain  English proficiency within the least restrictive environment.  ELL students are grouped together to facilitate the ENL teacher in  pushing-into classes to service ELL-SWDs.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.   Targeted intervention programs for ELLs, future SIFE, Newcomers, Long Term ELLs in alternative placement in Special  Education and Transitional ELLs in ELA, math, and other content areas are offered in English with native language  supports.Targeted Instruction (small group targeted instruction based upon individual assessed needs)-ENL teacher will  become familiar with the Science standards and will be provided with Staff Development to understand the Scope and  Sequence of each grade curriculum. The ESL teacher will embed Science vocabulary into her daily ENL lessons.  Mathematics  instruction will include access to Go Math resources including the ELL Guide with vocabulary and other activities for ELL  students. Student Assessment Analysis (individual prescriptive and diagnostic plans are designed to facilitate tutoring of  differentiatedinstruction).  Pupil Personnel Committee (conferences among professionals are conducted to review student’s  cumulative records and recommend interventions). Transitional Services are offered for a period of two academic school years  for former ELLs based on the NYSESLAT. Transitional students on our Focus Plans (which identify at risk students and the  intervention plan that each teacher uses to achieve success) are targeted. We offer a Saturday Program with additional ENL  instruction by a certified ENL teacher. Continuing transitional support ( 2 years) for ELLs reaching Commanding level on the  NYSESLAT is offered in our AIS reading and math after school program.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Some improvement that we will consider for the upcoming school year in our ENL program are doing more push in/integrated  teaching in the core content classrooms, increasing the level of scaffolding for ELL learners in all content areas and also  incorporating Project Based Learning within the ELL curriculum.          10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   n/a        11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs. We will be offering chorus and band after school so as not to interfere  with programming.  Also they will be offered AIS after school, ELA and Math test preparation as well as the Title III After School  ELL Enrichment Program. Notices are backpacked home (in multiple languages) to inform parents of programs offered at our  school.  ELLs are strongly encouraged verbally by their teachers to attend as much of this programming as possible.

Sign up for these  programs is at the moment ongoing however ELLs at our school have had a high rate of participation in the past and we  anticipate the trend will continue this year.        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Computers, Ipads and Smartboards are used.  Brainpop Jr.com is used for content areas such as ELA, Science and Social  Studies, with closed captions to support reading and listening skills.  Students can correlate academic vocabulary, listening  skills and reading skills by watching the video lessons and participating in the interactive activities that accompany each  lesson.  ReadingA-Z.com interactive books are used and bilingual versions of those texts are printed out and given to students  to use side by side with the English version when available.            13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Glossaries and bi-lingual dictionaries, translation apps, Google translate and mini-libraries are used in the classroom.  When  appropriate, students are grouped with other students who share the same home language.  Multi-cultural texts are an  integral component in the ENL curriculum. We do not offer DL or TBE programs.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All required services/resources support and correspond to ELL's ages and grade levels.  ENL services are delivered in grade  level classes.  Texts are leveled to meet the needs of students.        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Computers,  Ipads and Smartboards are used.  Brainpop Jr.com is used for content areas such as ELA, Science and Social  Studies, with closed captions to support reading and listening skills.  Students can correlate academic vocabulary, listening  skills and reading skills by watching the video lessons and participating in the interactive activities that accompany each  lesson.

Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Mandated Parent Orientation sessions are offered on each grade level as new students are admitted and have been screened  as ENL eligible. New ELLs who enroll throughout the school year have a parent orientation by appointment with our ENL  teacher.  Our parent coordinator is present to assist with translation services when needed and to distribute translated  materials. All new students are offered a tour of the building by student ambassadors and/or the ENL teacher or parent  coordinator.          17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Presently we do not offer any language electives.           18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         d.

Translators are on hand to offer their services at this meeting. Recommendations  for middle school placements are made to parents by teachers, counselors and the parent coordinator during both parent- teacher conferences and on an on-going basis. Guidance counselors have received professional development in house by our  ESL teacher and are sensitive to the needs of our ELL population. Letters of recommendation for middle school entrance are  provided by each fifth grade child's classroom teacher upon request. Fifth grade teachers arrange Buddy Days for students to  visit middle schools in the area and get a sense of what each of our neighboring schools is like.  Our parent coordinator sends  home notices for Open Houses being held at middle schools.  Fifth grade teachers advise students and write recommendations  for middle school admissions and send folders to new teachers with the students fifth grade work and assessment results.  As  per CR Part 154.2 Professional Development for all ELL personnel that is specific to ELL topics will be 15% of of their total  hours   of professional development and 50% for our ENL teacher.  Agendas are kept on file for those sessions that are out of  the building and attendance is recorded for sessions that are in house.         Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Our school provides annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the ENL program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas.  Every  ELL student's parent/guardian is scheduled for one-on-one meetings with the ENL teacher on Tuesday afternoons once a year  in addition to the mandated parent-teachers conferences.  Interpreters are present by request or over-the-phone  interpretation is also offered if needed.  A record of attendance is kept by the ENL teacher.     2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Our Parent Coordinator will continue to assist in increasing parental involvement by having letters to parents translated in  their native languages, providing interpreters to assist in meetings, and sending a monthly newsletter about school events and  activities to parents. She will also assist at school events. Parents are invited to monthly meetings. Subjects such as  mother/daughter night and father/son night are conducted each year. Health awareness workshops are conducted as needed-  such as H1N1. The parent coordinator conducts an outreach program and distributes surveys. Eight Parent Engagement  sessions are offered either after school or on Saturdays to inform parents of activities that they can do with their children at  home as well as to disseminate resources available to them in the community, online and in our library.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   The Bergen Beach School                                                                              School DBN: 22K312  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Upon registration, parents are asked verbally by the Pupil Personnel Secretary if they require translation and  interpretation services. In addition, parents are asked in writing on the HLS and interviewed by a pedagogue. That  data is entered on each child's emergency contact card within the first 30 days of a student's enrollment. During  ESL Parent Orientation parents are again asked if they would like translation services. A list of the parents who  request translation services is kept year to year and added to by our Parent Coordinator. A memo goes out school  wide to teachers to survey them about parents who might be having difficulty understanding English and  translation and interpretation services are then offered to assist those parents on an ongoing basis and during  Parent Teacher conferences. A multi-lingual sign is placed at our entrance above the security desk informing  parents that translation services are available. This year we have hired a paid Spanish translator to be on hand for  Parent Teacher conferences as well as for IEP meetings. On the notice inviting parents to Parent Teacher  conferences there is a line which states that these services are available upon request. Surveyed teachers and  parents were found to need help in supporting their children with homework. The Homework Hotline number on  a sticker is given to students to put in their planners. Google translate is used by teachers for notes home and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      translating various documents that are distributed throughout the year.
