This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      Our mission is for our staff, parents, students and the community to work collaboratively to provide our diverse  student body with a high quality, standards based education in two languages and to create an environment that is  supportive of the needs of the whole child through which we can help students grow to become confident individuals,  creative thinkers and problem solvers, prepared to succeed in our global community. Our core values are represented   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      in our motto: We R.I.S.E. to the challenge. Respect, Innovation, Support and Effort are the values that guide our work  and are present in every action and interaction that take place within our school community.            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    P.S. 77 opened in 2014 to help alleviate overcrowding in this specific region of District 10. In the 2018-19 school year  we will serve students in Pre-Kindergarten through fourth grade with a total enrollment of approximately 402  students.          We are committed to offering a rigorous and high quality education to our diverse population of students. To this end,  in addition to providing a curriculum that is aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards as well as other New  York State Standards we offer and emphasize the following:      -Dual Language Program      -Global Education      -Service Learning      -Family and Community Partnerships         DUAL LANGUAGE PROGRAM:      P.S.77 offers a Spanish dual language program which starts in Pre-Kindergarten with the goal of ensuring that  students participating in the program will become bilingual and bi-literate by the time they go on to middle school.       With a population of 28% English Language Learners served through the school, and another 25% English Proficient  students participating in the dual language program, our total population of students learning a new language is   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      approximately 53 %. The diverse backgrounds and needs of our student population makes it increasingly important to  differentiate instruction for students at varying levels of academic and language proficiency. Understanding the  intricacies of the language acquisition process, we have implemented school wide structures to help us better address  the language needs of our students and will continue to dedicate time and resources to growing our practices around  this area.          GLOBAL EDUCATION AND SERVICE LEARNING:      Preparing students for success in a global community calls for knowledge and skills that go beyond content mastery.  In order to succeed in the 21st century, our students will need to exhibit creative thinking and problem solving skills,  and be able to communicate and collaborate with others from diverse backgrounds. At P.S. 77 we help students  develop these skills by providing rigorous curricula and emphasizing global awareness and connections integrating  global connection objectives within each lesson, providing opportunities for students to work both independently and  collaboratively, and celebrating each others' cultural heritage and background. In addition to providing these  opportunities through the core curricula, our students are also provided with opportunities to develop leadership  skills and get involved in the community through service learning projects and civic engagement opportunities.  Throughout the years, such opportunities have included creating care packages and conducting monthly visits to a  local nursing home, raising money for charities, and conducting special events to raise awareness about social issues.          PARTNERSHIPS:      Our school offers multiple opportunities for parents and the community to be involved. Every year we welcome our  families back to school with a Family Fair. In addition to welcoming families we also invite community based  organizations to share information about the resources they provide to the community. Thanks to these annual  events, our families have secured health care, legal and immigration services, support obtaining housing assistance,  and much more. Another noteworthy annual event which brings dozens of families to our classrooms is our annual  Dads Take You r Child to School Day. These two events alone set the stage for a year of active parent involvement.  Our Pre-Kindergarten classrooms offer open classroom sessions once a week to give parent an opportunity to see  how their children engage in learning at school. In Kindergarten and beyond, open classroom events and publishing  parties are held once a month for the same purpose. In addition to having partnerships with local community  organizations, we also partner with Music and the Brain, Studio in a School and DreamYard to enhance the arts  programs at our school.         Our instructional practices are driven by the needs of our students. In order to keep a pulse on said needs, students at  P.S.77 are assessed using benchmark assessments in reading five times a year, three of which include baseline (B),  mid-year (M), and end-of-year (E) reading inventories. Teachers also assess students using on-demand writing  samples and grade level math tests as beginning, middle and end of year assessments. For students participating in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      the dual language program in Kindergarten through fourth grade, these assessments are also administered in Spanish.  Teachers use data collected from several sources to revise curriculum maps and modify lessons in a way that reflects  the needs of our unique population, while still challenging and engaging our students intellectually.       In preparation for the next school year, all families of incoming students attend an orientation meeting in which we  provide information about our program, share our expectations for students and families, and also provide  recommendations to parents about how to continue the learning, and prepare for school over the summer. Families  of students currently enrolled in our school attend an end of year meeting to discuss overall progress made by the  grade and school throughout the year, and are also provided with recommendations for how to help their children  prepare for the next grade. Our school provides students with assignments to complete over the summer which  reinforce academic as well as social skills. This continued practice will help them maintain, and further develop the  skills they acquired throughout the year. In September, families receive a Parent Handbook which contains important  information about school wide policies and procedures around topics like attendance, behavior expectations,  homework policy and others. Included in the handbook is also a copy of our tentative calendar of school wide events.  Sharing dates of events with so much time in advance allows our parents to plan ahead and make arrangements so  they are available to participate.              3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Our student demographics consist of a diverse population of students. English Language Learners (ELLs) make up  approximately 27% of our population while students with disabilities (SWD) make up 15% of the population.       Our student body speaks at least eight different languages at home; these include Albanian, Arabic, Bengali,  Bulgarian, French, Hungarian, Urdu, and more. Through our dual language program and an emphasis on global  education, we are able to promote cultural awareness and acceptance. The need to provide oral language and  vocabulary support becomes increasingly important under these circumstances.      Sharing a campus with P.469 which is a district 75 school and having a population of 15 %SWD makes furthering the  inclusion of students with disabilities at our campus amongst our top priorities. Through our participation in the  citywide Collaborative Communities program our two schools have shared resources and expertise in a way that both  school communities benefit from. One example of this can be seen in our inclusive program in which students with  significant disabilities are provided with a Least Restrictive Environment within a general education setting receiving  special education supports. We began this collaboration in 2016 and have grown the program to include two classes.  Similar inclusive practices have taken flight in less formal settings within our school using structures like joint school  wide events and buddy classes. We are particularly excited about the peer mentoring opportunities the buddy class  program affords students by allowing them to develop and use leadership and social skills.             2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The 2017-2018 School Quality Guide shows notable progress in the areas of Rigorous Instruction and Strong Family- Community Ties. On average, there was an increase of .12 across the elements with the highest increments seen  within the element of Rigorous Instruction.    The descriptions that follow are provided as highlights of the 2017-18 school year within each element of Framework:   Rigorous Instruction:   Every lesson includes a language objective as well as a global connections objective which leads to a deeper  exploration of content.    The practice of differentiating instruction through small group and one to one data driven lessons continued.   Stronger emphasis on building academic vocabulary by explicitly teaching vocabulary and providing more  opportunities and structures for discussions (i.e. talk moves, emphasis on academic vocabulary, etc.).   Collaborative Teachers:   By offering cycles of professional development targeting teachers’ needs and interests, and common planning time  throughout the week, teachers are able to collaborate with grade level colleagues to share best practices. This has  resulted in greater consistency in instructional practices throughout the school and improved student outcomes.   Supportive Environment:   In the 2017-2018 school we continued the work that began in 2015 with the Leader in Me. The emphasis on adopting  the 7 Habits as a common language and integrating the Leader in Me concepts into lessons continued from previous  years. Our writing cluster program was strategically revamped to allow for a more integrated approach to social  emotional learning through academics. This resulted in deepening students’ understanding of the principles  associated with the Leader in Me and greater opportunities to make connections across topics.    In the upcoming school year, the key areas of focus will be as follows:   -use formative and summative assessments to craft and provide more targeted instruction to all students in the area  of math   -create more opportunities and structures to promote teacher leadership roles   -continue to use an evidence based program to promote social and emotional learning within the classroom through  explicit skills instruction   -use shared and distributive leadership structures to help build capacity and create more opportunities for innovation  and improvement   -increase opportunities for parent involvement and participation      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13                       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 10X077   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   0K,01,02,03,04,05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   358   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   YES   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Our school is committed to providing a safe environment in which the needs of the whole child are considered and  attended to in the process of educating our students. In our first year, we were able to begin the adoption and  installation of a School wide Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (SWPBIS). We established expectations  for different areas of the school, as well as classroom expectations and we developed structures for recognizing and  promoting positive behaviors through the globe points system. The impact of these measures has made it possible for  staff members to have clear and common expectations of student behavior, and have also allowed students to accept  responsibility for their behaviors.      Findings from the 2017-2018 School Quality guide reveal 92% positive feedback about the school’s safety while  indicators 1.4 and 3.4 in the 2016-17 Quality Review showed “Well Developed” practices in the elements related to  Supportive Environment.

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).  Our transition into Pre-Kindergarten and Kindergarten begins in January with school tours and information sessions.  Parents have the opportunity to visit the school, tour the facilities, visit classrooms while instruction is taking place,  and ask question about the school. After pre-registration is completed, parents are invited for an orientation session  at which we share school wide expectations, provide an overview of a typical day at Bedford Park Elementary School,  discuss the Dual Language program, and provide examples of student work at the beginning and end of the year.  Incoming students enrolling in Pre-Kindergarten and Kindergarten are screened using the Brigance Early Childhood  Inventory. This information includes a parent survey which provides us with deeper insight as to the students’ level of  readiness, and distinct need, which will be considered for curricula adjustments , early intervention needs, parent  workshops, and other events.         4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Each year, grade level teams are asked to review the assessments they administer to consider if the right content,  format, and expectations are being used within each assessment we administer. As a result of this grade level  analysis, we reach consensus (with final approval by administration) about what assessments to keep, remove, or add  to help us get a better picture of how and what students are learning.    The committees known as the Measures of Student Learning (MOSL), which is comprised of representatives from  each grade level, meets to discuss which assessments will provide us with the most meaningful and reliable data  regarding student achievement. The Professional Development committee, which is also comprised of teacher  representatives from each grade level and student subgroups will meet on a monthly basis to analyze data (i.e.  observation tracker reports, student work) to identify areas of need and implement strategies to promote  professional growth and student achievement.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46        Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Bedford Park Elementary School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I,  Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Bedford Park Elementary School will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., NCLB/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;      Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

From  Kindergarten to second  grade, our ELL population is comprised of  84 students that collectively  speak over 7 different languages at home. These languages include Spanish (66%), Bengali   (12%), Arabic (6%), Albanian (6%), Mandarin (2%), Urdu (2%) and Sonike (2%). As a dual  language school whose mission it is to prepare students to succeed in our global community, the  diversity in language and culture represented here serves as another opportunity to further enrich  the learning experiences and lives of all members of our community.     Title III funds will be used to provide a "Saturday Enrichment Program" once a month  from November to May, which will be open to all Kindergarten through 2nd grade ELL students,  from entering to commanding levels,  and their families, as well as an "After School Program"  Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays from November to May, to which a total of 50 ELL  students from 1st and 2nd grade will be invited to attend.  While the focus of the "After School Program" will be to  provide academic support to ELL  students, the "Saturday Enrichment Program" will serve as an enrichment program for both  students and their families. The rationale for this approach is that by doing so, we are able to  target students' academic and social needs in a manner that is more appealing, less intimidating  and provides multiple entry points to students with different learning modalities and interests.   All students identified as ELLs and their parents will be invited to attend the Saturday program.  Through partnerships with arts and  cultural organizations, such as Music for Many, and Studio  in a School,  ELL students and their families will receive an hour and a half of guided practice  and exposure to different art techniques and culturally enriching performances from 9 a.m. to  10:30 a.m. in a whole group setting  led by one ESL or Bilingual certified teacher and an arts  consultant. The cost of the program will be covered with Title III funds.  While the program will  focus on exposing students and their families to art and culture, through this experience we will  also promote language acquisition by building vocabulary and comprehension. Working on  content specific activities, students will be able to strengthen their listening, speaking, reading  and writing skills in English while acquiring content knowledge.   Our ESL/Bilingual teachers will use a variety of ESL methodologies to support the resident  artists and other facilitators.  Teachers will monitor students' progress using feedback forms  collected from each family, and observations.  Consultation fees and materials such as content  specific books, paper, notebooks, folders, art supplies will be covered with Title III funding  source . One supervisor will be assigned to oversee the Saturday program  Title III funding.      The "After School Program" will run from Wednesday to Friday, from 2:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m.,1  hour each day, for 10 weeks and will also focus on developing listening, speaking, reading and  writing skills in English for our ESL in 1st and 2nd grade.

In September, all classroom teachers in Pre-Kindergarten through second grade will be provided  with professional development in the form of a workshop that will provide teachers with more  information about the ELL identification process, proficiency levels and NYSESLAT  expectations based on grade bands. The purpose of this will be to orient classroom teachers as to  the different needs of  ELL students based on proficiency levels. This information will help  teachers further differentiate and target their instruction from the onset.Teachers will receive this  first training as part of the opening day information.  ESL teacher will attend other professional development sessions offered by the field support  center, and will turnkey the information to teachers of ELLs during after school trainings once a  month on Tuesdays from 3:30 to 4:30.  Topics will include how to distinguish between second  language acquisition and a learning disability, tools to engage ELLs in rigorous instruction,  and  providing targeted and strategic instruction to our ELLs.  Training will be open to our 14  teachers  (12 teachers K-2 and social studies and AIS teacher).  Dual language teachers will participate in an after school study group using  ReadyGen  Biliteracy Pathway Handbook. A total of 7 classroom teachers, one ESL teacher, and AIS  teacher, along with an administrator will take part in this study group for 1 hour once a week for  a total of 4 weeks from October 19th to November 16th.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  At Bedford Park Elementary School we use the Fountas and Pinnell benchmark assessment system in English  to assess the  early literacy skills of our ELLs. The Spanish version of this assessment is also administered to all students participating in the  dual language program.  This assessments provides information about the pre emergent reading skills students need in order  to be able to decode and read with accuracy and comprehension. When students demonstrate mastery of sub skills such as  concepts of prints, letter/sound recognition, phonemic awareness and high frequency words, they are then assessed using  running records to determine their independent reading levels.  In addition to these assessments, we also administer spelling inventory assessments using Words Their Way and Estrellitas.  The data is used by the school to determine what additional supports, and modifications will be needed in order for students  to access the curriculum. Based on this information we determine what parts of our reading instruction needs more emphasis  and plan instruction accordingly. Teacher use flexible grouping to provide instruction in reading and math, based on levels and  needs.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   A school wide assessment calendar is provided to every teacher. This calendar lists the assessment window dates, reporting  dates, collaborative grade meeting analysis dates , and progress monitoring dates.This structure provides guidance in planning  for the whole cycle of assessing for instructional purposes. Once the data is submitted, teachers meet in grade level teams  along with administrators to complete a Focus for Instruction Sheet which identifies target skills and 1-3 instructional  strategies for teaching each skill.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  In addition to student achievement data from teacher anecdotal records, checklists, rubrics and day to day student work and  performance that we see in the Freestanding ESL program, in the Dual Language program we also use data from both the SEL  and the Fountas and Pinnell BAS to evaluate success.  Beyond the quantitative measures we get from certain data, our school  also uses the Guiding Principles for Dual Language Education issued by the Center for Applied Linguistics to engage  in self- evaluation of the program.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    The school wide Response to Intervention team meets once a month to discuss cases that were brought up for review by  classroom teachers. Once baseline, benchmark and summative assessment data is reviewed and targeted instruction has been  provided in the classroom, teachers may refer students to the RTI/PPT for additional support through Tier 2 and 3 structures of  the RTI framework. Since we have ENL, special education, grade level teachers and other staff members on this team, we are  better able to make determinations about the needs and root causes of the students, and offer suggestions for additional  support inside the classroom or outside (through more intensive RTI support) based on our collective expertise.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Student achievement is always being monitored by the use of data. This data comes in many forms, both formative and  summative, and includes both academic and socio-emotional assessments. If an ELL, despite being serviced, is still seen to be  struggling either academically or socially, further interventions may be put in place. Data used includes examples of student  work, interviews with the students and his/her guardians, observations made by classroom teachers, results on exams or other  summative assessments, requests made by the parents or guardians, and a close examination of exactly what aspects of a task  a student is struggling with. Interventions include, but are not limited to, further one-on-one instruction, differentiated  grouping during lessons, smaller group environments, and home language guidance.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   As Bedford Park Elementary School data on ELL performance and needs is drawn primarily from the 2017 NYSESLAT results  and the incoming students’ NYSITELL scores. Keeping in mind that the vast majority of NYSITELL-eligible incoming students are  Kindergartens and hence take NYSITELL Level  I (which measures listening and speaking exclusively), data on reading and  writing is limited.  Other sources of data include Fountas and Pinnell levels and New York State Performance Task for math. From the NYSITELL  results, it is clear to see that the majority of our incoming ELLs struggle the most with speaking. Many students scored in the  middle range in listening but were unable to produce answers to many of the speaking questions.  In particular, all 6 incoming  ELLs who tested at Entering scored less than 3 points on the speaking portion of the NYSITELL.  Speaking also remained the  most difficult portion of the test for students who tested in at Transitioning. Expanding students had, for the most part, far  more balanced scores, but still struggled more with the speaking portion of the exam than the listening.Listening scores for  incoming ELLs were far more varied, with most students testing in as Entering or Transitioning receiving scores of 10/18 or  greater. Expanding students excelled at listening, many of them mere points shy of a perfect score, demonstrating a far  greater need for oral language and speaking support in these students. For our returning students who took the NYSESLAT last  year, listening and speaking remain the more challenging skills. Reading scores varied greatly, but the general trend shows  students on target to move towards Commanding. In particular, of the 7 students who scored either Expanding or   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61         Transitioning on the NYSESLAT, 6 already are within a commanding range for reading.  Emerging students’ scores ranged  widely but averaged at approximately a 12.7 raw score, which is on track to the score necessary to score Commanding. Only  students who tested again at Entering struggled with reading; in general, Entering level scores are low across the board, but  most especially in the area of speaking. Writing skills ranged from average for the level to higher than average, with many  students close to a Commanding level score even in much lower overall levels.  In particular, 3/5 Expanding students achieved  a Commanding score in writing, with 2/2 Transitioning students and 7/10 Emerging students not very far behind. Listening  scores were mixed across levels. It was the most difficult score for Expanding students, with only 2/5 at Commanding and  another 2/5 very off target. Similar results were seen in the Transitioning students, with ½ scoring Commanding and ½ scoring  far below. Both Emerging and Entering students expressed difficulty with listening, with scores generally many points below  Commanding.Speaking was again the most difficult skill, but it is important to note that 4/5 Expanding students scored at or  above the threshold for Commanding.  In all other NYSITELL levels, students generally scored much lower, with many students  scoring very low.        This data shows a need across ability levels to better support our ELLs with oral language and speaking  activities.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   At the beginning of the school year, as part of our cycles of Monday PLC's, ENL team meets with the staff to discuss the ENL  identification process, identify the ENL students in each class and share with teachers what the proficiency levels of each ENL  students in their respective classes are. Once that information is provided to teachers, they can proceed with differentiating  instruction according to the needs of students.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   t Bedford Park Elementary School, standalone ENL is administered to each grade level separately in order to best  tailor the lessons to what they are currently learning in class. Entering and Emerging students from each grade are  taken to a separate classroom for standalone instruction. Within these smaller groups, lessons are further  differentiated, with newcomer students receiving additional small group instruction within the lesson.As Bedford Park  Elementary School's ELLs are placed in general education classes, Integrated ENL takes place within the grade  teacher's classroom. Lessons are co-taught, using strategies that help ELLs understand the content, and then students  are grouped by ability. Using the flexible grouping model of instruction within each classroom, newcomer students  are sometimes put together to work on fundamental English skills; at other times, they may be grouped with stronger  students to model the desired skills and behavior for them. More advanced students are grouped together based on  need and ability. The ENL teacher works with each group extensively, ensuring all students are given the resources  needed to progress.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     na    c.  DL program.  If applicable.       Through the dual language program, students receive ENL support using the integrated approach.  Entering and  Emerging students receive 2 units of ENL instructional time per week (360 minutes). Transitioning and Expanding  Learners receive 1 unit of ENL instructional time per week (180 minutes). Finally, commanding learners continue to  receive  90 minutes per week for two years after they have become proficient. This is delivered using the alternating  day model in which on one day students receive a full day of instruction in the core content areas in  one language  and on the next day they switch to the other language for a full day of instruction .      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?                  At Bedford Park Elementary School, each classroom that holds students requiring services has integrated ENL classes a  minimum of four periods a week. As a period at Bedford Park Elementary School is 50 minutes long, this adds up to  approximately 200 minutes of integrated ENL a week per class, far over the minimum of 180 minutes required for Entering,  Emerging and Expanding students. As there are three classrooms at Bedford Park Elementary School that require services, this  adds up to 12 periods of integrated ENL a week. These integrated ENL classes are typically done in two period blocks of 100  minutes twice a week. In addition, Entering and Emerging students are taken out for standalone ENL classes four times a week  for 200 minutes a week. Entering students are required to have 180 minutes of standalone ENL a week, and Emerging students  are required to have 90; this 200 minute/week standalone ENL program also encompasses their 90 minutes of flexible time.  Students are grouped by grade in order for lessons to be tailored to the material covered in their classes and their curriculum;  Kindergarteners are seen four times a week and 1st Graders are also seen four times a week.  The ENL teacher comes to their  classroom to pick up the Entering or Emerging students and brings them into another classroom.  These are typically done in  one period blocks of 50 minutes four times a week. Bedford Park Elementary School does not have any former-ELL students as  of yet.         3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.    ENL: All lessons at Bedford Park Elementary School include a language objective. This helps focus the teachers and the  students in on the language necessary to understand the core content. These objectives are made explicit to the students so  they can understand what language they are going to be using and why. Visuals are extensively used to help bolster ELLs'  comprehension.  Students also benefit from hands-on activities to help cement core content through use of manipulatives or  experiments. Frequent checks for understanding help teachers recognize when a student has not understood the material as  presented and how to adjust the material to better serve that student. Students are also provided with materials in their own  language or at their own language ability -- "same content, different format."     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?         ENL students that speak Spanish are evaluated in their home language using Fountas and Pinnel in Spanish, Estrellitas and  Go Math in Spanish. Speakers of other languages, for which assessment materials are  available in print , who demonstrate  proficiency in the home language are provided with translated versions as available. Having people on staff that speak  Albanian, Bengali and Sonike has made evaluating students in their home language       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a) Bedford Park Elementary School does not currently have any SIFE students, but if we did, their instruction would include  vast amounts of basic school skills to ensure their proper social and emotional growth along with their academic growth.b)  Newcomer students are given extra time during both Standalone and Integrated ENL instruction with the ENL teacher. During  this time, they work on fundamental English skills, including extensive alphabet and vocabulary support.c) Developing ELLs  come in many different levels and abilities. These ELLs are grouped by need, as some may require more extensive speaking  practice while others may struggle with writing their alphabet properly.  Student work is assessed and groupings remain  flexible and temporary. In addition, mini lessons include activities that invoke each modality of the English language, ensuring  that students get both generalized English support and more personalized support as well.d) Bedford Park Elementary School  does not currently have any Long Term ELLs. If we did, a close examination of their work and social development would be   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63      conducted, including interviews with their parents and the student. We would determine which areas the student still needed  most support in and the student would be provided with additional support and instruction in those areas. We would also look  closely at their ability to perform similar tasks in their home language to determine whether it is an English-only deficit or  symptomatic of a larger linguistic barrier.e) Bedford Park Elementary School does not currently have any former ELLs, but if we  did, they would still receive their required 90 minutes of integrated ENL a week. The former ELLs would still be assessed  informally to ensure their language is still developing without the additional supports.       6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   ELL-SWDs are seen in much smaller groups than the rest of the ELL population; students are provided with the required testing  and instructional modifications. They are given manipulatives when possible and relevant and are presented material in  multiple different ways. Students are read aloud to, presented guided readings, and engaged in conversation over games or  art. Visuals are used extensively, as are songs and chants. Teachers also use these strategies to build schema before engaging  in a new topic or discussion to ensure that their students understand the context of a lesson before delivering it.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  All efforts are made to get to know the student well and to tailor the lessons to his/her unique needs; this may mean changing  the classroom environment to include a "cozy" space, carefully scheduling lessons around their therapy requirements, and  allowing access to the content from as many ways as possible. If a student cannot use a certain provided material due to their  disability, another one will be created or provided.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.   In addition to the targeted instruction provided through our differentiated instruction within the core program, our school  uses the Response to Intervention (RTI) model to provide targeted intervention to students identified as at risk using the  universal screenings which are administered at least three times a year.  The range of intervention services are as follows:- small group instruction in reading, writing and math in English and Spanish daily by classroom teachers-small group and one on  one support is provided outside of the classroom two times a week by academic intervention support person to students  identified as being at risk in English and Spanish as needed-after school program to focus on ELA and math three times a week  in English     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      In the upcoming school year we will offer a Saturday Academy to provide ELLs with additional language support.         10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   None.         11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  We ensure that ELLs have equal access to all school programs by incorporating the following:-equal participation in all core  curriculum programs, enrichment art programs and after school services-providing a curriculum that highlights and celebrates  diversity -offering differentiated instruction and multiple entry points within the curriculum -integrating features of the SIOP  model in every lesson plan-providing information to parents in multiple languages      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  - Core curriculum (Ready Gen and Go Math) include resources to target the needs of ELLs  -Estrellitas Phonics program used to provide support in native language arts for native Spanish speakers   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64      -Smartboard technology is consistently used throughout the school for daily instruction  -Access to leveled readers in English and Spanish through Reading a to z  -Spanish libraries in all dual language classrooms  -Native language support in the form of dictionaries and pictures in the most common languages         13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   ENL: Required paperwork is sent home in each student's home language. In addition, parent conferences are held with an  interpreter to ensure there are no breaks in understanding. Within the ENL classroom, each student's home language is  celebrated and respected, and students are encouraged to share their language with the class and each other. Resources, such  as dictionaries books,  and the buddy system are provided in the home language when available.  In dual language classrooms,  teachers provide instruction in the native language 50% of the time.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    The curriculum services at Bedford Park Elementary School use are tailored for the age and grade levels of our students. The  ENL classes are also based on the same curriculums, maintaining a link between their language classes and their mainstream  classes.        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    - Core curriculum (Ready Gen and Go Math) include resources to target the needs of ELLs  -Estrellitas Phonics program used to provide support in native language arts for native Spanish speakers  -Smartboard technology is consistently used throughout the school for daily instruction  -Access to leveled readers in English and Spanish through Reading a to z  -Spanish libraries in all dual language classrooms  -Native language support in the form of dictionaries and pictures in the most common languages   -Co-teaching model involves staff  from both schools  -School library is run between two staff members, one from each school and there is cross-articulation of needs and resources  -Campus meetings involving administrators from both teams occur on a monthly basis        16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   During the Pre-K and K application period the school offers tours for families interested in learning about our school. The tour  includes a brief overview from the principal describing our program and visits to classrooms.  In the spring time parents are  invited to an orientation during which time they receive more in-depth information about the school. In the summer families  are invited to a Family Fair at which time they get to meet and interact with the staff and community based organizations that  offer services to the school. Throughout the year our ELL coordinator and guidance counselor meet with parents to provide  further support and assistance with obtaining resources and information that can help them help their children.        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Bedford Park Elementary School does not currently offer language electives.        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65         Our dual language program is offered from Pre-Kindergarten to third  grade using a 50:50 self contained  model, alternating languages by day.  Following this model one teacher teaches both languages in the  same classroom using the alternate day model.  Languages are distinguished by color  using blue for  English and red for Spanish,  and are both represented in all subject areas.  Emergent literacy and all  other subjects are taught simultaneously. Entering and emerging ELLs receive standalone ENL instruction  on English days with the classroom teacher. Teachers meet as a grade level team to plan units of study  and subsequent lessons. Instruction is continued from one day to the next and  in order to do this  seamlessly, teachers rely heavily on the checks for understanding conducted throughout every lesson. Sp     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Best practices for teaching diverse learners have always been a focus of our professional development plan.  As part of our  Summer Instititute our teachers participate in training around using the SIOP model of instruction and other particulars of dual  language education. Throughout the year, our teachers take part in PD in the form of intervistation to other dual language  schools to observe best practices, forming study groups using professional resources that expose best practices for working  with second language learners , and engaging in collaborative planning. These sessions are facilitated by the principal, ELL  coordinator and other members of the PD committee. The school's ELL coordinator attends professional development sessions  provided by the Borough Field Support Center and the Office of English Language Learners.  The Ell coordinators then turnkey  the information to the rest of the staff.  During our Monday PLC's the staff engages in study groups focusing on a range of topics which often include ENL topics.In  addition to the PD provided in school, our dual language teachers participate in the Dual Language Program Professional  Development series offered by the NYC Division of English Language Learners and Student Support.  This year the school will work with consultants from Pearson and RBERN to provide further professional development.       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.    As per the Jose P. Compliance Monolingual teachers will receive ongoing professional development informing them of  preparations for the NYSESLAT. Teachers will be given information for ESL new teacher credits, ESL strategies and NYS  standards for ESL. Regular teachers receive 7.5 hours of instruction on ESL methodologies and Special Education teachers  receive 10 hours. In the ESL classroom, the ESL teacher maintains a professional resource library for teachers. These  professional development requirements will be met by attending a combination of in-house training and  workshops,  conducting inter visitations to other schools and participating in training offered by the Borough Field Support  Center as well as  the Department of English Language Learners and Student Support. Agendas and attendance  sheets are  maintained on file in the Principal's office. A letter is placed in their professional files when hours are completed.              2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66      Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Teachers will use the New York City Department of Education's Translation and Interpretation Unit as needed to ensure  accurate communication between teacher and parents. These meetings will involve all teachers necessary to accurately inform  the parents of their child's academic, linguistic, and socio-emotional development.      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Parents are invited to attend workshops around the following topics:  grade level expectations  providing homework help and other academic support at home  preparing for the NYSESLAT  using the Cool Culture Pass  Mental Health and Wellness  3.Parents are given a needs assessment at the beginning of the school year. This will help to know what our parents want to  know, how they can support the school and what expectations they have of our school.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, CAROLYN HEREDIA, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   BEDFORD PARK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL                                                                              School DBN: 10X077  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
