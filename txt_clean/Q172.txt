This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Our mission at Irwin Altman MS 172 is to make this school the educational center of this community. We envision the  parents, teachers, administrators and community organizations working together to provide a safe and secure  educational environment to ensure that all of our children meet and exceed the standards in all subject areas.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      Our shared beliefs reflect this mission statement. We believe that all children learn best when they are actively  engaged in a respectful, meaningful and rigorous curriculum that incorporates critical thinking skills and connects to  the real world.       2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Irwin Altman MS 172 is a grade 6-8 middle school located in the Floral Park section of Queens, a suburban area of  New York City approximately one half of a mile west of Nassau County. The school combines technology, a dedicated  and experienced staff and a student-centered middle school philosophy in order to achieve our goal of academic  excellence in a safe and supportive environment for all of our students. We celebrate a diverse student population  that includes 16.1% Hispanic students, 6.1.3% Asian students, 10.5% white students, 8.3% black students, and 1.1%  Pacific islander students and 1.5% American Indian, Alaskan Native, and 1.1% Multi-Racial students.    The sixth grade curriculum consists of Core (the integration of language arts, social studies, reading and literacy),  mathematics, science, general subjects which include art, instrumental music, vocal music, drama, and technology  and health and physical education. Classes emphasize academic exploration and experimentation in the development  of critical thinking. Even though middle schools are “departmentalized,” movement in grade 6 is reduced to provide  support for grade 6 students in the transition from elementary to middle school. The sixth grade is also where our  partnership Global Cities program is housed, allowing students to explore an internationally relevant theme and share  their work with global peers.    Students in all grades receive instruction in English Language Arts, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies, and in the  General Subjects. Many of our Grade 8 students receive credit toward their high school graduation by completing high  school level courses and passing the Regents examinations in Living Environment, and Algebra I and the NYC Foreign  Language Proficiency Test. (All grade 8 students are offered the opportunity to participate in the NYC Foreign  Language Proficiency Test.)   Two computer labs provide students with training in technology that ranges from basic computer and keyboarding  skills to advanced Computer Science concepts and skills with an emphasis on applied coding. Teachers further  integrate technology in content area classrooms through student use of laptop computers and iPads (with wireless  Internet connections,) interactive SmartBoards and document cameras. As part of the Chancellor’s “Equity and  Excellence” Initiative, classes will continue to incorporate explicit references to instructional technologies to facilitate  inquiry and/or other interdisciplinary topics in Computer Science for All. Students at MS 172 have participated and  have been awarded honors in the Games for Change Challenge for the past two years.   MS 172 is in its seventh year of partnership with the Urban Advantage Middle School Science Initiative which is  designed to improve students' understanding of scientific inquiry through collaborations between urban public school  systems and science cultural institutions. We are continuing a nine year partnership with Lincoln Center Jazz to  provide grade 8 students with curriculum-related cultural experiences. MS 172 students participate in the New York  State School Music Association competition and comprise 20% the Queens Borough Salute to Music Band Program. In  partnership with the Samuel Field Y, we are able to provide additional after school and holiday activities through the  Beacon program which operates in the school after 2:20pm, on Saturdays and during various school breaks. MS 172  also collaborates with various other arts institutions including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Queens Museum,  the New York Hall of Science, the Queens Farm and the Cooper Hewitt Museum to provide curricular and extra- curricular enrichment for all students.    In addition to our regular programs, we have a dedicated and expert teaching staff which spends many additional  hours with our students to work on diverse before and after school extra-curricular activities. Our Talented and Gifted  (TAG) after-school program, through generous fiscal support from the MS 172 PTA, provides enrichment through a  wide variety of academic and recreational classes including Debate (with a partnership with the American Debate   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      League), Digital Photography, Jazz Band, Electronic Keyboarding & Piano, Scrabble and Calligraphy, Math League,  SHSAT Prep and Chess.    We are also in our eighth year of a partnership with SAYA! (South Asian Youth Action,) in offering a Girls’ Leadership  Group, which has included a girl's coding class and a program emphasizing leadership through humor. In pursuit of  students’ physical well-being and the development of their collaborative skills, MS 172 is also continues an 11-year  partnership with the DOE C.H.A.M.P.S. program and provides before and after-school team & individual sports and  sports-related activities.    Teachers are in continued Professional Learning that focuses on alignment of all content curriculum to the Common  Core Learning Standards for Literacy in ELA and the Content Areas (Science, Social Studies, Technology and the Arts)  and for Mathematics to insure NYSLS-aligned curriculum. This now includes a continued focus on writing in all grades  through teacher's ongoing training in and implementation of Teachers College Writing and the NYC DOE Passport to  Social Studies program. Teachers facilitate the continuing development of Social-Emotional Learning through Sanford  Harmony, Brain Power, our PBIS program and the Yale RULER Emotional Intelligence program.    Parent involvement, engagement and empowerment is important at all stages of each student’s educational career.  MS 172 is fortunate to have an active and caring Parent Teacher Association which works in collaboration with our  Parent Coordinator to outreach to all parents and to plan informational forums and workshops on pertinent topics  that include Cyber-Safety, High School Choice and the NYS CCLS and classes in Parenting. The PTA supports the  curricular and extra-curricular programs at 172 through fund-raising and providing parent volunteers at many special  events. Through a collaboration with the instructional staff and Parent Coordinator, MS 172 offers workshops for  parents toward advancing adult learning in the MS 172 community including computer skills.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   English Language Learners at the 5 different NYSITELL/NYSESLAT levels (Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding  and Commanding,) in all grades receive English a New Language instruction as per their ENL mandates toward  achieving and advancing proficiency in English. Service to these students is through both push-in, pull-out and  integrated models to optimize all students’ achievement. Through our SETSS, Self-Contained, Integrated Collaborative  Teaching and Related Services programs, MS 172 supports all students with special needs with attention to specific  student needs through Specially Designed Instruction.    In the 2018-19 school year, the MS 172 Gifted and Talented (G&T) program will continue with nine classes in the 6th  through 8th grades, including one “Twice Exceptional” G&T/ICT in grade 6, 7 and 8. The G&T/ICT classes provide  equity and access to a rigorous accelerated program for gifted learners utilizing appropriate research-based strategies  to address the individual needs of each gifted learner, including gifted learners with disabilities. All ICT classes provide  the supports need for SWDs to access rigorous curriculum in a general education setting. Qualified students (based on  multiple criteria,) may be enrolled in our Gifted and Talented or Specialized Progress (SP) program starting at grade 6.  Grade 8 students in a SP and GT class are enrolled in accelerated courses in Regents Living Environment and Regents  Algebra I.    For students who need targeted support, the MS 172 Academic Intervention Services (AIS) program is designed for  students who are academically at-risk, as well as to assist students in reaching proficiency, and/or remaining at or  above standards in ELA, mathematics, Science and Socially Studies.       4.

A review of NYS Test data for spring 2018 indicates that student proficiency on the Grades 6-8 ELA test has been  maintained with increases from 2016 to 2017 of 5.2% for all students and from 2017 to 2018 of 6.9% for all students -  a gain of 12.1 % over the past two year span. For all grades SWDs demonstrated a 0.5% decrease in achievement in  ELA, however ELLs demonstrated a 12% increase in ELA performance. (Both a continued area of focus.)   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      Similarly, a review of the 2018 NYS Math test scores indicated 0.83 % gain for all students from 2017 to 2018 and a  two year gain (for all students) of 2.63%. SWDs demonstrated a Performance increase of 4.8 % (Levels 3 and 4,)  although ELLs demonstrated a 0.9 decrease in performance. (area of focus.)   In the NYCDOE 2017-18 School Quality Guide, MS 172 demonstrated continued strengths and/or gains in Rigorous  Instruction, Collaborative teachers and Strong Family and Community Ties. 2017-18 feedback includes that teacher  teams are structured to allow teachers to focus on instructional work anchored to the school's instructional agenda,  hiring practices ensure positive impacts on school programs and on students' needs, the arts program is  comprehensive and allows students to choose from various interest and deepen their own work in specific areas (  with MS 172 being celebrated in the NYCDOE 2015-16 Arts in Schools Report,) parents feel welcome and appreciate  the experiences the school has put forth and that the school has put forth a risk-free environment for their children to  learn and grow.   Based on a review of the PPO Written Feedback of 2017-18 review observations and other school data, MS 172 has  identified the need to continue to build on an instructional focus and priorities that ensure that there is coherence in  the policies and practices across the school, such that the curricula is engaging, rigorous and is accessible for all  learners in all subject areas, that tasks meet the cognitive demands of students and are aligned to content  standards/NYSLS and include the instructional shifts to promote college and career readiness, that there high and  equal levels of expectations for all students that are evidenced by instructional decisions and opportunities for  increased students learning and ownership of that learning, that systems support monitoring and feedback to  teachers to ensure multiple types of teacher and student assessment of meaningful work and the growth of a  sustainable culture of mutual trust and positive attitudes that supports the academic and personal growth of students  and adults.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 26Q172   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   978   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     Based on a review of the 2017-18 School Quality Guide, PPO Written Feedback (2017-2018) and the school’s MOTP  end-of-year summative ratings, MS 172 will continue to build on the present instructional focus of using student data  to inform instructional strategies and provide high quality supports to deepen student engagement through multiple  entry points and for students to make their complex thinking visible.    According to the NYSED School report card, 2016 and 2017 your school did not make AYP in both ELA for Hispanic and  SWD and Math for Black, Hispanic, White and SWD populations.    A review of the Quality Review Measures for the Effectiveness of Teaching & Learning (1.2) revealed a score of 3.5  which earned a proficient rating. Looking deeper at the related data from the 2017-18 School Quality Guide survey  showed through the 66% of positive responses to the Framework Element of Rigorous Instruction (scoring a 3.02) and  a decrease of 0.89 from last year's data. Other response rates included:   Common Core Shifts in Literacy      86% of social studies/ science/ELA teachers say that they had the resources to include opportunities for   students to interact with academic language.     75% of teachers of all subjects say that they had the resources to include opportunities for building students'   knowledge through content rich non-fiction.   Common Core Shifts in Math     86% of teachers of all subjects say that they had resources to focus deeply on the concepts emphasized in the   standards to help students build strong foundations for learning.      80% of teachers of all subjects say that they had the resources to link the standards from previous grades to   current grade so student knowledge/skills build onto previous learning as foundations for math concepts.   The school will continue to strategically use data to guide instruction and strengthen the use of common assessments  to determine student progress towards goals across all subject areas. In the area of Engaging Students in Learning,  overall MOTP ratings indicate 17% of ratings were Developing, 70% were Effective, and 13% ratings were Highly  Effective for Danielson component 3C. Aligned to the feedback from the 2017 PPO feedback which cited  "inconsistencies in assessment practices in how teachers use formative assessment data to make effective  adjustments...", the 2017-18 MOTP data also indicated that there were 12% of ratings were Developing, 68% were  rated Effective, and 19% of Highly Effective ratings for Danielson component 3D.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14       Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

Through researched-based decision–making (Leverage  Leadership The Principal-Three Keys to Maximizing Impact  ) and other titles) the principal and other school leaders  identify key pedagogical personnel for support and  guidance toward professional advancement with  opportunities to demonstrate emerging leadership skills.   School  leaders;  teachers;  school staff;  students                        School leaders, in collaboration with teachers, identify  professional learning opportunities that further enhance  effective and highly effective teacher practice and/or  provide professional learning in areas for additional skills  and knowledge to include in a yearlong Professional  Learning calendar to include an analysis of observed  teacher practice to specifically provide individually  differentiated support where needed with an emphasis on  executing best practices and recommendations with  fidelity.       Teachers are provided with ongoing scheduled time to  collaborate in vertical, horizontal and interest-based  teacher teams to develop skills and design coherent  instruction to provide for the needs of all students, with a  priority focus on SWDs and ELLs.

The principal implements a plan of distributive leadership  that includes other school leaders and teachers.    August 2018-June  2019      The principal meets with the Student Organization  Executive Board monthly to listen to student concerns and  ideas for changes in the school to ensure student voice.   School leaders, teachers and support personnel,  collaborate on decision-making to provide the most  appropriate and least restrictive environment for SWDs  and ensure English Language Learners receive the same  curriculum as their non-English language learner peers  enhanced with appropriate resources, strategies, and  interventions.   Teachers' decisions toward professional learning are  actively solicited and honored; students, through a  representative Student Organization, surface their ideas  and are provided a formal forum in which to share their  thinking and work collaboratively and respectfully for  change.    Shared decision-making is made transparent at School  Leadership Team meetings through providing SLT  members with information documents toward the  creation and revision of the CEP and budget alignment to  schools goals. SLT meeting information is shared publicly  with the school community through the SLT report at PTA  meetings and posted SLT minutes.    School leaders will continue and increase conversations  with students (continued implementation of the "Kid  Watching" protocol,) to explore student perceptions of  teachers and instructional practices in their classrooms to  provide timely informal feedback to teachers to support  instructional practice that ensures consistent and  challenging work that meets the needs of all students.   School leaders continue to monitor this work that is taking  place by teams of teachers to check in and on scheduled  cycles and progress to help support the teams to focus  their work and ensure it is directed to the mastery of goals  for groups of students.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Column B   Verify with an (X)   Section Reference(s)   Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local                                                  1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. MS 172, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      Irwin Altman MS 172 will support parents and families by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community.      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s academic program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Parent Involvement Policy, parents of participating students, parent members of the school’s Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were  consulted on the proposed Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input. To  increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s  academic program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan,    ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the funds, which are allocated directly to the school to  promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as described  in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team and the  Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association.) This includes providing technical support and ongoing  professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      ● conduct an Annual Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and workshops  that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams and Parent Association (or Parent- Teacher Association.)   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.   ● increasing cultural awareness through communication with community organizations (e,.g.

The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.   Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs.  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.     Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high  academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.   1.  2.  3.  4.  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on  the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”   1.   Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term  workshops and conferences.    Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet  community needs.    1.   These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.      NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional  development, and 20% to OTPS.

The direct  instruction program will run for twenty-four weeks under the Title III Program which allows the  time and opportunity for students to develop as English language speakers, listeners, readers,  writers and productive members of general education classrooms.  Current testing data results show that we have roughly 9% Entering and Emerging ELLs, 21%  Transitioning ELLs, 39% Expanding ELLs, and 35% Commanding ELLs. Many ELLs, at all  levels, have scored at level 1 or 2 on the NYS ELA and Math exams, with some scoring low  level 3s. This underscores the need for continued problem solving development and math  vocabulary acquisition, as well as the development of stronger sight word vocabulary and  reading stamina.  In addition, most of our students struggle with projects and homework because of  English  language acquisition needs. Our Title III after-school program, therefore, will target the specific,  as well as the common, needs of our ELL population for 24 weeks . The program is scheduled to  run after school on Thursdays, beginning in the middle of October 2018 through the end of May  2019, for 1.5 hours per session.  This unique course titled Tutoring I, will assist students'  comprehension of core math, ela, social studies, and science content, and continue to build  students' language proficiency across these disciplines . Tutoring I will be open to all ELLs  currently receiving ENL services, however inquiry and direct instruction will target low  performing ELLs.  The Tutoring I course will be led by an ENL/Math teacher and two content area teachers (to be  determined based on teacher interest and availability).  Students will come to the class prepared  with clarifying questions or questions to further their analysis of content area topics.  Students  will meet the expectations of general education classes while developing the language needed to  convey their learning through activities designed by the ENL/Math and content teachers. Access  to teacher selected and teacher-created content specific materials including textbooks, trade  books, newspapers. The materials are distinct from those used throughout the regular  instructional day. In addition, home language dictionaries and glossaries (both in hard copy  versions and accessed through web based applications using iPads and laptops) will be used  for translating documents into students' home languages when necessary.  The use of portable  devices will allow students to make strategic use  digital media to enhance discussions and  presentations of findings, reasoning and evidence, and to add interest .  Accessing multiple  sources of digital media will enable students to make more meaningful justifications and to better  understand content specific topics.  English language learners will use iPads and laptops to  access translated documents, literature and translator applications.  A strong and strategic focus will be on the close study and application of  academic vocabulary,  especially that embedded within state tests. To this end, the building of academic vocabulary will  be fostered through explicit teaching in context, the use of student-maintained academic  dictionaries/glossaries, and the practice of student-led accountable talk. In addition, language  objectives targeting key academic terms and language structures will be incorporated into lessons  by all participating teachers.

Students' progress in the Tutoring I course will be monitored through observations, conferences,  portfolios, journals, assessment of student work, or any combination of these. The three teachers,  ENL/Math teacher and two content area teachers, will provide professional development for  strategy-specific instruction by collaborating on a bi-weekly basis for a total of ten sessions. For  this program students will receive notification and description of the course available as well as  meeting days and times and a program calendar for future planning. Notification will be sent  home in English and in high incidence languages which include Arabic, Chinese, French, Haitian  Creole, Spanish and Urdu available from the translation unit. Paraprofessional translators will  translate notifications into Hindi, Punjabi and Bengali.   Parents can call the school and speak  with an ENL teacher, in English or Spanish, or a paraprofessional in Hindi, Punjabi or Bengali  regarding notifications. For Arabic, Chinese, French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Urdu and  over 200 more languages,  parents will be asked to come in for an appointment and the  translation unit will be utilized at 1-855-249-9103 or 1-800-231-0288.    Teachers, in this program, will maintain attendance records to be used as data for future planning  and as supporting evidence when discussing student success. These records along with student  progress reports and correspondences with parents and classroom teachers will be kept in the  course folder until the completion of the program, at which time they will be moved to the  student's portfolio where applicable. The intended results at the completion of the Title III  program are listed below.  ELL students will be able to:  ·  minimal errors, as observed by teachers, parents and peers.  ·  English, as measured by teacher observations and task specific rubrics.  ·  write routinely over extended time frames (time for reflection and revision) and shorter  time frames (a single sitting or a day or two) for a range of discipline-specific tasks, purposes,  and audiences, as observed by ENL and content area teachers and peers.   ·  information, strengthen&nbsp;claims and evidence, and add interest with the use of  iPads&nbsp;and Chromebooks, as measured by the Title III teachers and classroom teachers.  The Chromebooks&nbsp;will be labeled for Title III use.

Teachers will provide  professional development for strategy-specific instruction for a total of ten 45-minute sessions  that will take place on a bi-weekly basis.  The sessions will begin in Oct 2018 and continue  through May 2019. The ENL and content area teachers will discuss strategies to target areas of  need for supporting our ELLs in meeting learning outcomes.  Topics will include selection of  instructional materials, instructional strategies for ELLs ,  assessment of ELLs, using informal  and formal data to drive instruction.  Teachers will also work together to address students'  academic needs and collaborate for supportive content area instruction with a strong focus on  strategies to enhance grade-specific academic vocabulary acquisition.  Additionally, instructional  staff will participate in professional development provided by ENL staff developers on-site and  off-site to be determined by MS 172 staff availability and identified PD programs.  The MS 172 ENL teachers will also attend the on-going ELL workshops provided by the Queens  North Field Borough Support Center at no cost to Title III. Teachers will share effective  methodologies and teacher strategies learned at these workshops with fellow content area  teachers at department meetings, planning sessions, and during Monday professional  development times.  Our school focus this year is to continue to build capacity with all staff in  supporting our ELLs' learning and to increase their academic vocabularies across disciplines.

NOTE: These are in addition to mandated activities, such as  parent orientation during ELL identification process.    ·  ·  ·  ·  ·  Begin description here:             There is a direct correlation between students’ success and parental involvement; the latter can  often be a strong predictor of the former. Studies have shown that increased positive parental  involvement often results in a higher student success rate. In order for the parents/guardians of  ELLs to successfully assist their children, they need to better understand the scope of the  academic demands placed upon them, and the difficulties their children often encounter while  learning academic content and a new language simultaneously. They also need to learn ways to  assist their children with learning. To better prepare parents/guardians to help their children meet  with success, we will hold three parent workshops throughout the school year. Each workshop  will run for one and a half hours and be facilitated by three certified ENL teachers: Ms. Sarno,  Ms. Smith, Ms. Rocchio. Written materials will be provided in the respective native languages  available through the school or DOE Translation and Interpretation Unit.  Efforts will also be  made to provide translators for the workshops for all the languages represented in the population  being served in the program. When a low incidence language translator is unavailable, the  NYC DOE Translation hot line will be utilized to address the specific need of that parent. All  correspondence pertaining to these workshops will be translated using the NYC DOE Translation  Unit in the respective languages of students.  The first workshop- ELL Expectations & Tools for  Learning-  to be held in October 2018 will help parents understand the new state standards, give  an overview of the expectations for ELLs throughout the academic year, and introduce  parents/guardians to the various tools for learning used at our school including: PupilPath, the  school wide web application designed to monitor student progress, Achieve 3000, IXL Reading,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57         Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    IXL Math. Parents will be given the opportunity to register for PupilPath accounts, if needed,  and peruse the site to become more familiar with its use as both a progress monitoring and a  communication tool.  Teachers will explain and demonstrate how students use programs such as  Achieve 3000, IXL Math & Reading, and Google Classroom to increase their learning, and how  these tools can be used at home as well as on portable devices.  Using Chromebooks labeled for  the Title III program, parents will have the opportunity to log into demo accounts and experience  the interactive lessons and applications in these programs as their children do. This will enable  parents/guardians to experience firsthand how these programs work to support their children's  learning, and encourage them to better assist their children's academic growth at home. Parents  will also be provided with materials and instructional strategies to help prepare students to  succeed on the standardized state tests for Math, ELA, and the NYSESLAT. The second  workshop- Salvadori STEM Paper Bridges Family Workshop - to be held in January 2019, will  be an onsite professional experience enhancing the work students will be doing in the Tutoring  after school Title III program.  In this project-based learning experience, parents and students  will collaborate to use critical math and science concepts to build and test various versions of  paper bridges. This workshop will give our students the opportunity to put real world critical- thinking skills into practice, while simultaneously supporting their academic vocabulary in the  math and science disciplines.  During the third workshop - Summer Enrichment and Avoiding  the Summer Slide- to be held in June 2019, parents will receive information regarding the NYC  Title III Summer Enrichment Program in addition to strategies and materials to help their  children continue their English language learning throughout the summer.  All records including  correspondences with parents, notifications, and attendance will be maintained by the ENL  teachers to be used for future planning and to share with administration and faculty/staff.   MS 172 is a collaborative effort to prepare students for entrance into the many high schools  throughout our city.  Beginning in the seventh grade, students are given the opportunity to apply  to various schools of choice in continuance of their secondary education. To simplify this often  overwhelming task for both students and parents, a series of informational High School  Application workshops will be offered to which parents/guardians of ELLs will be invited and  encouraged to attend (dates TBD). The three workshops -Understanding the High School  Application Process, Meet the High School Principals, and High School Prep 101 - will assist  parents/guardians of ELLs to understand and navigate the entire application process. During  these times, parents can work one-on-one with teachers and administrative staff to better  comprehend the myriad choices they have for their children's continued education. During  the Meet the High School Principals workshop, principals of many of the local high schools will  be present to speak to parents about their schools and answer any questions they may have.  Translators representing the languages of our ELLs' families will be available, and the  NYCDOE Translation Unit hot line will be utilized as needed. Parents will also have the  opportunity to meet with our school's guidance counselors, both at the workshops, and separately  as requested to assist them in the application process.   Additionally, to celebrate our cultural diversity, M.S. 172 will hold a Multicultural Night in the  spring, date to be determined. Parents will be invited to attend along with their children. During  this evening, parents and students will be able to view performances and sample foods from  different cultures.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58   Part E: Budget   FOR SCHOOLS NOT CONCEPTUALLY CONSOLIDATED ONLY.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  There are several formative assessments that are used to guide instructional planning for English language learners (ELLs) such  as teacher observations, teacher made assessments, student class work and discussions, and periodic assessments created  specifically for ELLs by the New York City Department of Education.  There are also several online educational programs that  we utilize as well, such as Achieve 3000, which provide teachers and administrators with Lexile scores and other  data.  Reviewing the data of these assessments reveals multiple insights such as possible students with interrupted formal  education (SIFE), for which further investigation is needed, and stud ents with more unique learning needs, for which further  evaluation would be conducted. Data analysis can determine homogeneous grouping to target students’ specific needs. The  ENL teacher will also inform the ELLs' content area teachers of their findings, so that proper grouping and differentiation of  instruction can be designed.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62         ENL teacher-led workshops during Monday Professional Development time and on Chancellor Conference days, where  pertinent data is shared to help guide instructional planning.Ongoing articulation with content-area teachers regarding best  practices for ELLs and specific student needs face-to-facethrough emailScheduled collaborative planning with co-teachers for  Integrated ENL servicesface-to-faceemailwritten communicationContent area teachers access online educational programs  and use the data for planning differentiated instruction for ELLs     3.

How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63         Best efforts are made to group ELLs by level into general education classes so that the majority of ELLs in a given class  are of the same proficiency level.  Therefore the general education class contains at or about 1/3 ELLs. Integrated  instruction is delivered by the ENL and content area teacher within a given content area class based on scheduling,  and programmed according to student levels and CR Part 154.  Extra support is given to students with needs beyond  the minutes and requirements (in the form of Extra Help lunch sessions, additional integrated or standalone  instruction if possible based on ENL teacher and student schedule).  Standalone instruction is implemented based on  student's level and CR Part 154 in the ENL classroom with the ENL teacher.  All efforts are made to group students by  proficiency levels and grade levels so that the majority of the class is the same grade level, or two consecutive grade  levels (6&7 or 7&8), and same or similar levels of proficiency (All entering, or all beginners (Entering &  Emerging)).  ELLs with disabilities are also integrated into standalone ENL classes.      b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A     c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A    2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Using the CR Part 154 Units of Study and Staffing Requirements table, the mandated number of instructional minutes,  integrated and standalone, are provided to ELLs based on their level of English language proficiency as identified by the  NYSITELL or NYSESLAT.Student minutes for Integrated and Stand Alone instruction is programmed in STARS; compliance  reports are analyzed and adjustments are made if necessary.In the Standalone model, ENL teachers focus on language  objectives that will aid students in becoming better readers, writers, speakers and listeners when in all English classes.In the  Integrated model, ENL teachers provide differentiated materials and scaffolds such as visual vocabulary, home language  translations and modified assignments so that students can achieve the goal of the class.  ENL and content area teachers co- plan so that the instructional outcome can be matched with language objectives that will help the student be successful.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Based on the Freestanding ENL program model, students receive instruction in English with native language supports, in  general education classes (integrated) and standalone ENL classes.  The ENL teacher uses a thematic approach.  It is inter- disciplinary and contains academic and content-specific vocabulary, grammar, phonemic awareness, and functional language  components.  In order to make content comprehensible, foster language development, and meet the demands of the  ESSA standards, classrooms are rich in print and teachers uses various instructional methods, such as:  flow and reference  charts created and displayed in the classroom for student reference, bilingual dictionaries and content glossaries, materials in  native languages (when available), strategic homogeneous linguistic groupings, NLAP progressions for scaffolds related to each  content grade level standard, ENL methodology and instructional strategies, ENL strategic instruction, teacher collaboration in  content areas, native language libraries (when available), technology enrichments in Native languages, buddy systems.  Scaffolds such as bridging, modeling, schema building, contextualization, text re-representation,  and metacognitive development are all used to foster language development and to meet the demands of the  ESSA standards.     In stand Alone ENL classes, ENL teachers implement ENL methodologies and instructional strategies, and literacy programs and  curriculums, such as the Teachers College Reading and Writing Project, Code X, EngageNY units of study, Pearson's Keystone  and Keys to Learning Curriculum, Elizabeth Claire's Easy English News, LearningA-Z.com (grade 6), to engage students in  learning.  ENL teachers design lessons which allow ample opportunities for students to engage in discussions and reading and  writing activities, which include but are not limited to reading comprehension strategies, reading fluency, reading of complex  texts, writing strategies, composition of writing, grammar, sentence structure and figurative language. Hands-on activities,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64      visuals, realia, graphic organizers, and drawings are used to scaffold the learning.  A print-rich environment is maintained,  including a word wall with content and functional language and definitions. The ENL teacher also differentiates instruction so  that students are able to meet their individual goals.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      Native language tests provide an equal footing for student performance.  Students are provided with content area glossaries  (from NYU Steinhardt and teacher made glossaries for lower incidence languages) for daily use including during all class room  and state assessments.  Students are also provided with native language human translators on the state Math and Science  assessments when a printed translated assessment is not available. For math and science classroom assessments students are  encouraged to use digital translators when necessary. Teacher observations and student to teacher conferences indicate how  proficient ELLs are in their home languages throughout the year.  Past data and patterns shows that most ELLs in our schools  only speak their home language but do not read or write in their home language.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a. SIFE students are given the required amount of ENL periods, as well as additional small group instruction by the licensed  ENL teacher.  Reading interventions focusing on sight words and phonics are implemented.  The essential 500 High Frequency  words assessment (Milton Jackson, 1985) is administered to identify if they need to learn decoding skills and to determine if  they may require the use of a reading intervention program. Online reading software (e.g. Raz-Kids.com- grade 6) is utilized in  a small group setting with the guidance of the ENL teacher. Instruction focuses on decoding, encoding, and vocabulary  development skills. After school functions such as one-to-one Peer Tutoring, AIS, Title III and Beacon programs are strongly  encouraged.       b. For the newcomer, an interview is administered so that ENL teachers can learn more about the student and to assess their  level of English language (speaking and listening).  Instruction is differentiated by providing scaffolds such as cloze sentences  and paragraphs, word banks and glossaries that include definitions and native language translations, visual vocabulary, visual  literacy, sentence starters, visuals, audio text when available, differentiated texts (novels, books, articles), multimedia,  abbreviated assignments, modified grading and modified rubrics.     c. For developing ELLs, students receive majority of instruction in the general education classroom therefore differentiation  and scaffolds are extremely important, and a gradual release of support is implemented by teachers.  Differentiation includes  modified assignments, extended time and level of support. Scaffolds include cloze paragraph and text responses, thinking  maps, and native language supports.     d. For long-term ELLs, data is used to identify patterns of progress or lack thereof, and appropriate interventions are then  planned.  Interviews with students and parents are conducted to determine more about the students' learning and their  progress in developing their native language, which may affect or give insight into their learning of English.  Long terms  ELLs receive instruction based on their level of English language proficiency as outlined by CR Part 154.  Long term ELLs are also  given "at-risk" support to aid in their learning.  Support is offered throughout the school day as additional standalone ENL  periods (whenever possible), extra help sessions during lunch, after school AIS (if the student qualifies) and Title III  supplemental support. In the classroom, teachers differentiate by providing modified assignments and rubrics, leveled texts,  graphic organizers, and other scaffolds based on the current level of English language proficiency.        e. ELLs that perform Commanding on the NYSESLAT are given two additional years of support as outlined by the CRPart 154  Units of Study Tables. This support is provided by the ENL teachers in the content area classes. Students are also provided with  testing accommodations such as translated exams, verbal translators, and NYS developed content area translated glossaries,  as well as time and a half on timed exams.  Students are also given scaffolds in their general education classes. Such scaffolds   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65      include, but are not limited to, visual vocabulary and key terms, and advanced graphic organizers and outlines. All scaffolds are  used on an individual basis to help students meet the NYS and ESSA standards.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   All of the following materials provide differentiated levels of text-complexity and scaffolds to provide access to academic  content areas and to accelerate English language development for ELL-SWDs.    Scaffolds are provided based on Individual Education Plans as outlined in SESIS such as:     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  ELL-SWDs are accessed annually, or more as deemed necessary, and the CSE meets to discuss the academic, social and  language development needs of each student.  An appropriate least restrictive environment, which includes flexible  scheduling, is then planned to best meet the unique learning needs of the student.  During ENL sessions, the ENL teachers use  the ELL-SWD's IEP goals and management needs to personalize instruction.  ENL services are programmed according to CR Part  154 and teachers collaborate to provide FAPE.          8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  MS 172 is fortunate to be able to provide varied targeted intervention programs to the ELL population. Federal Title III funding  provides for the following extra courses which are all delivered in English as part of our Freestanding English Language  Instruction:     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      New Common Core aligned textbooks entitled Language Power which are based on differentiated non-fiction units will be  used.  This program includes three textbooks that have identical units and scope and sequence, but are separated by beginner,  intermediate and advanced levels of instruction.  These new materials will help align instruction and create more  heterogeneous groupings.  A Learning A-Z license will also be used for our sixth grade ELLs as a pilot program, offered by the  Division of English Language Learners and Student Support.  This program has an extensive collection of incredibly powerful  and flexible curriculum resources which ENL teachers can use to deliver differentiated instruction.  This program has an ELL  component which helps support all modalities of English language acquisition and provides materials and tools that support  the development of the English language.     Data and trends show that immigrant students who perform Commanding on the NYSITELL need some level of support  transitioning into core content classes, and because they are not native English speakers, these students need support in  refining their written and spoken language skills.  Student data, including classroom teacher observations, student work,  classroom assessments, and state assessment scores, show that these immigrant students would benefit from support-  beyond the CR Part 154 mandated minutes - from the ENL teachers at least one time per week, with a gradual release of  support as students progress.            10.

Numerous varied instructional materials are used to support our ELLs including:     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Home language proficiency is assessed through an interview with the student when he/she first enrolls at MS 172Q and at the  beginning of each school year by the ENL teachers.  Through the ENL model, students who are able to read and write in their  home language are given bilingual content specific glossaries from NYU. Additional scaffolds are provided such as translated  texts, verbal translation, and translated exams.  Bilingual dictionaries and visual vocabulary with native language translations  are in the ENL classrooms as reference materials to make content more accessible.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All required services and resources are aligned to support the school curriculum and state standards in each content  area.  Reading materials are translated into the student's native language, when students demonstrate the ability to read and  write in their native language, or are presented on a reading level that is appropriate to the ELL's  English level proficiency to  make the content accessible. To help facilitate student to participation in the ELA curriculum and to conduct research with  their peers, classroom libraries contain high-interest, low-readability, age-appropriate independent reading books.  Online  programs such as Achieve 3000, IXL, and LearningA-z.com also offer leveled texts so that students can access meaningful  reading materials and skill building activities (IXL).     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    N/A     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Intranet checklist for successful yearENL teachersSummer in the City programs offered by the DOE  by DOE employeesThis  program is for all ELLs and provides instruction in English throughout the summer in preparation for the upcoming school year.  Notification is sent home to parents in native languages or with a 'translate stamp'  and ENL teachers explain the program to  the students.At the beginning of the school year parents of newly enrolled students are asked to attend an orientation  meeting where many resources are made available to them, such as PupilPath, which are explained by the ENL  teachers.Phone-in translator conferences are utilized when needed.Parents without insurance are directed to contact 311 in  order to obtain the necessary medical attention the family needs. The Parent Coordinator also connects parents with Metro  Plus, which may provide no or low cost health care insurance depending upon the parents’ qualifications. Parents are given  direction to the three closest libraries in the neighborhood and the district elementary location - P.S. 26 -  where English  classes are offered after school and on Saturdays and Sundays by ENL teachers and Parent Coordinator. Other after school  opportunities such as, Beacon, Title III and C.H.A.M.P.S are described to parents at the beginning of the school year or as  students enroll by the Pupil Secretary and Parent Coordinator. When available, new students are assigned a buddy who speaks  their language to help them navigate and acclimate to their new school surroundings.            17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    MS 172 provides Spanish courses for the 7th and 8th grade ELLs.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.

N/A        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The ENL teachers attend numerous workshops and conferences throughout the school year.  Professional development  workshop opportunities offered by New York City Department of Education and from the Division of English Language Learners  and Student Support are sent to the principal and screened for relevance to the field of ENL. Topics include ENL scaffolds and  instructional techniques and informational meetings that pertain to compliance and important information that the ENL  coordinator and teachers must know in order to maintain best practices.  All staff are informed of any workshops pertaining to  incorporating the common core learning standards and the instruction of ELLs through email from the principals. ENL teachers  plan and present professional development sessions to all staff at least twice per year.  Non-pedagogic staff also attend ELL  specific workshops offered by Queens North Field Support Center which includes titles for Pupil Accounting Secretaries and  Guidance Counselors and the UFT Headquarters.      2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  We ensure that all teachers of ELLs receive the minimum of 15% total hours and ELL teachers receive 50% total hours of  professional development specific to the needs of ELLs annually. This is achieved through multiple opportunities.  At the  beginning of the school year, the Professional Learning Committee (PLC) meets to discuss and plan the various required and  desired instructional topics that support the needs of the staff in order to better service students in all subgroups, including  the ENL population. All professional learning classes are carefully selected to ensure focus is on best practices for integrating  language and content instruction for our English language learners. The constituents (who represent multi-disciplines and  grade levels) devise a Professional Learning (PL) plan for the in-house weekly Monday 80-minute Professional Learning  sessions. After each PL topic is determined it is recorded into a digital file (i.e. Excel spreadsheet) that is categorized into the  following areas: Topic/Purpose; Presenter; Audience; Alignment to Instructional Focus; Alignment to Quality Review;  Alignment to Danielson’s Framework for Teaching; and Alignment to Framework for Great Schools. In addition,  our school encourages ENL and all content-area teachers to attend off-site ENL-related workshops offered by the DELLSS,  Queens North Field Support Center, and or school districts throughout the city. Through such, ENL teachers attend a series of  Common Core Aligned Writing Strategies workshops which focuses on strategies and practices to enhance the writing skills of  our English language learners.  In addition, our  three certified ENL teachers present a series of ENL workshops for all content- area teachers throughout the school year which provides ideas and strategies dedicated to language acquisition in core  content area instruction, best practices for co-teaching, and the integration of language and content instruction for our ELLs.  All on-site and off-site professional learning is tracked in a Professional Learning binder, which keeps all PL-related items (i.e.  agendas, attendance sheets; instructional materials distributed, etc.) for Professional Learning conducted throughout the  school year.  Some tentative ENL-related topics that will be scheduled as part of the 2017-18 professional learning calendar include:  “Examining & Understanding EDAT to Identify Your ELLs Strengths & Limitations"   “Academic Language & ELLs: What Teachers Need to Know”   “Exploring Research-based Practices to Increase ELL Student Achievement”  "Best Practices to Support Our ELLs" -Teacher Professional Development Workshops (October - June)                  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68            Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   ELL parents are contacted to schedule individual meetings during the allotted Parent Engagement time on Tuesday afternoons  (2:20-3pm). Alternate meetings are scheduled during regular school hours to accommodate parents when  necessary.  Interpretation is provided by school staff and through use of the NYCDOE Translation Unit by phone  when necessary.In addition, parents receive immediate school information regarding their child through the on-line grading  program, Skedula, which gives parents access through Pupil Path to view their child's grades, attendance, class schedule, and  progress daily.  ENL teachers, classroom teachers, and the Parent Coordinator is available to help parents use this  resource.  On-line communication with parents is also maintained throughout the school year via "Pupil Path". ENL teachers  also plan three parent workshops, under Title III, throughout the school year to provide parents with important information  regarding school policies, including applying for high school, the use of PupilPath and other student-used technology, state  testing and logistics, and strategies for parents to implement at home. These workshops offer a more intimate setting for  parents of ELLs to ask questions and clarify concerns. Translators are present during these workshops as well.   2.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Jeffrey Slivko, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Irwin Altman MS 172                                                                              School DBN: 26Q172  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

Announcements are made over the PA systems in Urdu, Bengali, Punjabi, Hindi and Spanish) during P/T conferences  to remind parents that interpreters are available (as well as the Parent Coordinator being available in the lobby to  coordinate these services). Announcements that interpreters are available are also made - in a variety of languages  available and representative of our school - at the beginning of all major meetings/events. Responses and data from  parent surveys will be used to identify the need for new written language translations and planning for inclusiveness  of language and cultures.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          77
