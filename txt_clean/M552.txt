This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   MISSION STATEMENT:   Section 4: CEP Overview      Gregorio Luperón High School for Science and Mathematics opened in 1994 as the first school in Washington Heights  to serve newly arrived immigrant Latino students. GLHS provides the avenue that enables students to explore the  fields of science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics throughout four years of high school. We prepare our  students to achieve high standards of scholarship and equip them with the necessary skills to be successful in their  college and professional careers.

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.        Our school’s transition to the Common Core Learning Standards has helped ensure that students experience more  rigorous coursework in all content areas, with a strong focus on skill-development and literacy across the content  areas. During this past years, teachers worked to create unit plans for their classes that were rigorous, aligned with  new standards and centered on student learning, and which spelled out clearly the criteria for what students needed  to know and what skills they needed to master in order to move to the next grade in all subject areas - a vertical  alignment approach. This past year, our staff worked to put a long-term curriculum on paper for each of the subjects  that we offer. This school year, our staff has implemented a more data driven instruction approach to increase  student achievement through the collection of student-level and observation data. Teachers reflected during  workshops and departmental time on their progress toward creating highly-rigorous, aligned and student-centered  assessments; however, this rigorous instruction is not reflected in our Regents data, therefore, affecting our  graduation rate. We are in support of closing the achievement gap and setting high expectations for our students to  be successful; and at the same time, we are on the pathway of preparing our students to embrace 21st century skills  and be able to survive in the workplace.       We will be focusing on 5 goals: CCLS aligned and skills based assessments to improve Regents results; Literacy skills  and culturally relevant unit plan development across all content areas to improve NYSESLAT results; Common  assessment strategies with bi-weekly monitoring and accountability to improve student achievement towards an  Advanced Regents diploma; College Focus on Math Regents to increase college readiness benchmarks; and  Advisory To-Go-To person in the building, student-led and parent-led initiatives throughout the 2018-2019 school  year. This school year we will be focusing on motivational initiatives for Latino and Black males in our school.

Strategies to address the needs of students with  disabilities, English language learners, and other high- need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited,  SIFE, STH).      A Professional Learning Team will be created to work on  developing a common understanding about our school data  around student performance and achievement. Algebra and LE  Teams will begin implementing protocols into meetings with  rolling agendas/minutes; work on identifying mastery skills  deconstructed from the unit plans; be provided with a variety of  data, plus an item analysis of June Regents; continuously  analyze student work to modify instruction.    The Professional Learning Team will develop the conceptual  framework about how well we satisfy the academic needs of  every student by analyzing students data in order to determent  the essential learning a student is required to master to be  promoted to the next level. Differentiated instruction will be at  the forefront with a new concept around authentic learning.  Strategies that will address ELLs are: content-related  instructional tasks, multiple entry points, rubrics for self/peer  assessments, literacy guided through graphic organizers,  sentence starters, word activities, and technology tasks through  Google classrooms. Strategies are build around the four  modalities of listening, speaking, reading, and writing.    The Professional Learning Team will conduct at least two  sessions monthly to foster an environment of professional  growth aligned with the CCLS, Charlotte Danielson's Framework,  The Framework for Great Schools and student data around  assessments, feedback and next steps. Our school is part of the  Learning Partners Program and will be collaborating with Emma  Lazarus and Esperanza Preparatory School in cycles of learning.    Lesson and unit plans in all content areas will be refined to focus  on assessment. This will ensure that:     100% of the students participate in Check-For-  Understanding checkpoints.     There is an increase in the course passing grade. In Jan  2018 the course passing rate for mathematics was 58%  and in June 2018 it was 39%.      Each student has a high probability of passing a   midterm, final and Regents with mastery.

This  year each math teacher is using an online platform to  supplement instruction, and students are using TI-84  calculators.              3b – Parent and Family Engagement   How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York  State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible  for implementation and oversight.  Families will be invited for a family-on-one meeting around their child's performance by key personnel like the  Principal, APs, bilingual coordinator, guidance, parent coordinator; community assistant; teacher leaders; and CBO  staff; exposed to the website and Pupilpath; every PA meeting will include a "support-your-child-at-home"  component; ENL classes will be available; and workshops created around parent survey results and needs to better  support their child. In addition, online platforms will be piloted to increase parental support, like Genius Plaza. The  LPP team initiated a student/parent progress monitoring sheet that will allow students and parents to be aware of  grades, set goals, and observe growth. The Principal has initiated a To-Go-To person platform so that every adult can  build a relationship with 5 students and have a better understanding of the entire child and their family.         Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment   Part  4a.  Indicate  resources  you will  leverage  to  achieve  this  annual  goal  and  implement this  action  plan,  including  human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc.  The Professional Learning Team will engage in identifying student data; establishing a network of CBOs; and pilot  online platforms to provide services for and to our school constituents.   The PL Team will be granted with the freedom and the resources to guide the process of revamping instruction  around assessments. The schedule allows for weekly meetings on Mondays. In addition, the CBO Fresh Youth  Initiatives will work very closely with students by grade level to implement the advisory curriculum.    The bell schedule has been modified to increased instructional time with 10 periods daily, some classes will be double  periods and all science classes will have 2 to 3 double period lab classes.   Per session and Per Diem compensation will be provided through various Galaxy funds, Title I, Title III, College Access  for All Funds, Learning Partners Program Funds, and Fresh Youth Initiatives Grants/Funding.

This year the Math Department meets everyday during their circular 6 assignment to co-plan and monitor the  progress of students. Progress reports are accessible to many stakeholders through an online grading system -  Skedula. FYI has tutors from Fordham University helping with our goal to increase math performance and  achievement. Freshmen have a new math teacher using Engage NY Math curricula, and incorporating technology  through the lens of authentic learning using the Revolution K-12 online platform. Sophomores have a new math  sequence of Algebra II one year or two years. Currently, our seniors are at a 79% (113/143) passing rate in Algebra I  and with this new math sequence and all other academic interventions, we aim for 83% by June 2019; 78% (111/143)  passing rate in LE and with the new LE part 3 and 4 course sequence and all other academic interventions, we aimed  for 83% by June 2019. Seniors are also being supported through the college readiness benchmark goal. In 2016-2017  it was 44% and currently 67 out of 143 seniors have achieved college readiness benchmark in mathematics - 47%; we  are aiming for 60% for 2018-2019. The graduation rate went from 59% June 2017, to 69% August 2017, to 76% June  2018, to 81% August 2018. This school year we are aiming for 83% by June 2019. This year each Assistant Principal is  working with a guidance counselor with a Cohort in order to monitor progress, review scholarship data, and conduct  academic interventions to increase student performance and achievement - 6 times a school year. The Principal will  be working with the 10th grade guidance counselor to monitor sophomore progress; and thus far there are 122 of  which all are on track or almost on track with eight students struggling, 14% passed Algebra 1 Regents and 39%  passed the Living Environment Regents - June 2018 data.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  At Gregorio Luperon HS, students are treated with a great sense of respect. We value their respective countries and  cultural backgrounds. Students’ attendance is always high, in 2017-2018 the overall was 92% of which 84% is of  students that have a 90+ attendance / compared to the city where its 69%. Many students and staff members remark  that the school feels more like a family than a school. Teachers and other staff members have strong relationships  with students, with most people in the school knowing everyone else name. In the Superintendent's office visits,  Quality Review, International tours, and Principal partnering visits we are consistently commended on the  environment of the school, the willingness of the students to learn and grow, and the strong relationships that we  have between all members of the school community.   Students feel safe coming to school, so we must take advantage of the high attendance to challenge students to own  their own learning, especially because over 150 out of 520 students are Students in Temporary Housing and our  Economic Needs Index is 92%.   The prioritized needs that we have developed as a staff include providing more opportunities for one-on-one support  for students' in need of social-emotional guidance, especially transitioning to the NYC way of life, academic  achievement, and new family dynamics. Our students have expressed a need to find emotional mentors and supports  in the building. The faculty and staff have expressed the need to empower students in academic press. Becoming  critical thinkers and innovators, learning about 21st Century skills, achieving excellent grades in class, Regents  mastery, earning an Advanced Regents Diploma and the Seal of Biliteracy, taking AP courses and College Now courses,  being part of internships in the community or throughout NYC, applying for CUNY and SUNY schools, and being  College & Career ready are a few of the factors that are in need of increase.

They have been awarded over $500K to work with   our students. This school year they will have Advisory classes through a push-out model with 10 students  throughout the school day. In addition we as a school will follow an advisory curriculum that engage students  in self assessment and challenges them to deepen their commitment to their education. We have 50 staff  members and 500 students; therefore, every staff member will be responsible for 5 to 10 students in the  building. Students are expected to meet with their To-Go-To person on a weekly basis. In addition, all  students will be consistently mentored by a school counselor who will guide them to work career and college  readiness.     We will continue developing a college and career office that seeks out local opportunities for the students and   identifies a target students for educational programs outside the school.      We will continue a college awareness program for grades 9 - 12 through class visits and town hall meetings   (assemblies).     Priority needs relative to Supportive Environment are to increase student achievement through increasing   course and Regents passing rates.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment.

What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.      Teacher collaboration at Gregorio Luperon High School is strong in many departments. Our teachers share resources  and materials, lead PD sessions and serve as mentors to new teachers. Our departments work well together, and  during department meetings, work to uncover trends in student work and then modify their instruction based on the  data. This team created an environment of sharing best practices, sharing lesson plans and resources, flexibility to do  inter-visitations, video-taping and conducting open meetings for self-reflections and criticisms. Our teachers share an  open sharing platform through Google Drive.       This year we will continue this spirit of collaboration by working specifically on lesson planning and literacy strategies  as a whole staff and in departmental teams. It is important that our school develops a strategy for teaching literacy  that is evident in lesson plans, and that is consistently revised based on student work samples that are normed on as  a team. Greater consistency in our approaches to literacy instruction mean that students will also benefit from  greater coherence across classes in different grades and content areas. Despite teachers’ collaboration is at its best,  we are in the process of creating interdisciplinary curricula across grade levels and departments.      Goal #3 Literacy skills across all content areas to improve NYSESLAT results. Originally all of our students are  categorized as English Language Learners, and by junior year we have about 80% of our population remain as ELLs.  Our NYSESLAT data is also tied to our teachers MOSL, and we need to aim for growth in the achievement of the  NYSESLAT. The levels and sub-levels will be used for differentiated instruction.

Teachers will attend PD sessions that provide them with the  FOUR Rs strategies for teaching in the content areas through our  EQUITY focus at Luperon. Each classroom will have a library. In  addition, new audio and speaking initiatives will be brought on  board to supplement learning. In addition, every Tuesday  through Friday students will STOP+DROP_READ for ten minutes a  book/article of their preference, the New York Times and/or  resources from the DELLS office to improve the English  proficiency. The needs of our ELLs fall more on the speaking,  listening and reading modalities. Accountable talk, auditory  strategies, and reading tasks will be implemented throughout the  school year.

While many teachers over the past few years have been working on greater student engagement and ownership  throughout the lessons, there is still a sense in many classrooms that the teacher is “on stage” rather than acting as a  facilitator. Our students are hungry for opportunities for themselves to become reflective and self-evaluative. When  teachers work to create more student centered opportunities, such as Socratic Seminars, students are eager to take  on the challenge.   Administration will focus on norms around feedback that Assistant Principal Supervision provide teachers in  observation discussions and reports, monitor follow-up, and embrace walk-throughs to develop highly effective  instruction. In addition, the administrators need to hold all constituencies more accountable for productivity and  progress. For example, are grades being updated onto Skedula every two weeks; do parents know about their child's  progress through Pupilpath; do families know about their child's transcript and Regents examinations?       Our Regents results need to improve, and one goal around that is to begin the notion of common assessments.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   This school year we are partnering with Fresh Youth Initiatives (CBO) to increase the academic awareness of college  readiness of parents. FYI will be conducting ADVISORY for all 500 students; conducting technology workshops for  students after-school, and conducting field trips for our students and parents throughout New York State to increase  awareness of going-away-to-college opportunities. The school will also be partnering with 100 Schools Project where  our staff/adults will be receiving training and workshops around mental health, restorative justice and crisis  intervention.    The school has a strong web of relationships with several stakeholders in the community. Also, we have a very active  parent association. Every month over 50 parents attend the meetings; the Principal and other faculty members attend  as well; we plan together several activities throughout the school year. We also do advocacy for some family related  issues such as immigration, citizenship, housing, jobs, etc.   We will partner with parents to best support their son/daughter by using an online grade-book that informs their  children attendance and' progress in class on a daily basis to increase parents awareness and students academic  achievement by June 2019.    An area of need is to create a stronger relationship between parents and teachers. We will begin this partnership by  introducing the new teachers to the parents during the first PA meeting in September. Then we will encourage one or  two faculty members to make a presentation on each Parent Association monthly meeting.   This past school year our school welcomed a new member to the team, a community assistant, that is responsible for  serving the needs of our parents and students, networking, and connecting our school to the Washington Heights  community and CBOs.    We are in need of not only connecting to families and the community through the social-emotional arena, but in  academics; therefore, our last goal is around the community's math focus of improving student achievement in the  course of Algebra and the Regents examination. Families need to be aware of math performance is correlated to  remedial courses in college and future finances. We reached a 58% passing rate in the January Algebra Regents for  grades 1- through 12; however, our freshmen reached a 39% passing rate.

Students and  Parents   Every month students will express through meetings their  reflections on ADVISORY, and parents their reflections of  college & career readiness workshops/trips.    Parent Coordinator will create a calendar to distribute to  teachers, parents and SLT members to encourage them to  volunteer their time to stay during the Parents Association  monthly to plan meeting date and topic.      By June 2019, every teacher will attend and present on  his/her class/content, students academic progress and needs  to parents during Parent Association monthly meeting.      Parent volunteers are conducting an arts/crafts business class  for parents during the school day. Involved parents are easier  to work with in regards to their child's academic progress;  and more likely to invest in the school and its well-being and  beneficial for the entire school community.    During PD meetings, teachers and the Bilingual Coordinator  will create presentations for the parents that detail the types  of learning that their students will engage in throughout the  year, especially in Math.

Experienced teachers will continue to share the values and vision of the school demonstrated by their willingness to  improve their preparation and skills; and, by increasing the number of students that excel in their subject areas. Each  new teacher will be paired with a mentor in his/her content area. They will be expected to meet with their mentee  twice a week to co-plan and inter-visit. The AP in each department will plan to set up a schedule with the teacher  pairs in order to establish guidelines for the mentorship. Teachers in their third year who have demonstrated promise  in leadership will be invited to participate in the PD team so that they can begin to expand their effectiveness at the  whole-school level.       As a team, the hiring committee will begin to create a plan for recruitment including a criteria for the types of new  hires we as a school are going to seek out through our hiring efforts in the coming year.       Teachers will be held accountable for their performance through their colleagues. Scholarship data will be reviewed  every marking period by the APs, and in turn, the APs will continue to guide and support teachers. In-house and out- house professional learning opportunities will be provided. Student achievement, NYSESLAT growth data and Regents  results will be considered as a factor of highly qualified staff members. Student performance will be correlated to  highly qualified teachers.

This school year we will have a Peer Collaborative Teacher leading the Professional Learning Team to develop a high- quality collaborative PLC (Professional Learning Community) for teachers to work on the development of high quality  lesson plans that include common core aligned curricula, rigorous objectives, strategies for successful student  engagement, and strong assessment throughout instruction. Throughout the PDs, which will be updated given walk- through observations and teachers' differentiated needs, teachers will spend time engaging with the text "The Global  Achievement Gap" which provides a wealth of resources for how to approach rigor in today's society. Teachers will  spend PD time working under the guidance of a trained member of the PL team in the composition of high-quality,  specific and aligned lesson plans that meet the demands of the Common Core with ELL accommodations. In addition,  half of PLT will be dedicated to initiating item-analysis protocols for teachers to use in identifying trends in the data  they are obtaining in class through assessments and common unit assessments. They will then use these protocols to  establish routine ways for teacher teams to look at data from fresh perspectives.      In addition, members of the PL team will attend monthly meetings through the Teacher Leadership Team to learn  about creating strong PD plans that meet the needs of the teachers. There will be a team of administrators and  teachers sent to attend these sessions to create differentiated learning experiences for the teachers they coach.       The Principal and other school leaders will be attending district PD sessions alongside teachers to gain more content- specific and skills knowledge. We will also be attending college workshops with the guidance department in order to  learn more about the university-level demands on students. Representation from the administration will also attend  all sessions of the TLP alongside a teacher team.      The Principal and APs will create a PD plan of out-house professional learning workshops they would be attending  throughout the school year. It will be highly recommended that they attend PDs related to English Language Learners,  such as, PDs from the DOE office of ELLs, organizations like NYSABE, ADASA, ALAS, ASCD, Latino Caucus, and CSA,         Part 3: TA Schools Only   3a.

N/A        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Teachers will be able to attend the Teacher Leadership Development Program in order to increase their voice in the  pedagogical decision-making within the school. Within the TLP, teacher leaders will focus on Danielson's Domain 3  and 1 in order to promote better planning and assessments in order to increase strong intellectual understanding and  learning.   Teacher teams will agree upon formative and summative assessments. For Regents classes, common assessments will  mimic the NYS Regents examinations after each unit and an item analysis will be a tool to modify instruction. Data will  be analyzed in subject areas to improve or modify curricula.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43           Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Gregorio Luperon High School is just as dedicated to its parents as it is to its students. Parent involvement is an  integral part of our school’s instructional foci and is embedded in our mission and vision. We strive to provide parents  with the tools necessary to support not only their children’s academic development, but also their social-emotional  learning. This effort is manifested via parent workshops in priority need areas such as:   · Learning to read a transcript    · Disciplining children with love and understanding   · Internet safety and cyberbullying    · Brain development and age-appropriate levels of support   Our Parent Involvement Policy will cater to parents’ most pressing concerns, such as how to support their children  academically, effective communication techniques and strengthening family relationships. It will also include a mental  health component dedicated to teaching parents how to detect and rectify concerning behavior in their children and  in themselves.       Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   We are committed to strengthening our parent-school relationship and will continue to work collaboratively for the  benefit of all students.    As a school, we will:   · Provide a safe and productive learning environment for all students   · Implement a culture of mutual respect for students, staff and families   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      · Advocate vigorously on students’ behalf and provide constant levels of support   · Facilitate communication between parents and the school community   · Never give up on our students   As parents, we will:   · Support our children’s education to the best of our ability   · Maintain communication with the school    · Encourage, support and celebrate our children’s achievements   · Monitor attendance, homework and behavior   · Participate in parent assemblies, SLT meetings and school events as often as we can   · Advocate on our children’s behalf   · Never give up on our children   As students, we will:   · Be responsible and committed to our education   · Generate work that fully represents our academic potential   · Arrive to school promptly, every day, ready to learn    · Communicate any concerns to our parents, teachers, administrators or school staff      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association, as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on the  proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input. To increase and  improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support and ongoing professional  development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● Maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;      Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   Gregorio Luperon will further promote parental involvement by:   · Teaching parents how to use our academic platforms such as Pupilpath on an ongoing basis   · Mailing home a monthly newsletter outlining school events, student activities and areas of support    · Encouraging parents to register as volunteers for at least two school events per year   · Working collaboratively with the Parent Association to increase parent participation and involvement   · Inviting parents to attend a monthly “Breakfast with the Principal” or school tour   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      · Creating a suggestion box for parents to express their concerns or contempt   · In addition to an open door policy, scheduling a designated weekly time where parents can call the Parent  Coordinator “hotline” to discuss their child’s progress   · Advertising parent assemblies, SLT meetings and parent teacher conferences via posters, newsletter and  SchoolMessenger    · Updating information on our school website   · Hosting parent support groups       School-Parent Compact (SPC)   School-Parent Compact (SPC)   Gregorio Luperon high school , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds  Act (ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student  achievement between the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and  programs funded by Title I, agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will  share responsibility for improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be  developed to ensure that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.      I. School Responsibilities: High Quality Curriculum   In our efforts to provide a rigorous and challenging curriculum for our students, we plan to use parent input and  support to:   · Establish a peer-tutoring and homework help center for students    · Encourage parent-teacher communication and collaboration   · Promote sound test-taking strategies and effective destressing techniques   · Support students and parents of students struggling academically      I. School Responsibilities: Supporting Home-School Relationships   Students benefit most when their parents and educators advocate and work collaboratively on their behalf.  Therefore, the home-school relationship framework is designed with students’ best interest in mind. We are  partnering with an onsite community based organization to support parents and help them enhance their skillset. For  example, one of our priorities is coordinating school activities that facilitate communication between parents and  their children at home through improvisation. Parents and students will act out different scenarios in an effort to  model and learn best practices for their peers. We also emphasize strengthening the parent-child bond and will be  doing so through engaging activities such as family game night, field day, parent-child softball games and family  retreats.      I. School Responsibilities: Providing Parents Reasonable Access to Staff   Upon registration, each parent or guardian will receive a Parent Handbook, which, among other things, will include a  staff directory complete with email addresses and necessary steps to schedule a meeting or phone conference with  teachers or guidance counselors. Currently, our Principal and Parent Coordinator have an open door policy for parents  and students to address their concerns and can also assist with scheduling meetings. Though our staff are  predominately bilingual, interpretation is always available for those who are not. We host monthly school tours,  which include classroom visits and the opportunity to interact with teachers and students. We strongly encourage   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      parents to reach out to our staff regarding their children’s academic performance before official parent-teacher  conferences and be actively involved in all aspects of their education.       I. School Responsibilities: Providing General Support to Parents   We are well aware of the socio-economic issues that can hinder a parent’s ability to properly support their child. As  part of our “put your oxygen mask on first” approach, we aim to address some of the parents’ most pressing concerns  in the form of personal development. For example, we invite community leaders to facilitate workshops in content  that is relevant to our parents such as: ENL; immigration; housing and renter’s rights; and nutrition.       Because our school population is composed primarily of migrant families, there are certain nuances our families are  more sensitive to and we thereby took into consideration for the creation of the Parent Involvement Policy. For  instance, not all students live with their biological parents and many of them are living under the guardianship of a  subgroup member that may include grandparents, aunts and uncles, and siblings. Therefore, our Parent Involvement  Policy will ensure all members of the parent subgroup are given equal attention and resources that will help them be  an asset to students’ education.       Many of our parents also face a culture shock upon arriving to this country, that, if not addressed could have lasting  effects on students. We aim to alleviate some of the stress and burden newly immigrant parents face by creating a  network of support composed primarily of other parents with professionals stepping in as needed. This is evident in  our social gatherings for parents that include a salsa night, dominoes tournament and parent trip.       Our PIP also focuses heavily on family engagement and the opportunity for parents to interact with their children in a  non-academic setting. To elaborate, we hosted a mother-daughter makeup-up workshop facilitated by one of our  students. We will continue to coordinate family activities that are fun, interactive and engaging for parents and  students.       Lastly, it is important parents know their legal rights to properly advocate for their children. A segment of the parent  assembly meetings will be dedicated to teaching parents the policies set forth by the NYC Department of Education  and Gregorio Luperon High School. Parents are also encouraged to attend parent assemblies, SLT meetings and to join  one of the parent sub-committees which will be implemented in the 2018-19 school year and will include fundraising,  event planning, and student support.          II.

The  NYSESLAT data also shows that 45.56% of students are in need of continuous support as they  are at the transitioning/expanding level for 2 year.  As a result these students who struggle need  supplemental direct instruction in order to meet school, City, State and Federal credit  accumulation, regents, graduation and college and career readiness.  Our students need additional time and smaller classes to be given the supplemental education  they need to be competitive. ELLs, including SIFE students who need additional support  in  making progress on the NYSESLAT, and Special Education students, are one target population  for direct Academic Intervention Services, as supported by these funds. A second target  population is students who are progressing well in achievement on the NYSESLAT, who would  benefit from enrichment. We are targeting direct instruction to our SIFE students, with  anticipated SIFE funds. A third target population of ELLs are students who are progressing well  in achievement on the NYSESLAT, who would benefit from enrichment; note, many of the  SIFE students can take advantage of enrichment programs, too, because they are taught by HLA  and bilingually certified teachers. The intention is for all of our students to be prepared for  college and careers by providing equitable access.  The ENL team comprised of administrators, teachers and the Bilingual coordinator have  identified that many of our students have below grade level Home Language literacy and writing  skills.  The goal for our supplemental program is to enhance academic language in the core  content areas and hone the electronic research and technology skills for college and career  readiness.  The calendar for this program runs from November - June from 4:00pm - 6:00pm on Tuesdays  through Fridays; supported by 4 teachers (3 ENL and 1 license bilingual Spanish teacher) and  Saturdays from 9:00am - 1:00pm.; supported by 2 teachers (1 ENL and 1 licensed bilingual  Spanish teacher ). The program will be held over the course of 26 weeks during the school year,  with a total of approximately 90 after school sessions. Certified bilingual teachers will use the  NYSITELL, NYSESLAT and Spanish LAB data to plan accordingly in order to support the  program's goal.  This data is made available by administrators and the Bilingual Coordinator.  The following programs of direct instruction will be provided to ENL students:  -Small group instruction and enrichment for English and Composition after- school for 25  students who are still in the expanding proficiency level. This will develop students reading and  writing skills. The session will be taught by a licensed ENL teacher in English.  - Small group instruction and enrichment for Spanish Language after-school for 50 students in  9th and 10th grade. This is specially targeted for our SIFE students. The students will develop  their ability to express complex ideas in Spanish language as well as learn important reading and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   writing skills and techniques which will carry over to the English Language.

This will develop thirty (30) 11th graders who are still in the bottom  third and provide support to twenty (20) 12th graders strengthen their English proficiency. This  will be taught by dually licensed ELA/ENL teachers.   - ELA/Art class to help students increase their achievement in all subjects. Class will meet  during Saturday academy, where students will learn about their native cultural identity and  develop their literary analysis and writing skills.  Sessions will be taught by dually license ELA  and ENL teachers.   The program will use CCLS informational/content area text to supplement classroom  instruction.  In addition, students will have access to online texts through the use of macbooks,  computers and smartboards. Online Programs such as Castle Learning, Plato and Newsela are  available during this program.  Students will also master the use of online resources such as  google docs.  Students will have the opportunity to learn social studies content through films,  followed by discussions and writing pieces; science research through the science content; Math  and technology through Robotics; ENL through phonetics and interactive grammar vocabulary  games; and Online ENL grammar/vocabulary games.  Extra funding will be available through other school funds.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?    GLHS uses diagnostic exams in English, Mathematics and Spanish. In conjunction with NYSITELL scores, we use the results of  these exams to help with the programming of students. In the English/ENL department, teachers immediately examine the  result of these exams to discern the appropriate academic needs of the students entering their courses. In departments, we  divide these into students’ grammar needs, their reading comprehension needs, writing fluency needs and speaking fluency  needs. We then ensure that these skills are targeted in individual unit plans that span the sequence of ENL/ELA courses that  our students experience. We have developed a blueprint for the way these skills must be integrated and scaffold for students  over the ENL/ELA course sequence that takes these skills, pairs them with Common Core State Standards, and establishes   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      specifically measurable objectives for the assessment of each. The assessments continue periodically throughout the school  year to determine progress in reading comprehension. Teachers use this quantitative data in order to better group the  students in guided reading groups, for lesson differentiation, and to guide instruction for their students. The Foundations  program is also used to promote phonemic awareness skills.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   GLHS has a collaborative team of educators that meet weekly through their circular 6 co-planning periods to use data from  assessments to drive instruction.  Besides content knowledge, it is the skills that are being assessed for vertical and horizontal  alignment.  We have a PD Team that also modifies their agenda around the school's instructional foci in order to review the  outcomes of assessments.  There are several department teams, committee and a new Bilingual team that meets regularly to  decipher assessments and curricula for instructional planning.  We have a Google-drive with teacher created unit plans that  are also modified; and we use this as a form of communication among pedagogues.        3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?   A Bilingual/ENL teacher team oversees the analysis and data effectiveness as well as the program with an emphasis on the  expected outcomes, analysis of formative and summative assessments (ELA, Math, Science, and Social Studies, NYSESLAT,  Spanish LAB, Pre and post assessments) to drive instruction and evaluate the program. The team determines, identifies and  prioritizes the evaluation tools to measure expected outcomes. The team is also responsible for monitoring and disseminating  all second language learner data throughout the staff. In addition, the team makes professional development  recommendations to provide teachers and other staff member with the needed tolls to address second language acquisition.  Teachers maintain data folios, work folders, follow IEP objectives, take attendance, observe student work and participation,  assist students with self-assessment techniques (i.e. questionnaires and surveys), and conference with students and parents to  assess goals and expectations. Second language learners and their parents have been considered highly priority for the  implementation of the New Common Core State Standards. Professional development for teachers takes place, in school,  every Monday after school from 2:30PM to 3:10PM all staff are invited . The teachers, staff, and program administrator(s)  discuss best practices for instruction, student placement/attendance, student progress and assessments, intervention  strategies, parental participation, resources and materials, time and space format, guidance support, and collaboration  without and in school professional development providers. The bilingual team also meets bi-monthly on Fridays from 9-11 to  identify areas of need and to plan PD and roll-out for the whole staff.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    One of the summative assessments that our teachers have put into place are practice/Regents mock assessments.  Once the  summative data has been gathered, it gets placed into a folder in our Google drive, and further analyzed as a group.  The  group then runs an item analysis of each question to identify needs to re-teach content, build on skills and/or concentrate on a  particular standard.  As for daily classroom summative assessments, one practice being used is the department team will  select samples of student work, analyze the data, and give each other constructive criticism to improve outcomes for specific  students.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A        6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].      Our students consistently progress about a year in terms of performance level each grade. By the time our students are  seniors, the majority have achieved a Commanding level on their NYSESLAT. Some seniors might gain ELL status by achieving  Expanding on the NYSESLAT and a 65 on the Regents Examination in English (Common Core) as defined by section 100.18 of  the regulations of the Commissioner of Education. At the start, though, our students are most reticent at the writing and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      speaking portions of the exam. Our students are conscientious and want to do well, but are plagued with blocked senses of  fluency when it comes to the production of language at the early stages of their language acquisition. This makes sense  because in the earlier levels, we emphasize the skills of reading and listening intensely, relying on the intermediate levels to  begin integrating more rigorous fluency work for our students. This is when we see the largest jump in NYSESLAT scores - the  transition between the 10th and 11th grades, when students can finally put all four pieces of the English Language acquisition  puzzle together.-    Gregorio Luperón High School for Science and Mathematics aims to provide a comprehensive education  that prioritizes inquiry among our student body of English Language Learners (ELLs) (100% during  freshmen year and currently 17% former-ELLs). This learning occurs in a Transitional Bilingual Education  setting, which acknowledges and celebrates students’ language, culture and prior experiences, while  simultaneously teaching them English in preparation for post-secondary education.  21st century skills  are embedded into teachers’ practices to support students as they prepare for a technologically advanced  world that values innovation and collaboration. Our faculty understands the challenges our students  confront. Therefore, student learning experiences prioritize critical thinking through real-world  applications, whether in a science classroom throughout a project-based learning (PBL) approach, on a  trip to experience the function of government in Washington D.C. or through the collaborative creation of  a robot in a robotics class.  Our fundamental core beliefs in terms of community are acceptance, trust  and mutual respect.    From the time they are in the 9th grade, our students are pushed to high levels of rigor in their content-  areas classes, which are taught primarily in Spanish. Teachers in these classes employ strong ELL  supports to push students toward domain-specific and academic language acquisition. In order to ensure  that our students are producing work that meets Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS) standards  in all classes, they are provided with accommodations such as extended time on assessments,  glossaries/dictionaries, translated assignments, and are grouped based on language needs.     As students enter the 11th and 12th grade, classes are taught primarily in English, with the continued  presence of ELL accommodations and supports. With the SIFE (students with interrupted formal  education) students, teachers use explicit instruction, technology (iPads and the computer lab),  collaboration and group work and Saturday peer mentoring. Toward the goal of developing language  skills, building student confidence and encouraging 21st century skills like problem-solving and  communication across networks, we believe our students learn best when allowed to create their own  strong questions and discuss with each other using both Spanish and English. To support these  initiatives, our students have been taught to use Webb’s Depth of Knowledge chart to create complex  levels of inquiry across the content areas. They are provided with sentence starters and accountable talk tactics to support the  complex discussion of course content that follows. An overview of our academic program is as follows:     * In the 9th grade, our students receive the required Algebra, Science, History, English as a new language, ELA, Native  Language Arts, PE, Introduction to robotics and computer science.  9th grade assembly/town halls meetings take place once a  month to address issues such as understanding transcripts, bullying, safety and discipline and college readiness. During the  month of April, the entire 9th grade has a half a day assembly with two guidance counselors and the safety liaison.  On this  day, several workshops take place related to academics and social-emotional issues.     * In the 10th grade our students take Global Studies, Health, Robotics, ELA, PE, Math, Earth Science or Chemistry and Music  Appreciation.  At this grade level we begin exposing our students to a higher language tier in their ENL classes. The ENL  curriculum, while aligned to the Common Core Standards, also prepares our students for the following year’s Common Core  ELA Regents exam.  In their Native Language class, our students begin preparing for their first Advanced Placement class, AP  Spanish Language. At this grade level our students take the PSAT. Students begin to be exposed to colleges through college  visits or College Fair.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      * In the 11th our students take United States History and Government, Physics or Earth Science, ELA, ENL, PE, Trig/Alg 2,  Robotics, AP Spanish Language, Introduction to Technology, Music.  During this grade students take SAT Preparation courses in  the school or on Saturdays with one of our CBOs. College Now classes at CUNY.  Their internships endeavors begin here.     * In the 12th grade, students take, AP Calculus, AP Environmental Science, AP Physics, AP Literature, ELA, ENL, PE, Participation  in Government and Economics and College Writing. A small population of our students take AP Language and College Now  classes at CUNY - City College. In terms of assessment, our students engage in self- and peer-assessment on a daily basis and  teachers are consistently taking the pulse of their classes. They strategically use technology to complement these efforts; for  instance, teachers use Google Drive throughout all content-areas and grade levels to provide feedback to students. We use  software such as Pupilpath, Vocabulary.com, Castle Learning and Agile Mind to prioritize areas of continued need for our  students.    The results of these daily assessments are then used to inform teaching practice the next day.  This data also becomes the  strategic base for department and whole-school PD meetings, in which teachers reflect on data to create departmental goals  and share best practices for moving student achievement within these areas of need. This year, we have engaged in both  tuning and consultancy protocols to guide these conversations and establish school-wide and department-specific next steps.      The impact of this work has been that: * 100% of our seniors are taking more than one core English class to ensure deep  engagement with reading and writing at the college level. * In the science department, 25 of our seniors are enrolled in an AP  level class that makes extensive critical thinking demands.  * We have begun a new Advanced Science Research class: 10  students  * Students enrolled in our robotics classroom develop exceptionally strong language skills from the project-based  model they encounter, which forces them to have a reason to use language learned in class, and to practice their fluency  routinely in their interactions with other schools and at competitions. * Increased participation in SAT class preparation  *  Increased results in ELA Common Core Passing: 85%  * Increased results in Algebra Common Core Passing: 79%     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Schoolwide goals illustrate our vision toward leveraging our strong community toward creating a more  collaborative, trusting environment for our teachers and more rigorous educational experiences for our  students. Toward that end, we have prioritized the following goals school-wide for completion and  reflection by the end of the 2018-2019 school year:    * Rigorous Instruction → Lesson and unit plans in all content areas will be refined to  instructional objectives and essential questions promote deep levels of critical thinking  across grade and subject area. All lesson plans will include aligned objective and  assessment, vocabulary supports, intentional planning to support lowest third students, ELL  students or students with an IEP. Based on classroom observation data, AP Supervision  feedback and student performance data, the PD Team will create a list of topics to be  addressed during PD meetings. PD Plans will be updated regularly based on further data  collected from observations and student work formally and informally.      * Supportive Environment - Guidance counselors will facilitate at least five workshops by  grade-level to promote the socio-emotional growth of students’ academic performance, post-  secondary plans, socio-emotional well-being, safe choices and mental health.    * Collaborative Teachers - Teachers work together to revise horizontal alignment among  departments for coherence, while simultaneously updating the vertical alignment together in  teams. By the end of the school year, teachers will develop and implement an approach to  teaching literacy that ensure coherence across classes.    * Effective School Leadership - Administrative learning walks are conducted on a twice to three  times a month to ensure that staff increases its understanding of Danielson’s Framework for   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      Teaching. Teacher feedback and follow-up will be conducted on non-evaluative basis to  ensure that teachers are implementing recommendations in their classrooms.    * Strong Family-Community Ties - In order to increase communication between the faculty and  the parents, faculty members will actively participate in the Parent Association meetings over  the course of the year. Teachers will talk with parents about their class/content area, provide  updates on student progress and develop deeper relationships with students’ families.    PD Team meetings focus on developing a shared and continuously growing understanding of what strong  teaching looks like across the content areas.  In the first PD session of the year, we focused on questioning and analyzed the  ways in which a single lesson was pushing students gradually from more basic questions to higher-order. Teachers brought a  sample lesson and the department worked on analyzing one to create a grid of the ways that the questions gradually pushed  students to do more work throughout the course of the lesson. In this way, departments worked on seeing a fully scaffolded  set of questions within the context of a single objective.     As a result of some of the questions that arose from this first session, the PD team built out the first three PD sessions to  revolve around questioning. The first involved learning about how the Danielson Rubric defines effective and highly effective  questioning and becoming clear as a staff about the criteria for each. Subsequent PD sessions will focus on different branches  of Danielson’s Domain 3. In the first few meetings of the year, we focused on strategies for Student-led discussion. We began  with a half-day PD on this during the September conference days, but teachers expressed a desire to work on questioning  more thoroughly. We returned to models of student-centered discussion in an upcoming PD, so that all teachers can share  their progress toward creating Level 4 questions for and with students.  In subsequent PDs during the first semester, we  focused on strategies for discussion and engagement that teachers could implement in their classrooms immediately and then  share with the rest of the staff. During the second semester, the PD team has focused on data analysis and the ways that the  staff can use various data points to help inform instructional choices. We began by engaging in student work consultancy  protocols aimed at providing a closer look at student mastery within individual lessons. We then moved into a tuning protocol  which we were able to use to investigate Regents data in departments to establish departmental priorities moving forward in  the semester.    In department meetings, teachers work to create skill blueprints that analyze the kinds of growth and learning a student  should be mastering as he/she progresses through the levels. In this way, we have worked to ensure vertical coherence within  content areas through the use of these blueprints. For instance, the English department used the first Chancellor’s PD day in  November to create an ELA Blueprint. We aim to return to this during the June Chancellor’s PD day to revisit our work around  questioning and discussion so that we can use our data analysis from this year as a basis for figuring out how to modify our  curricula and vertical/horizontal alignment to close these gaps. For instance, argumentative essay writing is a common feature  in most classrooms, so we will explicitly write out the types of prompts that students may see that require this type of writing  and the expectations for each in each of the content areas.     We use promotional assessments that are aligned across content areas.       * In each of the content areas, teacher share common assessment that they spend department time creating, updating, and  analyzing to identify trends in student progress.    * Department meetings in November and December will prioritize assessment and data analysis to begin the process of  cultivating data to analyze our students’ growth in writing and reading. We will break into smaller groups by level to determine  what we can identify within the data that will help us create priorities for the second marking period.    The Professional Development team, this year has been accepted to the Teacher Leadership Program with a team of 5  teachers from across the content areas working on a monthly basis (occasionally with an administrator present) to create a PD  plan and build up an arsenal of best practices for adult learning, including protocols for investigating adult and student work.  The PD team then works to turn key these activities to meet the needs they have been communicated by the administration as   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61         a result of observation data.    Individual teachers also meet with administrators at the end of each Marking Period to discuss student data across his/her  classes and to create a prioritized list of focus areas for the upcoming Marking period – these priorities span across the focuses  of PD and Department meetings but reflect a focus on individual and schoolwide goals.    Data from observations is regularly used to establish goals for professional development. Cabinet meetings are held each  month wherein the administration meetings to figure out trends in teacher data that is then communicated to the PD team,  who plans a series of meetings to develop a shared understanding of the metric, build out rationale for its importance, provide  a menu of best practices and support teacher in integrating these best practices into their classrooms and then sharing the  results in future meetings through video protocols. In addition, the administration prepares workshops for teachers to learn  more about various methods and strategies for pushing students to higher levels of inquiry and allow their classrooms to  become labs for other teachers to observe, provide feedback and ask questions of. After each observation, administrators  meet with teachers with immediacy to discuss the feedback and set a timeline for follow-up and further supports as needed.  Administrative conferences with teachers are always aligned directly to the Danielson framework, with explicit discussion of  how to each teacher may move students purposefully toward deeper levels of intellectual engagement throughout the course  of a given unit. Administrators have also begun to conduct collaborative observations with teachers (walkthroughs) in order to  be extremely rubric-focused and help educate teachers about how the language of the rubric can be used to coach teachers.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Students in their senior year are served in a freestanding ENL program. They are grouped heterogeneously take  classes in English, with the exception of their mandated ENL hours. Students who score commanding on their  NYSESLAT or who achieve Former-ELL status because of a combination of their Regents scores and NYSESLAT scores  are also placed in our freestanding ENL program. They are served by licensed ENL teachers through a push-in model in  English courses.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     In the freshman through junior years, with the exception of those students who score commanding, all of our  students are placed in a heterogeneously programmed TBE program where they are served by ENL licensed teachers  in both their ELA classes and bilingual certified teachers their content-area classes. ENL classes are grouped more  homogeneously based on students’ NYSESLAT scores and grade levels.     c.  DL program.  If applicable.      In the Dual Language program there are 15 students that scored a commanding in the NYSESLAT and 15 with  expanding.  Instruction is taught weekly in a specific language (Spanish one week and English the following week).        2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Part 154 is used to guide programming. An added class in the commanding levels supports the continued and needed  development in writing and reading.  We over serve in the sense that we offer 3 ENL classes for freshmen through juniors  regardless of their levels (675 minutes a week).  Only seniors have one to two ENL classes.  Next school year (2018-2019) we   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62      will be programming our students differently.     In the TBE program, the school follows the recommended percentage of NLA/ENL English Proficiency Level in the core  subjects, where the students begin with entering/emerging 60/40, expanding  50/50, transitioning 30/70 and commanding  0/100. The students are placed in ENL classes until the commanding level is achieved; afterwards, students continue receiving  language instruction support with a curriculum that emphasizes writing and reading.    In the ENL EN/EM’ classes, the focus is on vocabulary, academic language to support across the area content, reading  strategies and writing to reinforce comprehension. All newcomers entering the school, are required to be part of a bridge  summer program. The focus in the expanding levels is reading, writing and literary technique and elements and how they help  the reader and the writer to convey an idea.  In the transitioning ENL classes, students learn to use the proper academic  language of literature.  Language development and acquisition is embedded in all levels. The results of the NYSESLAT guided us  to make the decision to add a  stronger reading component within the EN/EM levels of ENL and additionally, this year after  looking at the results of the NYSESLAT and alignment to the CCSS, more writing is embedded across content areas.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Teachers were developed during last academic year on how to begin aligning their instruction, whether it was at any NYSESLAT  level to the CCLS. Two Common Core aligned units were created by each teacher. The support continues and teachers are  expected to make the adequate language accommodations in their lesson plans and their instruction.  These accommodations  have to reflect the language allocation indicated in TBE program and the students language levels.  In the ENL classes, all ELLS  are prepared for the ELA Regents in as early as in the emerging level and the preparation continues in the pre-ELA Regents  classes, where an added class focuses on English literature and literary elements is offered.  Support is slowly emerging from  the NLA department for both History and ELA.  Extended day and Saturday classes are offered in order to expand the  student's’ preparation for the Regents. Item analysis is done every year after the administration of the ELA and the History  Regents exams in order to identify those skills where students need help with, but also to modify instruction, assessment and  curriculum.  In math, science and history, teachers are expected to design their units, lesson plans and instruction, with the  NYSESLAT data in order to foster language development. Even though it has been a challenge for teachers to align their  instruction to the CCLS which is designed with a monolingual population in mind,  teachers have decided to scaffold the  standards in the ninth grade to ensure students build up the skills expected to master on each grade and so forth. Teachers  identify students at risk and their low level skills, which are not limited to language, and as teachers meet individually with  their instructional supervisor and teams, instructional strategies are developed to foster language and skills mastering.  This  school year, we have a new instructional leader that is focusing on science and has developed a new science team that is  currently working on developing pedagogical skills, structures, and systems to better serve our ELLs in reference to instruction,  language development around the NGSS.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   Students who score entering, emerging and transitioning are given their state assessment in their native language. Students  who score expanding and commanding are given the choice. Copies of the teachers' assessments are requested and provided  by and to the department chair. Copies of these exams are kept in the Assistant Principals offices.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Before implementing differentiated instruction, we make sure each student has gone through a diagnostic process.  It includes  the use of assessments to determine student readiness. The assessment also informs us of the student's individual interest  and learning style.  Some of the strategies that we use to differentiate instruction for:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63        a. SIFE: visuals, lower grade texts in Spanish, simplified vocabulary definitions; use of graphic organizers, scaffolding students'  activities and independent reading,  small class instruction,  an extended day which includes having two days a week after  school for two hours each, one on Saturday for four hours and a book club that meets once a week for two hours.  SIFE  students who are in the 9th grade are placed in a special program.  This program has a Science, NLA and ENL  component.  These classes are extended to two hours of Spanish and two of Science on Saturday and twice after school during  the week.  The SIFE classes continue to the Spanish Level five and end with the Advanced Placement Spanish Language  examination.    b. NEWCOMER: depending on the NYSESLAT levels, we create homogenous or heterogenous groups depending on skill  performance.  Our teachers use books like SIDE_BY_SIDE.  Teachers research and implement strategies that are specific for the  ELL population.  We use sentence starters, demo-work, accountable talk, visuals, realia, organizers, and jigsaw strategies.     c. DEVELOPING: we continue some of the differentiated instruction mentioned above in addition to less dependent skills and  move towards the independence factor.  We continue to perform on going formative assessments, grouping, group products,  critical thinking ideas, and student choice.     d. LONG TERM: we like to analyze the progression of modalities from year to year for NYSESLAT levels.  For LTELLs To meet the  needs of the Long Term ELLs, the school has added additional ENL, NLA and content classes after school and on Saturday to  ensure proficiency in the language are met and in the state standardized assessments.  At the beginning of the school year,  these students are identified and a plan is laid out to support Long Term ELLs’ language and academic growth and ensure that  these students graduate.    Long term ELLs,  are expected to take part of the extended day twice to four times a week, and or on Saturday. The Social  Worker meets periodically with the students and his/her family to ensure their socio-emotional well being. Both guidance  counselors are responsible for two cohorts and its long term ELLs  identified in these cohorts.         6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   All of our ELL-SWDs receive general education services with daily SETSS support as recommended by their individual IEP. In the  general education classroom, teachers incorporate various ELL scaffolding techniques (activating learner’s background, using  visuals/multimedia/graphic organizers/sentence starters, collaborative peer learning, etc.) into their instruction to ensure that  all students readily access grade-level academic content and build English proficiency. For ELL-SWDs, teachers also utilize  differentiation strategies so as to cater to each student’s individual needs and learning methods. To further facilitate the  successful learning process of ELL-SWDs, teachers provide preferential classroom seating, repetition and reinforcement of  instruction, and frequent teacher check-ins and feedback throughout the lesson. During SETSS, the Special Education teacher  provides individual/small-group curricular reinforcement with L1 support. In addition, the Special Education teacher confers  and collaborates with ENL teachers to effectively meet the language development needs of each individual ELL-SWD.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?    When accessing the least restrictive environment, our ELL-SWDs have the same opportunities as their general education peers  as they are programmed in general education classes with a small-group SETSS in a separate classroom everyday. In the  general education classroom, ELL-SWDs are heterogeneously grouped with peers who share their same L1 and engage in  various collaborative learning activities to afford greater opportunities in meeting their language development goals. The  general education teachers also actively participate in each student’s IEP building process to devise measurable and realistic  IEP goals and to incorporate differentiated instruction that effectively meets such goals. Furthermore, teachers become   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64      familiar with each ELL-SWD’s testing accommodations so that students can demonstrate mastery of skills and attainment of  knowledge without being limited by their disability.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  AIS Services first, then Title III program and the subgroups addressed.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      There will be three new programs next school year. One will be through a community-based organization called Fresh Youth  Initiatives (FYI) for socio-emotional support.  Another an Advisory program, where every staff member will have 10 students to  advise throughout the school year and they will be the TO-GO to person in the school for each student.  The best for last, we  are beginning a dual-language program to begin in grade 9 and to be added to one year every year after.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A       11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  In addition to Title III supplemental program; Regents tutoring program; Science make-up Lab program; and extra-curricula  activities, we also have the following clubs: Phonics, Robotics, Science, History through Film, Sports, Hiking, and Geek  Squad.  We have targeted credit recovery and mandated tutoring services.  FYI is conducting many workshops around  adolescents & society like Cyberbullying, STDs, dances, and many others.  Our guidance counselors are running a variety of  workshops and programs around College Access for All, Girls Rock, and Sports.  We also have a dance teacher conducting  Mambo classes.  Our new parent coordinator is standing up for more student voice and events like the first time ever Talent  show, end-of-the-year dance, next-year's homecoming dance, and others.  Our COSA director is leading our student  government, senior club and yearbook. We have a new Community Assistant conducting workshops for our students in the  library, and building connections through CBOs for our students.  Our students are going beyond school premises for other  programs like the AMNH, Public Library, NYPD Explorers Program, and many others.  You will read throughout the LAP a array  of school programs and services for our ELLs.             12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  * Under the new leadership, there have been many new school initiatives, especially in the science  arena and community outreach.  Our new Principal is working with the Science Team to develop  our future S.T.E.A.M. program.  Our Principal has connected us to her former school, Manhattan  Center for Science and Mathematics High School, where she was the Science AP, and we are  now in partnership with the Advanced Science Research program and the Robotics Team.  This  school year, ten of our students will be attending a camping trip with Lamont Doherty Earth  Observatory with MCSM HS and students from the Netherlands.  Our Principal is also co-  teaching with some of our new science teachers, and is currently teaching as an Adjunct  Professor at our school through Albany State University.  This program is called University in the  High School and titled Advanced Science Research (ASR), in which our sophomores begin a  sequence of research classes up to 6 high school credits, find mentors around NYC’s hospitals  and research labs, register for UHS courses at Albany, and can earn up to 12 college credits  before they exit our school.     This school year we are part of the city’s initiative College Access for All, received a grant for $30K and were recently accepted  in the College Bridge program that follows.     Due to next year’s plan of increasing the science department staff to better serve our innovators of tomorrow, we will also be  implementing a new Summer Bridge program for all incoming freshmen.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65        * We now have a Bilingual Coordinator to better serve our ELLs and working on next school year’s Dual Language program. We  opened an office for our bilingual program located in our school's library. This position is key for improving communications  with parents of ELLs. It is a venue for parents to feel welcome, automatically accepted and to learn about our instructional  programs, Furthermore, this office has an open door policy, where parents, students and teachers are welcome to visit at any  given time. It keeps everyone involved in our students’ education and is the main conduit through which parents, know about,  understand and engage in their child’s academic achievement and language acquisition. In addition to serving the parents, this  office also connects staff to students across content areas. Our Bilingual Coordinator has conducted the following PD's for our  staff in order to better serve our ELLs:  * 1- Becoming familiar with the English Language Learner Policy and Reference Guide. During this PD, teachers learn about ELL  identification process, which includes, guidelines for student admission, parent orientation and student NYSITELL/LAB-R  testing.  * 2. Analyzing NYSITELL & NYSESLAT data on the ELL data assessment tool - Teachers were provided with the current data to  review in order to understand student's individual results and grouped them accordingly. Teachers were also provided with  strategies to incorporate in the supplemental program based on students’ individual proficiency levels.  * 3. Incorporating scaffolding and differentiation strategies in the lesson for the supplemental program- Teachers will be  provided with targeted proficiency level strategies to improve writing and reading strands.  * 4. Using Classroom data- Teachers will have available other standardized assessment data, as well as data from the teachers  to guide their supplemental program instruction.     * Our new Parent Coordinator has been serving our students-in-temporary-housing, part of the new Discipline team,  conducting Girl Talk shows and the first Talent show, and teaching our parents technology and ENL classes.      * We also have a new Community Assistant that has been connecting the school to Washington Heights organizations and  elected officials.   * Our school is special because our current Councilman, Ydanis Rodriguez, was a teacher at GLSM HS, and  continues to give back to our school and has allowed many of our students to participate in internship programs through his  office.      * Our school also has a new Safety Liaison to increase the accountability around discipline with a small group of students which  has decreased the rates of the cutting-class reports, increased attendance, and decreased school incidents.      * We recently found out that our CBO, Fresh Youth Initiatives, has been granted over $500K to continue their program in our  school.      * Other New Initiatives and Highlights:    * One of the top transitional bilingual programs in our community  * College Now, College Access for All, College Bridge  * International Exchange Program with the Netherlands   * Fresh Youth Initiatives  * Robotics * Computer Science - STEM Program  * First Annual AALSTEM Tech Fair   * Partnership with Federal Reserve Bank  * Museum of Natural History  * Future Dual Language Program  * Innovative Club Offerings  * Webpage (work in progress)  * Khan Academy * Genius Plaza * SAT Revolution K-12  * AP Classes  * College and Career Office, Posse Scholarship  * Dance Classes  * PENCIL Fellows   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66      * ACDP - GED program  * Art Program w/ Reynaldo Pantaleon  * Outstanding Survey Results  * Summer Bridge program  * Music / Orchestra Class  * Sports Opportunities * Volleyball * Basketball * Baseball * New Girls’ Softball     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Diversity of textbooks in students' Native Language    For the new DL program: 15 EP and 15 SP students will take classes together except ELA and NLA.  The 15 EP will take ELA and  LA, and the 15 SP will take ENL and NLA.  Language instruction will take place in a week-by-week model where one week  instruction/assessments in English and the next week in Spanish.  Classroom decor will be differentiated by blue and red.  All  resources will be provided in both languages.  The goal is to master both languages.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    CR Part 154  We serve approximately 60% newcomers, and sometimes it is necessary to have an age difference in a classroom setting;  however, next school year, we will begin one section of classes for the older students.  For the most part, our classes are  designed around the four grade levels and appropriate age groups with the NYSESLAT data driving our programming.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    1. We believe that the establishment of a nurturing community is essential to our students’ transition from  their native countries and their continued educational growth over the course of their four years.    * Over the past two years, we have established a team of teachers and counselors to create an  advisory curriculum that spoke to the socio-emotional and academic needs of our students. This  year, we shifted this away from an every-other-day model to a once a month Town Hall model.  Every other Monday, guidance counselors meet with students from a grade band to engage in  an activity centered on a pillar we’ve identified in students’ maturation process. This includes for  9th and 10th graders, sessions on students’ socioemotional growth and development such as:  * Students’ sexual health and healthy relationships  * Consent and sexual abuse prevention  * Depression and suicidal thoughts in teenagers  * Healthy friendships and peer pressure  * Bullying and cyberbullying  * Communication with parents and family    * In the 11th and 12th grade, our Town Hall meetings include academic and professional skill  development, in preparation for the transition to college and other post-secondary options. Our  students have the chance to work one-on-one with our College Advisor and to work with alumni  who come to support upperclassmen in preparing for this transition. They attend workshops  throughout the year on:  * Interviewing skills and resume writing  * Building a college list and self-evaluating a transcript  * SAT and ACT preparation  * Financial Aid overviews  * Career days and College fairs  * Enrollment workshops and support through college transition  * Essay writing and application completion workshops  * Reading a transcript and understanding graduation requirements   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67        * New this year has been our partnership with the COMPASS program through the Fresh Youth  Initiatives organization. Through this partnership, we will bring in two school social workers who  will be at the school three times a week during lunch periods to help support our 9th and 10th  grade students through their transition to the US high school system and whatever other  emotionally needs they may be facing. In addition, the organization will bring other services to  the school including art classes, music and dance classes on Saturdays, college trips and career  fairs open to all students.    2.  However, we balance this with high expectations for student growth and performance.  * We have established rigorous qualifications for promotion that we have enforced to ensure that students are accumulating  the necessary credits needed to graduate career and college ready within four years.  * We provide extensive and intensive after-school tutoring across all content areas to support the lowest third of students in  gaining the skills they need to master class content.  * We offer extensive options to support academically advanced students including AP courses, college preparation courses,  College Now classes available outside of the school at four-year city university programs, and other extracurricular activities.  * All students are eligible to take free SAT preparation courses through the school more than once per year so they are  prepared for the demands of the test (which does not allow for ELL accommodations).  We have partnered with other  organization to better serve our ELLs through SAT prep like DELLS SAT Saturday program, Revolution K-12, and Genius Plaza  (A.K.A. PreK 12 Plaza).      3. Our guidance department works to ensure strong collaboration between multiple stakeholders that impact student growth  and development.  * Since the last Quality Review, we worked hard to increase the visibility of our college culture and parent partnerships and  hired a dedicated college counselor and another school counselor to support our expanded goals.  * Counselors work to maintain a strong relationship with partner organization such as ESI by attending PDs on school culture,  college access and culturally responsive teaching across the content areas.  * Last year, a team of teachers, admin and counselors created a team to manage the goals and programs associated with an  ESI Family and School Partnerships mini-grant. The aim was to creatively bring more parents into the work that was going on in  their students’ classes and help them take a greater part in their students’ learning. The work of this grant allowed for  parent/student movie nights to discuss Social Studies coursework, a school-wide trip to DC to deepen student and parent  engagement and awareness with US Government concepts, and routine Saturday meetings for parents to engage in  discussions about how to read transcripts, track student progress toward graduation and prepare for transition to college.  * Counselors work closely with PA leadership to support their efforts and promote various school events that will allow parents  to deepen their relationship with the school and their capacity for supporting their students through their high school  experiences. Teachers also attend PA meetings regularly in order to share more about their departments’ work with students  and answer parent questions about student progress and learning in individual classes. Family Night provides an opportunity  for parents to meet with teachers and learn the expectations for individual classes.  * Counselors work in challenging students to take on afterschool and summer enrichment opportunities, and support student  development of study skills, anxiety management, growth mindset.  * Parents routine communicate with parents through phone calls home, newsletters and electronic communication via  Skedula. Parent outreach time is prioritized every other Monday so that teachers have dedicated time within which to speak  with parents about student progress in class and support them in learning more about the content and how to support their  child’s academic goals. During Family Night and Parent Teacher conferences, parents are provided workshops on how to access  their student’s academic information and progress and communicate with their child’s teachers.  * Through our work with school culture, we have seen the following impact:  * Attendance rate of 92% for the past school year  * Attendance rate at Parent Association meetings is steady at 60-80 parents  * Students participate in and are challenged through programs like NYPL after school programs, PENCIL Fellows Internship  Program, American Museum of Natural History Saltz Summer Internship, City College’s College Now Program, City College’s   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68         STEM Summer Program, Centro Altagracia for volunteer work, the School Construction Authority’s Summer Internship,  YM&YWHA for after school work and SAT prep, Let’s Get Ready SAT and College Preparation.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   The students who enroll at Gregorio Luperon before the beginning of the school year,  are programmed to enroll in a summer  program that has three components, Math, English and Gym. In addition to this program,  if the students come from middle  school (still newcomers), they spent an afternoon at the school. On that afternoon, they take a tour and receive an orientation  package that includes a meeting with their parents. Students who enroll throughout the school year, are given a tour, and on  one orientation with the parents/tutor in attendance.    How do we help them adapt to an HS situation? Student ambassadors       17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    AP Spanish Language and AP Spanish Literature, French 1-4     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Another DL class begins in the 2018-2019 school year:  a. One week English: one week Spanish  b. Core content taught in both languages separated by week-by-week model  c. Separated by week to master both  d. We will begin with Spanish week 1     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  PD Team - TLPIn-house PD done by Bilingual CoordinatorMFSCDELLS  Math for America  Other out-house PDs, especially for CTLEThroughout last year and the year before, all teachers were provided in-house  professional development by the school Network coach, on lesson aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards, PBL and  Literacy Units. This year these conversations continue every week and are included in the year calendar of Professional  Developments.   The team will be working together on understanding the NEW citywide instructional expectations, Danielson Framework  competencies, Common Core standards, and ELL data to drive instruction.  This school year our focus is integrating a more  common and interdisciplinary curriculum, as suggested through our former Quality Review.  Teachers will be meeting one  Mondays twice a month to participate in PD activities to fulfill this goal.  PD activities include model lessons, book research,  teacher-action research, and video analysis. In addition, our MFSC, will be running PD sessions for our team to attend in  reference to ELLs. Our administration will be participating in monthly PD sessions through the Superintendent's office,  and outside organizations such as ADASA.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69         PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRAM : THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES MUST BE SUSTAINED AND ON- GOING.  IT MUST BE OF SUFFICIENT INTENSITY AND DURATION SO AS TO HAVE A LASTING IMPACT ON TEACHER PRACTICE  AFTER THE DOLLARS ARE GONE.  THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY MUST BE IN SUPPORT OF THE  TEACHERS/PRACTITIONERS WHO ARE PROVIDING THE TBE and ENL INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITY.  IT MAY ALSO INCLUDE A FEW  OTHERS FOR THE PURPOSE OF BUILDING CAPACITY.  In addition, our team will participate in our Bilingual Team PDs once a month. We have teachers from each content area on the  team, plus support and administrative staff. Teachers will be expected to search the web/internet for professional  development workshops specifically for the ELLs and their area of instruction.  Mrs. Delarosa will forward emails to the team  for PD opportunities.  They can also contact Office of DELLS & MFSC staff for PD information on EDAT, LAP, and Title III training  through News and PD Opportunities for Educators of ELLs.  They will be provided with invitations to attend workshops.  They  will attend monthly workshops that will further develop their communication skills and advocacy towards ELL and Bilingual  education.  The teachers that do not have the Bilingual Extensions will be encouraged to pursue them.  We recommend the  Intensive Teacher Institute Program. Teachers will receive professional development from NYC DOE which provide the skills to  scaffold instruction for the ELLs and on social cultural learning theory.  In addition, teachers will deepen student understanding  through a variety of instructional strategies and grouping configurations that will increase student participation and motivation  in school.  PD Sessions Suggested: MFSC, Office of DELLS, Annual LOTE Conference, ASCD Conference, Online Video Series on  Implementing ENL Strategies,  Research Based Inquiry Team sessions (monthly), Danielson Framework PD Committee (Monday  afternoons), and Individualized Danielson Framework Development for each teacher.  This year we also suggesting to teachers  to become member of ELL based organizations to participate in their PDs, such as NYSABE, ADASA, and ALAS, LATINO  CAUCUS.    We have used part of our school budget to purchase PD sessions from four companies that will be helping our staff with the  implementation of CASTLE LEARNING, STUDY ISLAND, NEWSELA, VOCABULARY.COM and GENIUS PLAZA.         2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Our administration, Bilingual Coordinator and PD Team provide PD for all teachers twice a month for a duration of 80 minutes  a month.  A PD calendar is provided that allows for teacher choice based on specific topics:  September: Contracts, student data and Danielson Framework  October: Grading policy and progress reports  November: Common assessments and Google-drive  December: Transcript and Regents skills  January: Attendance, programming and horizontal/vertical alignment  February: Credit recovery and student work  March: NYSESLAT and language aquisition   April: Parental Involvement and Collaboration  May: Scholarship data and unit plans  June: Promotion and graduation; next steps and goals         Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70         All parents will have one 1:1 meeting with our Bilingual Coordinator to discuss our TBE/ENL/DL programs; their child's  NYSITELL/NYSESLAT skills; Spanish LAB/SIFE results; and progress reports provided by teachers.  The majority of the time, this  meeting is held face-to-face; however, at times over the phone.  All parents speak Spanish, and 90% of our staff also speaks  Spanish.  There is an open-door policy in our school where parents are also invited to meet with the parent coordinator and/or  Principal to review their child's progress.  Our guidance counselors conduct their monthly meetings with specific families and  keep a detailed log on conversations, and next steps.  Our new FYI/CBO program staff also conducts meetings with parents in  reference to socio-emotional needs and next steps, and keeps the staff up to date on progress.      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   PC can lean in to write this; Computers, Genius Plaza grant for English classes, Financial Aid workshops, etc  The parents of ELL students are currently afforded the same parental involvement opportunities as our former- ELL  parents.  The same involvement will be provided to immigrant parents; however, they will be called in for special  services.  Parents are contacted regularly and included in all Parent Association functions.  We will continue to hold two major  meetings per year, one in the Fall and the other during the Spring.  In addition we will provide technology workshops for  immigrant parents to introduce them to Pupilpath, NYS transcript/grades/regents system and to our school’s website.  The  meetings and workshops will be conducted by our Bilingual/ELL Coordinator, Parent Coordinator and our Bilingual Team.  The  school’s secretaries will also send out letters - in their appropriate languages - offering other workshops or information on  school calendars, events, important test dates, exam preparation, after-school activities, cultural events, college readiness,  parenting skills, adult education opportunities, family health care, housing issues, immigration issues and other significant  topics.  The school's Parent Coordinator works closely with our Bilingual Coordinator on a monthly basis in the planning of the  monthly events for the parents.  The school is currently in the process of implementing software that will increase student  performance in content classes and ENL instruction.  There are four companies being accessed at the moment, as well as the  professional development portions, Genius Plaza, Edmentum Study Island, NEWSESLA, and CASTLE LEARNING.  Parents are also invited to our open-house hours on the last Monday of the month from 2:45 to 3:10 p.m. to visit their child's  teachers.  In addition, they are always invited to the Principal’s open-door policy office in Room 102; they can also email her at  ydelaro@schools.nyc.gov and/or call her at 2129281202.

You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.      Anything great to highlight/showcase our school    Gregorio Luperon for Science and Mathematics is a college preparatory high school that began as a means of serving the needs of  immigrants and English Language Learners.  All of the students in our ELL population speak Spanish as their first language.    Gregorio for Science and Math offers a full ninth through twelfth grade Bilingual Spanish Transitional Program.  In addition, we are  currently running a Freestanding ESL program for students that are commanding of the English language.  We have 16 teachers  that have ENL certifications and bilingual extensions.  The Bilingual Spanish Transitional Program consists of a Bilingual Living  Environment course, Bilingual Global History course and a Bilingual Math (algebra) course.  There are 125 ELL students per  grade.  For the most part we have good statistical data like 72% graduation rate; however, some of the students are struggling and  we are offering extra-support sessions before. after school and on Saturdays.  Teachers are also using resources like Spanish  content textbooks, assessments in both languages, software, glossaries and dictionaries for our students.  Our students also receive  one period of NLA services a day (215 min. a week) as well as ENL/English courses depending on their NYSESLAT scores.  A student  who scores in the Entering and Emerging levels will receive three periods of ENL a day or 645 minutes a week.  The students in the  expanding level will receive 2 periods of ENL a day or 430 minutes a week.  The students in the transitioning and commanding  levels will receive 1 period of ENL a day or 215 minutes a week, plus 1 period of English instruction a day or 215 minutes a  week.  We offer different types of ENL classes: double period reading and writing classes, single period grammar classes, literature  and advance socratic seminar classes.  We offer academic intervention services to all ELLs and former-Ells before and after-school, and Saturdays.  The small group  instructions will take place one to two days a week before or after school for two hours sessions beginning Nov 1 thru June 12,  2019.  The teachers will provide instruction that supports our ELL students in content area subjects to increase their performance  in the NYS Regents examinations.  Teachers will also provide instruction that supports their native language and their proficiency in  the English language.  Students will experience an extensive NYSESLAT workshop to increase their performance in the  NYSESLAT.  Some of these activities will be additionally supported through supplemental resources such as workbooks, dictionaries  and NYSESLAT leveled workbooks.  In addition our Bilingual students will have access to resources translated in Spanish.  There is an open door policy in the library for any ELL student that needs services Monday thru Friday.  Staff meetings during 0  period, and Parent Workshops will also take place here.  Special workshops for our newcomers and SIFE students will also take  place here.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.
