This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   We believe that every child is a unique individual who deserves a positive educational environment. Our staff delivers  the highest quality of teaching methods in a nurturing atmosphere focusing on each child growing and changing  needs. Our teachers and staff appreciate and care for all our students. In partnering with parents and students, we  foster a relationship of trust and respect. We do these things with pride. A child’s successful future is our goal.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9                                            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    P.S. 42 R is located in the town of Eltingville, which is on the South Shore of Staten Island. We are an elementary  school with 1052 students from Pre Kindergarten through Grade 5. Our student demographics are comprised of 1%  Black, 13% Hispanic, 76% White, 10% Asian. The student body includes 3% English language learners and 22%  Students with Special Needs. Our average student attendance rate for the school year is 95%, and our average  teacher attendance is 97%.      The dedicated faculty at P.S. 42 R is deeply involved in furthering their instructional practices and continues their own  learning which in turn, provides a real life model for students to do the same.      Based on the feedback provided in the 2015-2016 Quality Review, P.S. 42 R learned a Well Developed in establishing a  culture for learning that communicates high expectations to staff, students, and families, and provides supports to  achieve those expectations. At P.S. 42 R, a clear pathway of communication leads to a culture of mutual accountability  for staff and successful home-school partnerships towards college and career readiness for students. SQR findings  indicated that P.S. 42 R was proficient in ensuring engaging, rigorous, and coherent curricula in all subjects, accessible  for a variety of learners and aligned to Common Core Learning Standards and/or content standards. SQR evidence  also indicated that P.S. 42 R was proficient in aligning assessments to curricula, using on-going assessment and  grading practices, and analyzing information on student learning outcomes to adjust instructional decisions at the  team and classroom levels. Some of the challenges P.S. 42 R faces are in the areas of enhancing instruction to ensure  teachers strategically provide multiple entry points in lessons to engage students in challenging tasks that promote  critical thinking and ownership of their learning, and to further develop the connection between the observation and  feedback process so that professional growth and accountability is leveraged for pedagogical improvement.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10            3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   At PS42 R our special populations consist of Gifted & Talented and ENL.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   In order to address these challenges, our school community has placed great emphasis on the growth and  development of pedagogical skill through the use of learning networks. In order to enable the enhancement of  practice gained from strategically established collaborative bands, we implemented a vertically aligned instructional  cabinet to serve as a significant structure for improvement. The cabinet, consisting of both teachers and  administration, determines initiatives that best support our instructional focus and executes professionally organized  learning opportunities relevant to such initiatives and related goals. One specific area of focus identified by the  cabinet is the use of assessment in instruction (Danielson 3d). Cabinet members have provided ongoing professional  learning surrounding the use of formative-assessment and self-assessment in instruction throughout the year. The  cabinet seeks to continuously increase the effectiveness of instruction and to exercise leadership among colleagues,  impacting school-wide professional development and growth.   Our current goal is to broaden our use of collegial support systems by providing further opportunities for our  instructional cabinet to engage in networking that will significantly impact both the growth of content-based  knowledge and the development of pedagogical practices. Participation in the Learning Partners Program, Core  Collaborative Initiative, and the implementation of the Impact Team PLC Model will enable us to engage in  partnerships that will potentially build capacity for quality instruction aligned with our instructional focus and provide  additional support for our instructional cabinet by utilizing dynamics beyond our current limitations. Expanding  visitation will establish coherence as well, resulting in the establishment of newly refined expectations and the  integration of shared exemplary practices. Collectively, we are maximizing our learning time more efficiently through  the use of strategically planned professional development.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 31R042   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   1042   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

School Quality Review results indicate that Quality Indicator 3.4(high expectations) is an area of celebration at P.S. 42  R. P.S. 42 R scored 4.99 out of 4.99 and was rated well developed in establishing a culture for learning that  communicates high expectations to staff, students, and families, and provides supports to achieve those  expectations.   SQR findings indicate that school leaders consistently communicate high expectations to the entire staff and  implement systems of training. Effective communication provides support for families in understanding their child’s  progress towards school-wide expectations for learning. A clear pathway of communication leads to a culture of  mutual accountability for staff and successful home-school partnerships towards college and career readiness for  students. SQR findings also indicate that parents shared that the school provides multiple opportunities to help them  understand the expectations for learning towards the standards and how their children are progressing towards  them. Common Core Learning Standards workshops and in-class parent engagement activities provide families with  information on what students are learning and what strategies they can apply at home when their children exhibit  difficulty with an assignment. Furthermore, parents stated that the information provided by teachers via email,  phone calls and one-to-one meetings helps them support their children at home with homework. Lastly, the school  received an “Excellent” Rating for the movement of students with special needs to less restrictive environments on  the School Snapshot Report.      According to The Framework For Great Schools Report, P.S. 42 R scored 4.08 out of 4.99 in the Supportive  Environment Element of the Framework. The school scored well in the following subcategories of this element of the  Framework: 4.59 for safety, 3.51 for classroom behavior, 3.98 for peer support for academic work, 3.97 for social- emotional and 3.72 in academic press.      Based on the results of the Supportive Environment section of the NYC School Survey, 95% of parents/guardians  agreed or strongly agreed that their child's school will make them aware if there are any emotional or psychological  issues affecting their child's academic performance. Similarly, 97% of teachers surveyed responded positively about  questions regarding supportive environment in the School Quality Snapshot. For example, 100 % of teachers say that  students are safe in the hallways, bathrooms, locker room, and cafeteria. In addition, 90% of teachers say that adults  at the school teach students how to advocate for themselves. School Quality Snapshot results also indicate that 98%  of teachers say that students feel it is important to come to school every day.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          18         According to the School Environment Survey, 96 % of teachers feel that their students have to work hard to do well  and respond to challenging questions in class. Furthermore, 98% of teachers feel adults at P.S. 42 R teach critical  thinking skills to students and teach the skills needed to succeed in and be prepared for the next grade level.   Based on the Supportive Environment portion of the NYC Learning Environment Survey, 94% of parents indicated  that P.S. 42 R is responsive to parent feedback. To improve upon this success rate, we are developing an instructional  focus that will provide our students with the skills necessary to become self- directed learners. This will empower our  student population to be better prepared for college and careers. Our instructional focus will be that if our school  community reflects on our continuous collaborative professional learning with refined planning, then students will  be actively engaged in standards based rigorous learning experiences, as evidenced by student growth and a  personal commitment to excellence, that create opportunities for independent self- regulated learners. Based on our  school website needs assessment, only 80% of our staff regularly updates their class websites with links to support  student achievement at home. Model teachers will provide our staff with the necessary support to empower  teachers to enable students to access rigorous instructional materials outside the four walls of the classroom to  improve student achievement. Through peer support, teachers will learn how to embed tutorials in their class  websites to support struggling learners. Additionally, teachers will learn how to incorporate enrichment materials to  challenge students that excel. Pedagogues will learn how to incorporate an announcement section and calendar  describing current class activities, homework, and projects on the newly updated version of our E- Chalk website.   A “Spot the Extraordinary Student” Program is implemented to celebrate students’ accomplishments across the  grades on a monthly basis. This program will highlight the success of children emotionally and socially to prevent  bullying and boost self- confidence. A SAPIS Program is established to teach empathy, character education, social  involvement and anti-bullying. The implementation of the aforementioned programs will empower our school to  establish a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and  peers.

They have the opportunity to participate in professional  development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement.      Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.      P.S. 42 R received an overall score of 3.69 out of 4.99 in the Collaborative Teachers Element of the Framework for  Great Schools. The school scored well in the following subcategories of this component of the Framework according  to the result of the NYC Survey: 3.13 for cultural awareness and inclusive classroom instruction, 3.84 for the quality of  professional development, 3.70 for school commitment, 3.89 for innovation, 4.83.      P.S. 42 R has always been a collaborative working environment as evidenced by our Quality Review, Learning  Environment Surveys and PPO reports. The Elementary School Quality Snapshot indicates that P.S. 42 R was rated in  how well teachers collaboratively work with each other. According to the NYC School Survey report, 92% of teachers  indicated that they design instructional programs together and 96% make a conscious effort to coordinate their  teaching with instruction at other grade levels. Likewise, 96% of teachers specified that they are really trying to  improve their pedagogy. 92% of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that overall, their professional development  experiences this year have been sustained and coherently focused, rather than short-term and unrelated. 89% of  teachers agreed or strongly agreed that overall, their professional development experiences this year have included  enough time to think carefully about, try, and evaluate new ideas. 92% of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that  overall, their professional development experiences this year have included opportunities to work productively with  colleagues in their school.      Based on the Information Questions portion of the Learning Environment Survey, 83% of teachers indicated that  professional development at P.S. 42 R focused on Access for All Learners. In contrast, section 1.2 of the School Quality  Review Report indicated a need to enhance instruction to ensure teachers strategically provide multiple entry points  in lessons to engage students in challenging tasks that promote critical thinking and ownership of their learning.  Additionally, P.S. 42 R received a “fair” rating in the effective teaching and learning category based on the results of  the Elementary School Quality Snapshot. Through feedback provided by our school's Vertical Instructional Team, it  was determined that a single focus should be adopted for a three year study so that teachers can continue to  collaborate on the use of assessment in instruction (Danielson 3d) for an extended period of time. Through the use of  formative assessments, students will be empowered to access learning through multiple entry points.      According to the 2016 Framework for Great Schools Report, in the category “Student Achievement Rating” only 45.1%  of our student population met the Target of scoring at level 3 or 4 on the NYS ELA test. In contrast, 47.6% of students  met the targeted ELA percentage in the student comparison group. At P.S. 42 R, students underperformed the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          23      students in the ELA comparison group by 2.5%. Similarly, only 52.3% of our student population met the target of  scoring at level 3 or 4 on the N.Y. State Math Exam. In contrast, 56.2% of students met the Targeted Math percentage  in the student comparison group. At P.S. 42 R, students underperformed the students in the Math comparison group  by 3.9%. This demonstrates the need for our school to improve upon progress in relation to student achievement on  both the NYS ELA and Math exam by adopting an instructional focus that will empower our student population to be  better prepared for college and careers.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers.

P.S. 42 R has always been a collaborative working environment where the Principal and Assistant Principals lead by  example and cultivate the professional growth of teacher pedagogy, developing and providing the instructional and  social-emotional support that improves student achievement as evidenced by our Quality Review, Learning  Environment Surveys and Framework for Great Schools Report. P.S 42 R received an overall score of 3.58 out of 4.99  in the Effective School Leadership Element of the Framework. P.S. 42 R scored well in the following subcategories of  this Framework Element: 4.25 for inclusive leadership, 3.86 for program coherence and 3.51 for instructional  leadership. Additionally, SQR findings indicate that distributive leadership structures allow teachers to have a voice in  key decisions across the school. Furthermore, P.S. 42 R was rated good in the effective school leadership element of  the School Quality Snapshot. 84% of teachers surveyed responded positively to questions surrounding effective  school leadership.      In contrast, only 53% of teachers specified that they had influence over school policy in the area of developing  instructional practices. Additionally, only 73% of teachers indicated they had influence over school policy in the area  of selecting instructional materials used in classrooms. Furthermore, only 34% of staff indicated they had influence  over hiring new professional personnel. In order to increase “teacher voice” and enable the enhancement of  instructional practice gained from strategically established collaborative bands, we recognized the need to  implement a vertically aligned instructional cabinet to serve as a significant structure for improvement. Our current  goal is to broaden our use of collegial support systems by providing further opportunities for our instructional cabinet  to engage in networking that will significantly impact both the growth of content-based knowledge and the  development of pedagogical practices. In addition, our participation in the Learning Partners Program will enable us  to engage in partnerships that will potentially build capacity for quality instruction aligned with our instructional  focus and provide additional support for our instructional cabinet by utilizing dynamics beyond our current  limitations. Expanding visitation and the establishment of Impact Teams through our partnership with the Core  Collaborative Initiative will establish coherence as well, resulting in the establishment of newly refined expectations  and the integration of shared exemplary practices. Establishing a Human Resource Committee will increase teacher  voice in the selection of new school personnel. All of the aforementioned results indicate that our school also needs  to further develop the connection between the observation and feedback process so that professional growth and  accountability is leveraged for pedagogical improvement.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          27                    Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership.

The school scored well in the following subcategories of this Framework Element: 4.00 for  outreach to parents and 4.47 for parent involvement in the school. Based on section 3.4 of the School Quality Review  report P.S. 42 R received a rating of “Well Developed” and the principal is regarded as a reflective and supportive  leader who cultivates a respectful and inclusive environment of trust, resulting in the adoption of effective academic  and personal behaviors for both staff and students.       SQR findings indicate that effective communication provides support for families in understanding their child’s  progress towards school-wide expectations for learning. Additional SQR findings indicate that a clear pathway of  communication leads to a culture of mutual accountability for staff and successful home-school partnerships  towards college and career readiness for students.      Moreover, in an effort to support improved student outcomes and to promote the adoption of effective academic  and personal behaviors, the school works determinedly to align outreach efforts to support the developmental and  academic needs of all students. An active Parent Teacher Association supports the school’s instructional goals  through contributions of funding to advancements in student learning through field trips to the Liberty and Buehler  Science Center, Broadway. Trips to these cultural institutions are linked to units of study, and student team-building  assemblies, supporting the school’s focus on developing the whole child. Moreover, parents describe the school  environment as one that is fully supportive of their children both academically and emotionally.   NYC School Survey results revealed that 98% of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that, at their school, school staff  regularly communicate with parents/guardian about how parents/guardians can help students learn. Additionally,  based on the Learning Environment Survey, only 80% of P.S. 42 R parents indicated that they have been invited to an  event at their child’s school (workshop, program, performance, etc.). In order to deepen family connections, the  Vertical Instructional Team recognized the need to offer families the same professional development that teachers  are being offered. As a result, workshops surrounding Common Core Standards will be executed by teachers  exhibiting areas of expertise, subsequently bridging gaps in school/home connectivity.            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          31       Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. 31R042, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      31R042 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the ESSA;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

All instruction will be in English  with any parent information and training sent home in their preferred language.  The school will  utilize the services of the Translation and Interpretation Unit for this home language  support.  The after-school program will begin on Wednesday, November 7 and end on Thursday,  May 9. The classes will run on Wednesday and Thursday afternoons from 2:40-4:10. Mrs. Six  and Mrs. Ceraulo the ESL/ENL teachers, will teach the class, and these classes are for grades K- 2 on Wednesdays and 3-5 on Thursdays. They are available to students of all proficiency  levels.  On the 2018 NYSESLAT exam, 19 students scored expanding, 3 students scored  transitioning, 3 scored emerging and 1 scored entering.  We will utilize the ReadingA-Z (The  Complete Collection), purchased through the company LearningA-Z.  This program is  supplemental and distinct from those used in daily instruction. This program was chosen to allow  students of all levels to move at their own pace and work on the five key areas of reading  instruction--phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension.  This  program is a result of students under-performing on reading assessments that determine their  independent reading levels. In grades K-2, very few students are receiving level 3 in reading and  writing. .  This application will be used to expose these newcomers to Tiers I, II and III  vocabulary in addition to supporting their reading and writing skills. While many students show  progress on the NYSESLAT exams, they are not gaining proficiency at a satisfactory rate  (AMAO 2).  Additionally, these students are not meeting the criteria to satisfy AMAO III when  it comes to the NYS exams.  Not a single ESL/ENL student achieved a level 3 or higher on  the2017 NYS ELA exam,. The 2018 exam results have nit yet been released.  Therefore, in  addition to the ReadingA-Z program, the students in grades 3-5 will have access to test prep  materials to be used at home and during the after-school program.  The supplemental and distinct  materials to be purchased will be from Continental Press, a new program called TEAM which is  completely separate from the materials used for daily instruction.  This program focuses on  academic language for all grades, K-2 and 3-5. Additionally, we will purchase a subscription for  BrainPop ESL to enhance the grammar and writing for the students in grades 3-5. All records,  including student attendance and program notifications will be maintained by Mrs. Six.

The opportunities that Mrs. Six, the ENL teacher of the  after school program, will utilize are the self-paced webinars.  Since Mrs. Six is the only teacher  providing instruction in the after-school program, it will not be necessary to provide other  teachers with professional development. Additionally, Mrs. Six will navigate the various features  of the new programs, BrainPop ESL and TEAM to maximize their benefits.    The specific webinars/ learning opportunities to be viewed/studied are:    1. ReadingA-Z webinars Wednesday, October 17, 2018 2:40-3:40 p.m.  2.

They will allow the instructor to maximize the effectiveness of the subscription and  ultimately have a positive impact on the progress of the ELL students. The only cost to the  program will be the three hours of per session to the teacher participating in the webinars.  As the  program progresses, there are other available webinars that can be viewed if  necessary.  Additionally, if we do not feel that we are able to utilize all of the features to their  fullest capacity, we will inquire with the company about an on-site professional learning session  with the ENL teacher. The agendas as well as notes and other relevant information regarding  these sessions will be submitted to Mrs. Aileen Dulski, the assistant principal.

Specifically,  how to use the student and parent features. Since the content is delivered entirely online, the  resources can be easily accessed at home, allowing parents to read with their students and  participate in their daily learning.  Additionally, there are parental login features. Parents can  quickly view their student's progress on digital assignments and leave notes of encouragement  for their child.  We are switching to a new math program this year and parents will benefit from  learning the nuances of the new program so that they may help their children at home.  The parents will be notified of the professional learning opportunities via letters, phone calls and  emails.  These methods of communication will be in their preferred languages of communication  and will be translated by the Translation and Interpretation Unit or by staff members whenever  possible.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Currently the school is using Fountas and Pinnell in addition to teacher-created assessments for instructional planning for our  ELLs. The ENL teachers work with classroom teachers to create appropriate assessments for the various proficiency levels of  ELLs based on the Common Core Learning Standards. The school utilizes the scores from the NYSESLAT modalities to guide  instructional planning as well. The math curriculum, GoMath, is aligned with the common core standards. All units are aligned  with standards-based assessments which allows teachers to analyze each student's work and focus on areas of concern for  future instruction. Also, Pearson's ReadyGen Literacy Series, provides students with standards based instruction. The  Danielson framework/model is our method of instructional guidelines.  Our reading program contains rich, meaningful and  informational texts on every grade.ReadyGen  utilizes the "introduce, model, teach and practice modalities which offer  checkpoint assessments which allows a short evaluation after a lesson.   ReadyGen  utilizes the "introduce, model, teach and  practice modalities which offer checkpoint assessments which allows a short evaluation after a lesson.   The data from these  assessments indicates that students need more assistance with phonemic awareness and retelling in the lower grades. When   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      assessing reading in the upper grades, students have difficulty making inferences based on the text.  In math, more emphasis  needs to be placed on academic vocabulary.  This will be addressed by incorporating meaningful language objectives into  every lesson.  Based on the NYSESLAT results, writing is the weakest area across the board. On the 2017 NYSESLAT, all 29  students tested had the lowest raw scores on the writing portion of the exam.  This data confirms the need to focus on writing  across the content areas and grade levels.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   In order to support this effort, the school mandates that all students are assessed in their reading levels five times a year:  September, November, January, March and May. Students are given word study lessons, which adhere to learning and  applying phonological awareness on a daily basis. In the early childhood grades, students are assessed on their sight word  recognition as well as their ability to understand reading comprehension questions and answer accordingly. Grade meetings  have been planned for twice a week for each grade for analyzing data including formal/informal assessments and  summative/formative and student work. Each grade will identify the focus aims, skills/sub skills, and set long/short term goals.  Progress is also monitored through interim assessments to ensure progression is being sought and goals are being achieved. If  needed, instructional practice/aims will be adjusted. School leadership ensures that staff is implementing the structures  addressing the needs of the ELLs by providing common planning time with the ENL teachers and the classroom teachers  throughout the year.  Additionally, the ENL teachers will provide professional learning opportunities for their colleagues to  learn about best practices for ELLs in the classroom.  During observations, school leadership looks to ensure that lessons  contain differentiation for English Language Learners based on their proficiency level (ex. total physical response, visuals,  reference sheets and graphic organizers). The ENL teacher has access to ATS and prints important reports monthly.  NYSESLAT  results are printed the first week of school and these are used to program students correctly.  The ENL and classroom teachers  receive the scores from the NYS ELA and math exams.  They use this data to study trends and make academic decisions to  provide ELLs with the necessary report.  School wide, math scores are down this year and this will be a focus for our ELL  students as well.  We will incorporate more deliberate instruction of academic vocabulary across the content areas to fill in the  gaps.             3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  In order to address the summative data, there are interventions in place. By providing differentiated instruction, lessons are  altered in order to meet the needs of each student. The students are given manipulatives, graphic organizers, visual aids, peer  assisted learning strategies, and small group instruction with either the ENL or classroom teacher. We utilize the TCWRP as the  baseline assessments for reading and teacher created assessments to determine students' strengths and weaknesses in ELA  and math.  Students take math tests at the end of each chapter, but they also perform tasks daily, to monitor their  understanding of the math concepts.  Their progress on these assessments allows the teachers to group the children properly  and provide necessary clarity or enrichment.  Some areas of needs for ELLs is writing and/or telling responses based on what  they read.  Another area of need is solving word problems and applying the math to real world situations.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    The school uses the summative data to provide interventions. At first the ENL and classroom teacher plan lessons that are  scaffolded with best pedagogic practices for ELLs embedded in them.  If the students continue to lack progress , they will  receive tier II interventions with the classroom and/or ENL teachers. During this time the students will work in small groups  with their peers in order to work on the skills necessary to meet the grade- appropriate Common Core Learning  Standards.  This is determined when the teachers meet to discuss the students' progress and possibly during the monthly PPT  meeting.  Quite often service providers such as speech and SETSS provide strategies that can be implemented by the ENL and  classroom teachers.  The strategies are implemented and students' progress is continually monitored through more formal and  informal assessments.       5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   As noted in the RtI guide, a tremendous emphasis is placed on strengthening the Tier I instruction of our ELLs. The ENL  teachers will work closely with the classroom teacher to provide instruction that takes ELLs into consideration.  If the students   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56         continue to show a struggle, an investigation of native language literacy ability is conducted.  If the child has an ability to read  in his or her native language, they are encouraged to further develop these skills in conjunction with their English reading  skills.  If no native literacy exists, Tier 2 instruction is provided by either the ENL or classroom teacher. . These students are  recommended for AIS.  The AIS classes are small group and organized by category, such as reading and/or writing.  Students  are placed into their appropriate classes based on TCWRP, performance tasks and various other forms of hard and soft  data.   T     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   ELLs are given the NYSITELL after undergoing the ELL Identification Process. The NYSITELL determines their leveled placement  and mandate for the school year. The NYSESLAT is administered  once a year at the end of the school year. It is given in four  components: Listening, Reading, Writing and Speaking. The ELLs are evaluated by their performance on these tests which are  divided by five levels: Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding and Commanding. These levels range from the beginner to  advanced levels which allocate the mandated services for each student. Based on the data from these assessments, we decide  which areas are in the greatest need for improvement. Every student, with the exception of one, received his or her lowest  score on the writing portion of the exam. This is an indication that more emphasis must be placed on writing in the  classroom.                 7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   In September, during a Monday PD session, the ENL teachers meet with the administration and classroom teachers to discuss  the results from the NYSESLAT. They use the RLAT report in addition to other data sources to identify student trends. This year  we noticed that speaking and listening are still the strongest areas for most students, except newcomers. We also noticed that  across the board, writing was the weakest area.  We use the data from the NYSITELL to place students in classes with their ELL  peers, as well as program their ENL services. ELL students in grades 3, 4 and 5 are performing below grade level when  compared to their peers in ELA. In math, many students are on par with their peers, although school-wide math scores did  decline this year. In 2016, out 0f 10 ELLs tested on the NYS ELA exam, none were proficient. 30% of these students received a  level 1 on the exam and 70 % received a level 2. In 2017, 56% of the students received a level 1 on the exam while 44% of the  students scored a level 2. The number of students who received a level 1 was significantly higher than the non-ELLs. In 2016 on  the NYS math exam, , 18% of the ELLs tested scored proficiently versus 57% on the non-ELLs. In 2017 the number of  ELLs scoring proficient on the math exam decreased to 15% versus 54% from their non-ELL peers. This data is concerning, and  leads us to believe we need to revisit the importance of academic vocabulary across all content areas.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   On each grade level ELLs are placed in the same class whenever possible.  This allows for easy integrated teaching  opportunities.  They are placed in heterogeneous groups based on grade level. All students that are transitioning,  expanding and commanding receive their mandated minutes of instruction through integrated teaching with their  classroom teacher and the ENL teacher. The ENL teacher collaborates with the classroom teacher to plan lessons and  objectives that are conducive to all students, especially ELLs.    Students who are entering and emerging receive half  of their instruction through integrated instruction, as discussed above, and the other half through standalone ENL  instruction provided by the ENL teacher. During standalone ENL instruction, students are grouped homogeneously in  the sense they are either entering or emerging. The ENL teacher works with these students in a separate location.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57         During this time she works with the students on the areas they need improvement. This data come from  NYSESLAT and NYSITELL scores as well as formal and informal assessments given in the classroom. Technology is  integrated whenever possible, as well as multiple opportunities for students to engage in discussions with peers in a  risk-free environment.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     At this time the school does not currently have a TBE program.   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      At this time the school does not currently have a Dual Language program.   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              All instruction is in English.  In order to ensure that the number of mandated instructional minutes is being provided, the  ENL teacher will collaborate with the classroom teachers to provide integrated instruction to two contiguous grades at a  time.  Entering and emerging students receive 180 minutes of integrated instruction as well as 180 minutes of standalone ENL  minutes.  Transitioning and expanding students receive 180 minutes of integrated instruction.  Commanding students receive  90 minutes of integrated instruction. School leadership ensures that all students are receiving their mandated number of  minutes via STARS programming. The ENL teachers' schedules for each students are entered into STARS and the number of  minutes is cross-referenced with their proficiency levels. In addition, administration receives monthly reports from the  Borough Support Field office containing information regarding student programming. They review the data and make any  necessary adjustments to rectify the situation.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      Core content is delivered in English in each program model through units of study covering a variety of topics in various  subject areas.  Students will learn through techniques proven to work with ELLs such as reciprocal teaching, scaffolding,  modeling and peer interaction.  All lessons are grade appropriate and based on the Common Core Learning Standards and will  be planned using the SIOP model. Teachers use strategies such as TPR, realia, visuals, technology, paraphrasing, differentiation  of tasks and assessments. ELLs will meets the demands of the NYS Learning Standards because all lessons, tasks and  assessments are created and implemented based on these standards.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      Whenever applicable students will be evaluated in their home languages through the use of translated materials and  qualified translators.          5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a. Currently P.S. 42 does not have any SIFE students.  However, if a student is admitted and identified as a SIFE, the SIFE Oral  Interview Questions and other guidance documents from the NYSED.gov website such as the MLS Screener, Writing  Screener and placement flowchart  Additionally, a program will be developed to attend to the student's academic and social  needs based on their educational and family history.  Additionally, if possible, any community organizations that will be  beneficial to the family will be contacted.Once a student is performing at at transitioning level, they will no longer be  considered a SIFE.     b.  Newcomers are initially assessed with the NYSITELL and then the NYSESLAT.  Many newcomers enter the school nervous   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      about their inability to verbally communicate their needs and fears to teachers. As  a result, the ENL teacher and the classroom  teacher implement routines, pictures and other visuals for students to use as cues for their feelings and needs. Then,  simultaneously, the four modalities are introduced.  Sound production and phonetics are stressed. Content area vocabulary is  introduced through literature and visuals.  The balanced-literacy approach is employed at all stages of development and  Common Core Learning Standards are implemented.      c.  Students who are developing receive services for four to six years are provided with the following:  *inclusion in academic after-school program   *push-in/pull-out AIS- skills- based according to deficiency  *Continuous collaboration among the ESL teacher and classroom teachers. Discussions are based on best practices for ELLs.  Time is provided by the administration for teachers to collaborate.     d. Students who receive services for more than six years  (Long Term ELLs) are provided with the following:( In the event that a  student is held over)   *inclusion in academic after-school program   *push-in/pull-out AIS skills- based according to deficiency  *Continuous collaboration among the ESL teacher and classroom teachers. Discussions are based on best practices for ELLs.  *Referrals may be made to the School Assessment Team to screen children for learning disabilities which may prevent them  from passing the NYSESLAT.  Additionally, the ELAND team may further investigate the student's abilities and language skills.  e.  Students who test proficiently on the NYSESLAT continue to receive support for two years after they pass the exam.  In the  testing grades they will continue to receive additional time, a separate location and use a bilingual glossary.  They are also  entitled to the above mentioned programs that are available to the current ELLS, specifically 90 minutes a week of integrated  ENL services.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   The ESL teacher, along with all other service providers in the school, have access to SESIS and review and abide by the  mandates of the students' IEPs.  Students who have ESL on their IEPs receive the appropriate ESL programming.  Teachers of  ELL-SWDs utilize grade-level materials that are provided by Pearson's Ready-Gen and Go Math programs.  These programs are  completely aligned to the CCLS and challenge all students, but especially the ELL-SWDs.  In order to accelerate English language  development, teachers supplement these materials with technology, images and leveled readers on the same topics discussed  in the curriculum.  Academic and content specific vocabulary is pre-taught and reinforced often.            7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  The ESL teacher is versed on the various and specific needs of all students, and has access to all of their IEP goals.  She works in  conjunction with the classroom teacher as well as the other service providers to enable students to meet their goals.  In  accordance with the mandated school curriculum, students receive targeted, skill-based instruction. In order to work around  the often hectic service schedule of the ELL-SWD, the ESL teacher conducts heterogeneous groups and differentiates within  the lesson.   These students are always in ESL class with their non-disabled peers.  The addition of a second ENL teacher has  allowed us to keep the ELL-SWD children with their classes and receive push-in instruction in their own  environments.  Depending on the evaluations and opinions of the teachers and school assessment teams, some ELL-SWDs are  placed in ICT classes if that appears to be in the best interest of the student.   ll lessons are grade appropriate and based on the  Common Core Learning Standards and will be planned using the SIOP model. Teachers use strategies such as TPR, realia,  visuals, technology, paraphrasing, differentiation of tasks and assessments based on the specific needs as dictated on the  IEP.           8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      The targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math and other content areas include SETSS, A.I.S. (Academic Intervention  Services- Title I) .  The largest ELL subgroup is ELL-SWD.  These children participate in intervention programs, as indicated in  their IEPs.  All services are in English.  The range of services and the content areas are targeted as indicated by student needs'  assessments.  Students are placed in subgroups based on decoding, fluency, reading comprehension, computation and  problem solving. ELL students in all subgroups will receive help (as needed) by teachers trained in Orton- Gillingham, as well as  a new program in grades K-3 called Recipes for Reading. We are also focusing on academic language across all content areas  due to lower performances on NYS assessments.               9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      In terms of new programs, we are not currently planning on any new ones. To make improvements, the ENL teacher will work  closely with the classroom teachers to plan lessons using the SIOP model.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   The school has never had a bilingual program.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All services and supplemental services during and after school are offered to all children.  Translators are provided and letters  sent home to parents are provided in their native language to keep them informed of school business.  ELLs are encouraged to  participate in our after school program.  The S.T.A.R. program (Students, teachers and recreation) helps to promote social skills  as well as academic skills and homework help.  As part of our everyday curricular activities, ELLs are encouraged to participate  in all student activities such as G.O. elections, school monitors, fund raising drives, special assemblies and other community  activities. A Title III after-school program is offered two days a week after school focusing on reading and writing as well as  socialization.We are also going to incorporate STEAM activities to enrich the program. Leadership ensures that all ELLs have  access to these programs by sending home translated materials to the parents.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  This year, P.S. 42 has adopted Pearson's ReadyGen and Go Math curricula. Kindergarten-Grade 3 is using Recipe for Reading.  Within these programs, students are upheld to the rigorous common core standards.  They are assessed using performance  tasks and on-demand writing pieces.  Additionally, teachers utilize leveled readers and technology in the classroom. Every  room has an interactive whiteboard, desktop computers and some have iPads.  The school also has a BrainPop Jr. account to  supplement lessons and work on listening skills of students.     The school has also purchased a subscription for Raz Kids that  provides reading support and translates parent materials for teachers to send home. ELLs of all subgroups utilize these  instructional materials in conjunction with teacher created resources to supplement the programs and support the ELLs.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   In the classrooms, students are able to use bilingual glossaries for math, social studies and science.  Additionally, there are  native language reading books available for independent reading.        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All ELLs are placed according to age.  Once in a grade, they are instructed using grade level material.  Reading materials are age  appropriate and supplemental materials are used to enhance students' skills based on assessments and reading levels.     All  ELLs are placed according to age.  Once in a grade, they are instructed using grade level material.  Reading materials are age  appropriate and supplemental materials are used to enhance students' skills based on assessments and reading levels.  The  ENL teachers' schedules for each students are entered into STARS and the number of minutes is cross-referenced with their  proficiency levels. In addition, administration receives monthly reports from the Borough Support Field office containing  information regarding student programming. They review the data and make any necessary adjustments to rectify the  situation.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    The school does not share a building.      16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Although there is no formal program in our school prior to the beginning of the school year, we house a self-sustaining  vacation day camp and enrollment is open to all.  For students who enroll throughout the year, we offer them free placement  in our after school activities to promote socialization and language development as well as academic support through their  homework.  This is a collaboration among the ENL teacher, the parent coordinator and the STAR Program staff of teachers and  paraprofessionals. There will be a title III after school program available to all ELLs. The program will utilize Raz Kids and other  technology to help strengthen their core reading skills. For students in grade 5 entering middle school we encourage  attendance at the open houses as well as provide counseling and life skills through our SAPIS worker, Ms. Mancusi.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    The school does not currently offer any language electives.        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   The school does not currently have a dual language program.     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Professional development will be offered to teachers and paraprofessionals during the Monday afternoon sessions on a  monthly basis.  Additionally, the ESL teacher will attend grade meetings the first Monday of the month to discuss ELL related  topics such as: identification of ELLs, using Q-TEL strategies in the classroom, cultural sensitivity, and ELLs and content area  instruction.  The ENL teacher will collaborate with the grade assistant principals to provide PD to the entire staff once a month.  The following topics have been tentatively scheduled for these meetings to be held from 2:35-3:55 p.m.:  These may be replaced once SIOP training is attended by the ENL teacher  September ,  2017- The ELL Identification Process and NYSITELL and Cultural Sensitivity   December , 2017- CR Part 154  January , 2018- CCLS and the implications for ELLs  February, 2018- Best Practices for ELLs in the Content Area  March , 2018-Unpacking the NYSESLAT   April , 2018- RtI for ELLs  May , 2018- Reciprocal Teaching  There will be monthly meetings on a Monday afternoon in which all teachers of ELLs will attend to discuss successful and  unsuccessful strategies that they have tried in their classrooms.  They will plan and discuss next steps to propel success for  their students regarding the CCLS.  Additionally, the administration will seek out and invite experts in the field of language  acquisition.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61         2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  The ENL teacher will be attending a SIOP training in August 2017.  This training will allow the teacher to turnkey these  strategies to the staff. This will occur the first or second Monday of each month (pending holidays).  The other Mondays the  ENL teachers will engage in professional book studies using publications geared toward differentiation as well as best practices  for ELLs. These professional book studies will be used to plan additional professional development for the staff. Agendas,  attendance sheets and reflection sheets will be utilized.  They will also participate in Webinars on EngageNY. Records will be  kept by the teachers as well as the payroll secretary.  The rest of the staff will receive training by the ENL teachers one Monday  or Tuesday a month and on Election Day to satisfy the 15 hour requirement as per CR 154.2.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   The ENL teacher will utilize Tuesday afternoons (2:35-3:50 p.m.) in September and October to provide initial annual individual  meetings with parents of ELLs. These meetings will include the students' classroom teachers whenever possible.  When  necessary, the school will utilize staff or other qualified translators to ensure that all goals and program expectations are  clear.  Any paperwork that needs to be translated will be done through The Office of Translation and Interpretation. Anyone in  attendance at the meetings will be given an agenda and sign an attendance sheet. Additionally, In May the parents will be  invited to another meeting on those Tuesday afternoons (or other times during the school day that are convenient for the  parents). These meetings will allow the teachers, parents and students to create goals for the following school year.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Parents of all students, including parents of ELLs, are very much involved and engaged through parent-teacher conferences  (translators are provided when necessary via staff members), PTA meetings, parent workshops on CCLS planned and facilitated  by the parent coordinator and curriculum meetings facilitated by the math/literacy coach.  Whenever possible, all notification  and information is sent home in the native language.  This December, the parent coordinator and the ENL teachers are  preparing to host a school-wide multicultural holiday experience. We feel that this is an excellent bonding experience for the  school community, ELL and non-ELL families alike.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Brian Sharkey, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   P.S. 042 Eltingville                                                                              School DBN: 31R042  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

When a parent or guardian registers a student, they complete the HLIS. On the HLIS they indicate their preferred  language for written and oral communication. On any forms that are not readily available in translated versions,  the school utilizes the Office of Translation and Interpretation. Pedagogues will utilize the translation line for  lower incidence languages as well. Additionally, paraprofessionals are utilized to translate in both oral and written  situations such as parent meetings, emergency school notices and report cards.           2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community.
