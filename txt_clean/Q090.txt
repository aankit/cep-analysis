This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   All students will have an equal opportunity to become lifelong learners and responsible, productive and caring  members of our multi-ethnic and culturally diverse family and tolerant of each others' differences through the team  effort of home, school and community. We will continue to provide a safe and nurturing environment for all. We will  create an enriched curriculum and instruction that is driven by data and differentiated to meet the needs of all  students. Implementation of student engagement and independence that leads to college and career readiness and  create student independence that ensures educational mastery for all.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    School Background   The entire school community strives to achieve a high standard of academic excellence in all subjects and provide our  students with the skills necessary to prepare them to be college and career ready. With the full implementation of the  Common Core aligned curriculum (Teachers College/GO Math), the school continues to place a strong focus on  literacy and math.   In ELA, we are committed to establishing a culture of learning that is grounded in a love of reading, the ability to use  texts to acquire information, and opportunities for students to express their understanding and thoughts through  writing. Teachers college provides us with a framework for literacy instruction, upon which we build. This program  helps us provide learning experiences in literacy that allow students to utilize strategies that will help them reflect on  and practice their reading behaviors in order to become better readers. With that said, we take into account the  various needs of our students who are working towards this goal. All classrooms have a wide range of texts which  reflect a balance of both informational and literary genres. In grades K-2, teachers use Fundations to enhance  students' phonemic awareness. Teachers engage students in literacy lessons that are CCLS aligned and incorporate  the balanced literacy model, with significant attention given to independent and guided reading. Guided reading and  literature circles allow teachers to work with students on their instructional levels and in small group settings.  Students work during guided and independent reading periods to strengthen their reading skills so that they will be  able to in time, tackle grade level texts on their own. Across the school there is a focus on writing for a variety of  purposes such as, informational, narrative, and persuasive. Students use various types of graphic organizers to  capture text based information and to plan their writing. Students in all grades consistently use rubrics and checklists  to peer and self-evaluate their work. Professional Learning Communities (PLC’s) work collaboratively to reflect on  student performance and teacher practice to make the necessary adjustments to the curriculum and evaluative tools  such as performance tasks, which helps to ensure college and career readiness.   In Math, teachers follow a workshop model for instruction in which whole group lessons are followed up with  independent practice as well as small group instruction that targets the needs of all learners. We follow the Go Math  program as the basis of our planning, curriculum, scope, and sequence. Whole group lessons are planned to engage  all students and introduce concepts through modeled instruction. Often this is done through a multimedia approach.  While lessons are thoroughly planned with all students’ needs and abilities in mind, we welcome “on the spot”  decisions/modifications based on our teacher observations and regular formative assessments. As we work according  to a pacing calendar, adjustments are made throughout the year, which help us to ensure that all students have  mastered concepts necessary for success with their grade. Small group instruction time may be used to review  concepts that were not mastered the first time around, to provide enrichment opportunities for students who  understand the content, and to work with students who have special needs. All lessons are grounded in problem  solving. At P.S. 90Q, problem solving is at the core of all math instruction as we prepare our students for college and  career readiness. Strategies are modeled in all lessons and students are given opportunities to work in small groups to  discuss, work through, and solve problems together. Teachers attend out of school workshops and turnkey new  information and ideas to staff on a regular basis. We are currently working towards implementing some math  problem solving structures and routines that will help us build more coherent practices throughout the building. We  continue to look for ways to provide professional learning opportunities in math to help us improve practice, manage  time, and meet the needs of individuals and small groups.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      We have branded our school to highlight our strengths. We are known as the Home of Exploration, Arts, Respect and  Technology. We regularly emphasize exploration and problem solving in our classrooms. One example of this is our  implementation of a hands-on approach through STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics)  challenges. by Our school was awarded a grant with Disney, which allowed us to hold a production of the Jungle Book.  Students performed this multiple times at the school and were given the opportunity to perform part of the musical  on Broadway as well. This grant with Disney will continue for two more years. Our students also participate in a  chorus group that meets weekly. They were able to showcase their talents at the Apollo theater. We also began  implementing Sanford Harmony, a social emotional learning program in order to cultivate strong relationships among  the student body. With the recent addition of Promethean Boards, laptops, and iPads, our students are able to  enhance their coding skills by navigating various programs.    We consider ourselves a community of learners and reflective practitioners at P.S. 90Q. Throughout the school year,  we work as a team to evaluate our progress toward meeting our goals. Goals are chosen to guide us in pursuit of  success for all students. We build strong relationships with parents and the community, a sense of a safe and  nurturing environment for all, an enriched curriculum and instruction that is differentiated to meet the needs of all  students, and a vehicle of planning professional development at all levels. During different meetings, such as teacher  teams, groups of staff analyze student work and student needs to adjust instruction/lessons as needed, and record  this information on differentiated instruction sheets (DI) to document achievement. This process is completed in all  subject areas.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   P.S. 90Q is an elementary school with 814 students from Pre-Kindergarten through grade 5. The school is made up of  3.93% Black, 56.88% Hispanic, 3.93% White, 2.33% American Indian/ Alaskan Native and 31.45% Asian students. The  student body includes 23.46% English Language Learners and 17.57% Students with Disabilities . P.S. 90Q continues to  look for ways to close the achievement gap between all special student populations. We continue to focus on ELL’s  and the Students with Disabilities population to close the achievement gap. According to the 2016-2017 School  Report Card, students in these populations did not meet our Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) in ELA.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Our 2017-2018 School Environment Survey indicates that staff feels we have aligned our math curriculum to meet the  standards in the best ways possible. We will continue to do this with our new Algebra for All initiative, using problem  solving strategies across the grades, and encouraging our students to persevere through complex problems.    Our Survey also indicated that we have made some growth in our family community ties. Parents feel the school  keeps them involved in their child's progress and growth. They also feel that their children's teachers involve them in  meeting their individual child's needs.    The School Environment Survey states that teachers feel that students struggle to build on each others' ideas during  classroom discussion. We will continue to work on building student independence in classroom discussions by using  book clubs and providing several opportunities for students.    According to our School Environment Survey, trust between teachers seems to have become an area of concern.  Although teachers do collaborate, there is still a lack of trust amongst colleagues. It also indicates that teachers feel  that other teachers are hesitant to accept new ideas. Our goal with offering a variety of professional development is  that teachers will feel more comfortable to ask questions and engage with the new material.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

Budget and  resource alignment        1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS90Q, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      PS90Q will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level (e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology);   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding city, state and federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings, and other activities in a format and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills, and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community.      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parental involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.          In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, assessment expectations; literacy; accessing community and support services; and technology  training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, (e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;    ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the ESSA;    ● schedule additional parent meetings, (e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening), to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions and feedback;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;       The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are given periodically to keep parents informed of their child’s  progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the parent/guardian in a  format and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand;   ● hosting Meet and Greet Night in September;   ● Family Literacy Night;    ● Title 1 Parent Involvement (e.g., kaleidoscope workshop, Build- a- Bear, and Book Club);   ● Annual Science Fair;    ● Informative Parent Night in May (getting ready for next year);      ●  Host wellness events for parents and students;      ● STEM workshops;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41         ● Disney theater productions          School-Parent Compact (SPC)   PS90Q, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is  implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between  the school and the families.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Assessments can provide important information to help guide and inform instruction. Informal assessment consists of the  evidence teachers collect in class on a continuous basis to measure the progress of their students in mastering the skills and  content taught. It provides continuous feedback to students, teachers, and parents. Each student is compared to his/her own  prior level of achievement, as well as to peer groups.   NYSITELL is  the State test we use to determine initial entitlement. Students receive instruction in English with native language  support in freestanding ENL programs throughout the school year.  In spring students take NYSESLAT, a test that measures the  English proficiency of ELLs and determines their progress as well as their continued entitlement or exit from entitlement. Since  students receive ENL services and other intervention services they are expected to show progress academically.       P.S. 90 uses DRA to assess the early literacy skills of ELL’s.  Skills assessed are student's phonics and comprehension skills, as  well as student's' ability to identify words and letters. Initially, it is not uncommon that ELL's score lower than our native  language speakers due to fact that they are acquiring a second language. Data from DRA and as well as NYSITELL and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      NYSESLAT scores guide freestanding ESL instructions as the ENL teachers focus on vocabulary, fluency and language  enrichment. Overall, we have found that our ELL students make progress at a relatively quick rate in the earlier levels (A-E) of  the DRA.  As students test on higher levels progress tends to decline or slow down, as higher order thinking, critical analysis  and comprehension demands increase. We continue to work towards ELA instruction in which phonics and comprehension are  equally paired. Classroom discussions, close readings and modeled critical thinking strategies are used to help improve  comprehension.          2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The ENL teachers are strategically placed in teacher teams to collaborate and provide support in ensuring ELL success.  ENL  teachers share NYSITEL and NYSESLAT data with classroom teachers and provide strategies that promote language acquistion.  ENL teachers attend citiwide ENL PD's and turnkey the knowledge. Two ENL teachers are on the PD committee and actively  advocate for  ELL students.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  P.S. 90 uses different assessments and data to evaluate the success of the freestanding ENL program for ELL’s. ENL teachers  analyze data from NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, Periodic ELL Assessments, State tests as well as DRA’s to appraise ELL’s standings. DRA  results demonstrate that ELL’s reading levels are improving in accordance with their language proficiency levels. Based on the  review of the all tests, the freestanding ENL program at P.S. 90 is very successful. NYSESLAT results indicate that ELL’s are  progressing according to the language acquisition continuum. Content area tests results also show that ELL’s are mastering the  content. ELLs met the district and their AYP based on EDAT. The freestanding ENL program emphasizes “Academic Rigor” with  high quality ENL teachers and instruction that includes literature and content based learning which is aligned explicitly to NYS  Learning Standards in ENL, ELA and content areas.         4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    P.S. 90 determines groups after analyzing the summative data.  Based on areas of needs that are revealed by data , students  are provided intervention services in reading and math within small group settings.  AIS and ENL teachers work together to  determine students and their needs. Once that is established, teachers provide additional instructional support to address the  targeted needs. Teachers use ENL instructional moves and scaffolding strategies to provide differentiated instruction to ensure  academic success. Teachers monitor progress periodically and take necessary steps based on student progress to ensure  student achievement.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Teachers review student performance data on a regular basis and design units of study to meet the diverse needs of students  while targeting grade-level /course standards. For the upcoming school year we are planning to monitor the progress of  students at least once a month, and use the data to determine whether students still require intervention. For those still  making insufficient progress, school-wide teams will design an intervention plan. Based on student needs, intervention is  provided within Tiers. We will provide training for teachers on how to collect and interpret student data on reading efficiently.  Data-driven decision rules will be developed for providing differentiated instruction to students at varied reading and language  proficiency levels for part of the day.  Peer- assisted learning activities will be planned and organized carefully. Instruction will  address both the social and academic aspects of working with a peer. Activities will focus on simple routines for lower grades,  and vocabulary, reading practice and comprehension skills for the upper grades.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].    NYSESLAT data patterns across the proficiency levels and grades reveal that most of the Entering and Emerging level students  are in the lower grades. The third, fourth and fifth grades have some amount of Entering and Emerging level students. Across  the grades, most students are in the Expanding and Commanding  levels. NYSITELL data indicates that majority of newly  admitted ELLs are in Kindergarten. During NYSITELL assessments more ELLs scored at Expanding proficiency level compared to  Entering level.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53            7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The ENL teachers are strategically placed in teacher teams to collaborate and provide support in ensuring ELL success.  ENL  teachers share NYSITEL and NYSESLAT data with classroom teachers and provide strategies that promote language acquistion.  Generated Data is available to all staff, which includes DRA, NYSITELL ,NYSESLAT,ELA and Math. Teachers across the grade use  the data to form groups and drive instruction.            Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Free Standing ENL program includes Pull-Out, Push-In services as well as first and second grade self-contained ELL  classrooms.   During Pull-Out, ENL teachers work with small group of students to develop English skills for information and  understanding as  well as for literacy response and expression. During Push-In, ENL teachers work with small group of  ELL’s in the classroom using ENL methodologies to facilitate English for critical analysis and evaluation. ELL’s are  placed heterogeneously in their appropriate grades. During Pull-Out, ELL’s are grouped homogeneously based on  their English Proficiency levels. Standalone ENL is implemented during Pull-Out services by a certified ENL teacher  while integrated ENL is implemented during Push-In services by certified ENL teacher with a classroom teacher and/or  content area teacher.      b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A    c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A        2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?          Based on parental selections, P.S. 90 offers Free Standing ENL program.  As part of our identification process we interview  the student and parent to determine home language. Once this is established, students are then identified as potential  ELLs.  When the NYSITELL testing is completed, ENL teachers generate RNMR report to identify eligible students for ENL  services.  All eligible students identified through NYSITELL and NYSESLAT are scheduled based upon their proficiency levels  as  per CR Part 154 guidelines.  Entering and Emerging students receive 360 minutes of ENL instruction.  Transitional and  Expanding students receive 180 minutes .  Commanding students receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL instruction per  week.  During Pull-Out, ENL teachers work with small group of students to develop English skills for information and  understanding as  well as for literacy response and expression with HLA support. During Push-In, ENL teachers work with small  group of ELL’s in the classroom using ENL methodologies to facilitate English for critical analysis and evaluation. Standalone  ENL is implemented during Pull-Out services by a certified ENL teacher while integrated ENL is implemented during Push-In  services by certified ENL teacher with a classroom teacher and/or content area teacher.  In first and second grade ENL  classrooms, standalone and integrated services are provided by certified ENL teachers with HLA support.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.       Freestanding ENL program uses small group instruction for content areas such as Math, Science and Social  Studies.  Language of instruction is English with Native language support. Vocabulary development in content areas is  emphasized. The strategies utilized include cognitive, meta-cognitive and affective strategies by infusing language  development through the content areas in accordance with the scientifically based research by A. Chamot and M. O’Malley.  The Cognitive Academic Language Approach (CALLA) is an instructional model developed to meet the academic needs of ELL’s.  CALLA integrates academic language development, content area instruction and explicit instruction in learning strategies for  both content and language acquisition. This approach makes content comprehensible to enrich language development.  Materials include The Rigby program, Leap frog interactive system and ReadyGen,  newly adopted literacy program by New  York City Department of Education. In addition, ESL teachers differentiate and scaffold content area instruction using non- fiction books, various texts, visuals and technology to make content comprehensible to foster language development and  meet the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards in Self-contained classrooms as well as in Push-In/Pull-out  models.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      Newly identified ELL students whose home language is Spanish take the Spanish LAB to evaluate their native language  proficiency. Results indicate crucial data on the development of the students' first language.  For speakers of other languages ,  there is no State test that evaluates their language proficiency. ENL teachers and other trained staff gather as much  information as possible during the administration of the Home Language Survey interview process in order to understand the  level of first language development. In addition,  Freestanding ENL program at P.S. 90 provides native language support for all  ELLs throughout the year. Native language support includes dictionaries, bilingual glossaries, books in various languages and  technology such as computers.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    ENL teachers differentiate and scaffold content area instruction using non-fiction books, various texts, visuals and technology  to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core Learning  Standards.  a. Plan for SIFE : During ENL instruction, SIFE students are provided with additional background building activities, step by step  guidance and individual support that enables  them to have a frame of reference and eventually to build upon. In addition to  ENL services, SIFE students receive additional academic support from Academic Intervention Service (AIS) teachers.  b. Plan for Newcomers : Newcomers will receive 360 minutes of ENL services a week in a small group. Instruction includes  listening, speaking, reading and writing activities that promote cross cultural knowledge and understanding. All teachers of  newcomers and ENL teachers will create a low anxiety environment to help facilitate language development. These students  are invited to after school programs for language enrichment , academic support and social-emotional development.  c. Plan for Developing : Depending on the results of NYSESLAT, developing ELL students will receive the appropriate allocation  of ENL services. All teachers of developing ELL students and Certified ENL teachers will differentiate and scaffold content  instruction in order to build and enhance the academic knowledge of these students so they could perform grade level work  and comprehend complex texts. Developing ELL students will receive integrated ENL services focusing on the vocabulary  enrichment as well as comprehension strategies.  d. Plan for Long Term : P.S 90 has no Long Term ELL's at this point.  e. Plan for Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status : Starting this year, all former ELLs will receive 90 minutes of  integrated ENL services up to two years after exiting ELL status. This support will enable the former ELLs to transition with  success. All former ELLs will receive extended time and separate location during State tests. These students are invited to  participate in after school program to enrich academic vocabulary and content knowledge.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55         6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Teachers of ELL-SWDs use various grade/age and level appropriate instructional strategies that provide access to academic  content areas and accelerate English language development. ELL’s identified as having special needs are in small group  environment based on their level of instruction specified in ther IEPs. They are provided with individual attention. The  language of instruction is English with Native language support. PS 90 ensures that ELL-SWDs receive all mandated services  mandated on their IEPs. ELL-SWDs whose IEP mandates bilingual instruction receive a bilingual paraprofessional to assist in  daily classroom tasks. ESL teachers promote language development through hands-on activities and the use of visual aides.  ENL teachers differentiate and scaffold content area instruction to make content comprehensible to foster language  development and meet the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards. ENL teachers work in collaboration with special  education teachers, guidance counselor, school administrators and other service providers to  help ELL-SWDs meet their goals.           7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  ELLs with special needs are provided with support in the least restrictive environment according to their IEPs. P.S 90 ensures  that ELL-SWDs spend maximum time with non-disabled peers through flexible programming.This may mean that the students  are mainstreamed for certain content areas and provided with a more restrictive environment depending on the IEP. Common  Core Standards will be incorporated into curriculum maps, grade conferences, and units of study. Writing will be supported by  guided writing, and daily writer's journals. Teachers will continue to use Guided Reading daily in the classrooms. Level 1 ( State  Tests) students will receive AIS small group instruction for a minimum of 3 times per week. Level 2 students will be the target  group after school programs. Level 3 and 4 students will participate in enrichment opportunities during and after school.  Individual student goals will be created and utilized when planning lessons and delivering instruction so that all needs will be  met. ELL-SWDs will be invited to participate in after-school program. This program will focus on Language development and  ELA comprehension strategies. It will also increase time on task for individual and differentiated instruction. Assessment  folders ( classroom teachers, AIS/SETTS providers) will reflect individualized student goals in ELA and benchmark targets. These  goals will be updated to reflect successes and areas of concern after each unit of study.  P.S. 90 Q has an eager staff ready to service our ELL population. It is our belief that our students' success will be imminent  when instruction is scaffolded based upon experiences that each student possesses.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.   The targeted intervention services for ELLs is determined based on the students' scores on ELA, Math, NYSESLAT assessments  as well as the performance in class and  teacher evaluation. ELLs who scored below grade level in State tests receive AIS  services in Reading and Math. Teachers provide differentiated instruction with ENL scaffolding and strategies to support the  needs of the targeted group of students. In addition, students are invited to attend after school programs for additional  opportunities for learning. New-comers will be targeted for intervention for ELA because the State tests present a challenge  and they are expected to take the test after a year of schooling in U.S. With the shift to Common Core Standards, our ELLs are  faced with reading more challenging texts and understanding academic vocabulary. This group receives scaffolded instruction  to provide language support. ELLs receiving service 4 to 6 years will receive additional support through AIS services and  after  school programs. Teachers provide targeted instruction to support the needs in small settings. New-comers and targeted ELLs  will receive support in Reading, Math , Science and Language Development. All ELLs will be strongly encouraged to attend after  school programs to enhance their language skills and academic vocabulary. Language used for instruction in all our  intervention services is English with home language support.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?       We will utilize the existing programs for instruction for the upcoming school year. In addition to The Rigby series and two  programs ReadyGen and GoMath will be tailored to meet the needs of our ELL students. These programs are being  implemented in New York City Public Schools.These programs will be utilized for instruction in order to meet the needs of ELLs   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      in language development as well as meeting the Common Core State Standards. ENL teachers will differentiate and scaffold  instruction to make it more accessible and meaningful for ELL students.        10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   No program/services for ELLs will be discontinued this year.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs. The ELLs are invited to participate in after school program. After school  program offers targeted instruction to support the ELLs in the program. Teachers provide targeted Reading and Math  instruction to support student learning.In addition, Title III offers after school specifically designed to meet the needs of  ELLs.  All ELLs are encouraged to participate in the program. The program focuses on language development, academic  vocabulary and computer skills as well as meeting the Common Core Standards.   Teachers scaffold instruction to support and  engage ELLs in the program. Lastly, Title III immigrant program offers homework support with the help of a bilingual teacher  and three paraproffesionals. This program supports  student learning and provides parents with language needs.          12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  The four certified ESL teachers use a wide range of materials that include books and audio tapes to support fluency and  comprehension. Rigby’s On Our Way to English program offers reading and writing instruction specially tailored to the needs of  ELL’s. The program is based on effective research and provides comprehensive literacy instruction as well as standard based  content area information. In addition, ESL teachers use high interest non-fiction books to support Science and Math  instructions. Manipulative are used for hands on activities to enforce learning. ELL students are provided with native language  textbooks in Math, Science and Social Studies as well as dictionaries. Moreover, ESL program provides a variety of fiction titles  so children can practice reading different genres. Large colorful charts are used to highlight different strategies and skills  children need to be good readers. ESL instructions also include the Leap Frog program. Leap Frog promotes language  development through interaction. Also, ELL students are strategically placed in classrooms with technology such as computers  and Smart boards. This technology is incorporated that  ELLs receive more support in instruction. These instructional programs  and activities are implemented to ensure that ELLs meet and exceed the standards. In addition to The Rigby series,  Two  programs are implemented at PS 90 this year: ReadyGen and GoMath. These programs will be utilized for instruction in order  to meet the needs of ELLs in language development as well as in meeting the Common Core State Standards.         13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   P.S. 90 has only freestanding ESL program. All instruction is in English yet; Newcomers may receive some support in their  native language. For content areas such as Math, Science and Social Studies, they receive grade appropriate text and work  books in the native language. In addition, ELL’s are provided with the content area test in their native language. If the test is  not available in the native language, translation is provided for content area tests. During test, ELL’s are allowed to use  bilingual dictionaries.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All required services support and all resources correspond to ELLs' ages and grade levels.  Classroom teachers, AIS teachers and  ENL teachers utilize age and grade appropriate materials and resources to make content comprehensible to foster language  development. Based on the subgroup and state test results, ELLs are engaged in instruction accordingly. Teachers implement  scaffolding support and ENL instructional strategies to ensure that ELLs are engaged in instruction. Based on the first blue print  principles for ELLs, we share the belief that all teachers are teachers of ELLs.  ENL teachers engage the school community via  Professional Development to build capacity and to ensure all teachers plan and provide age, grade and level appropriate  instruction for ELLs. School leaders and ENL teachers attend teacher team meetings to participate in planning and ensuring  resources are age and grade appropriate.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57         The four certified ESL teachers use a wide range of materials that include books and audio tapes to support fluency and  comprehension. Rigby’s On Our Way to English program offers reading and writing instruction specially tailored to the needs of  ELL’s. The program is based on effective research and provides comprehensive literacy instruction as well as standard based  content area information. In addition, ESL teachers use high interest non-fiction books to support Science and Math  instructions. Manipulative are used for hands on activities to enforce learning. ELL students are provided with native language  textbooks in Math, Science and Social Studies as well as dictionaries. Moreover, ESL program provides a variety of fiction titles  so children can practice reading different genres. Large colorful charts are used to highlight different strategies and skills  children need to be good readers. ESL instructions also include the Leap Frog program. Leap Frog promotes language  development through interaction. Also, ELL students are strategically placed in classrooms with technolgy such as computers  and Smartboards. This thechnology is incorporated that  ELLs receive more support in instruction. These instructional  programs and activities are implemented to ensure that ELLs meet and exceed the standards. In addition to The Rigby  series,  Two programs are implemented at PS 90 this year: ReadyGen and GoMath. These programs will be utilized for  instruction in order to meet the needs of ELLs in language development as well as in meeting the Common Core State  Standards.         16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).    At this time P.S 90 does not have any programs or activities to assist newly enrolled ELL’s before the beginning of the school  year.        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    At this time P.S 90 does not offer electives to ELLs.       18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  All ENL teachers at P.S. 90 are actively involved in professional development. They attend monthly meetings to keep up with  the necessary administrative paperwork as well as the current research-based ELL instruction.  Each ENL teacher attends the  common prep grade meetings for planning and assisting with the challenges ELLs face. They also meet on Mondays with their  teacher teams as part of their professional development to discuss student work and offer suggestions of strategies that help  foster Our ELL' 'language development and academic success.        ENL teachers receive support through professional development that is provided by the school district. Then, ENL teachers  share the information gained via these professional development with school staff. ENL teachers provide assistance through  Professional development and Collaborative planning. Professional development sessions are designed to support monolingual  staff members in delivering instruction to our ELL students. As part of Professional development, Guidance Counselor receive  assistance in terms placing ELL students based on their English Proficiency levels and Home Languages. ENL teachers  coordinate instruction with mainstream teachers throughout the year.  These Professional Development sessions support  teachers in delivering Common Core-aligned instruction that is reading more complex texts and understanding academic   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         vocabulary. ENL teachers took part in a series of citywide workshops in supporting ELLs as they engage in the Common Core  Learning Standards. They turnkey valuable information and effective strategies with the school community. Our ENL team is  available for responding to teachers’ concerns regarding ELL students during professional sessions.       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.   As part of Professional Development, Guidance Counselor receives assistance in terms of placing ELL students based on their  English Proficiency levels and Home languages. ENL teachers work very closely with the school staff and guidance counselor to  assist our ELLs as they transition to middle school. ENL teachers provide guidance in completing necessary documentation in  student cumulative folders and make sure ELLs are placed according to their needs.     ELL teachers will provide professional development sessions in order to meet the requirement of 15% of total hours for all  teachers. We will utilize the time on Mondays to provide training to all staff sharing best practices and providing guidance as  well as helpful strategies to help all teacher meet the needs of ELL students. All ELL teachers will form a study group to  enhance their performance and share best practices across the grades in order to meet the requirement of 50% of total  provisional development hours.            Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Our ELL teachers will provide additional annual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas.  ELL teachers will  send notices and make phone calls in order to ensure the attendance of the parents of ELL students. ELL teachers will keep a  record of the meeting on file. Our ELL teachers will make a qualified translator available or utilize the translation unit over the  phone to ensure the parents understand the content of the meeting. Lastly, parents will be provided with translated materials  in their home language.     2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Parent involvement is an important part of the ENL program. In September, P.S. 90 holds an annual Parent Orientation  meeting where the ELL parents are invited. . During the meeting parents watch a video that explains the three programs in  English as well as in various home languages in great detail. Other ENL teachers as well as paraprofessionals are available for  assistance in translation. Parents are encouraged to ask questions regarding the program selection and their child’s education.  The parents are invited again on Tuesdays to come in and become more familiar with our ENL program and discuss the  progress of their child. They are able to look through various materials that the certified ENL teachers use in order to meet the  instructional needs of the ELL’s. In addition, parents are involved in publishing celebrations, cultural activates and award  ceremonies. Our PTA is also actively involved in engaging all parents including ELL parents in their activities. Parents are  encouraged to take part in Parent Workshops, ENL classes provided by our Parent Coordinator, Lydia Perez and Thanksgiving  celebrations by bringing in a dish from their culture. Translation is provided via qualified translators and/or the translation unit  over the phone.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.

ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   P.S.90                                                                              School DBN: 27Q090  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      P.S. 90 uses information collected from the Home Language Surveys, as well as information collected at School  Leadership meetings and during PTA meetings to assess our school's written and oral interpretation needs. In  addition, we use the results of our Learning Environment survey to help meet the needs of the parents. From our  home language surveys during the registration process, we learned that there are over 562 families that speak  English and an additional 193 families that speak Spanish at home. The next two largest home language  populations were Punjabi with 23 families and Bengali with 11 families. The Parent Coordinator at P.S. 90, as well  as many other staff members are fluent in Spanish. During Parent Teacher conferences these staff members  provide translation services to the parents that need or request this service. Also, one of our paraprofessionals on  the staff is fluent in Punjabi/Hindi and helps translate during parent workshops and Parent Teacher conferences.  Our school community is made aware of the available written and oral translation services via written notices.  There are posters indicating the available translation services in our main office and on the Parent bulletin board  on the first floor adjacent to the information desk. Moreover, school information, letters and notes are sent home  in English and Spanish, due to the fact that approximately 50% of our students have parents who speak Spanish at   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63      home. Letters are translated also into Punjabi and Bengali for families who speak these languages at home as  well. We also use Google Translator to translate any other language as needed. Additionally, we utilize over the  phone translation services. Parents and visitors are provided with visual graphics matched to the available  languages to help them identify their language to so they could receive the translation and interpretation in order  to meet the needs of the parents in our school.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community.

Our  school uses  parent  volunteers,  bilingual staff  members and  over the phone  translation  services to  ensure parents'  language needs  are  accommodated.            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66     3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      P.S. 90 uses a company called Blackboard that sends school related messages to families. Messages are automatically  translated into the preferred languages as indicated in ATS. In the event of a school emergency, parents are being  communicated via English and phone blasts are done based on the preferred languages of individual families. Parents  also receive written communications regarding emergencies in their preferred languages.            Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      At P.S 90 the home languages of students and the parent's preferred languages are identified during the registration  process. Parents are encouraged to indicate their home language in order to receive important documents translated  in a timely manner. All communications from school such as notices and letters will be translated into the home  language based on the preferred languages indicated during the registration process. P.S. 90 will provide parents with  translated documents pertaining to their child's safety,health, progress report, report cards and legal or disciplinary  matters. We have posted signs in and around the building notifying parents and staff of the translation service and the  available languages. Staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor's Regulation A-663 and the resources available  to them. Our primary language access coordinator Lydia Perez, and ENL teachers ensure that any language assistance  needed is provided. This is strongly communicated during PD's and teacher teams. We use the translation unit,  Blackboard Company, and bilingual staff members to ensure the language support is provided. Staff members in need  of language support is directed to contact the language access coordinator or any available ENL teacher. This protocol  is put in place and all staff members are notified at the beginning of the year.          Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      Parents will indicate at the beginning of the school year what language is spoken at home as well as the preferred  language of written and or oral communications. According to Section VII of Chancellor's Regulations A-663 schools  are required to determine the student's home language within 30 days of enrollment. At P.S 90 the home languages  of students and the parent's preferred languages are identified during the registration process. Parents are  encouraged to indicate their home language in order to receive important documents translated in a timely manner.  All communications from school such as notices and letters will be translated into the home language based on the  preferred languages indicated during the registration process. P.S. 90 will provide parents with translated documents  pertaining to their child's safety,health, progress report, report cards and legal or disciplinary matters.
