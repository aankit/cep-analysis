This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   We at P.S. 207 are dedicated to creating an environment, which is conducive to learning while meeting the academic,  social, and emotional needs of our diverse student population. We will help our students become college and career  ready by holding them to high expectations. We are providing them with rigorous instruction aligned with Common  Core Learning Standards. We encourage student creativity and individuality while helping our students to develop  solid values that foster respect for self and others.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Elizabeth G. Leary is an elementary/middle school (K-8) with 1283 students from Grade Pre-kindergarten through  Grade 8. The school comprises of two buildings; the main campus on Fillmore Avenue holds 856 students in Grades 2- 8 and The Early Childhood Center has 327 students in Grades Pre-K-1 and two second grade classes. The school  population comprises 9.28% Asian, 34.84% Black, 15.35% Hispanic, and 37.65% White students. The number of special  education students is 217 or 17% of our student population. The number of English Language Learners is 41 students  or 3.2%. 38.4% of our students are entitled to Free Lunch. Boys account for 52.07% of the students enrolled and girls  account for 47.93%. The average attendance rate for the school year 2016-2017 was 95.6%.       Our diverse population of students has varied needs. We meet these needs academically through differentiated small  group instruction based on data. Instruction is modified and scaffolded when needed. We try to meet the social and  emotional needs of our students through responsive classroom and restorative circles.      The school adheres to a culture of learning that maintains high expectations and rigorous curricula across the grades  to promote college and career readiness for all students. Teacher pedagogy is based upon Common Core Learning  Standards and the Danielson Framework for Teaching which is aligned to lessons, units and curricula planning.  Teachers use high level questioning techniques in order to foster critical thinking and student participation.  Accountable talk and discourse theory is used in every classroom. Research based techniques are used in English  Language Arts and Mathematics. Computer technology is utilized in every classroom. At the Early Childhood Center  we have Promethean Boards and at the main campus we use SMART Boards. All students have access to iPads and  laptops which are used to take notes and research content areas.   2018 New York State Spring Results showed 59.% of students in Grades 3-8 are proficient in Levels 3&4 in English  Language Arts (ELA) (a 5% increase from last year) and 53.% are proficient in Levels 3&4 in Mathematics. The Data  Team analyzed the scores of the lowest third of our students in math and literacy. Using assessment results during the  course of the year and item analysis, grouping and instruction are formed.   Formative and Summative Assessments are used on an ongoing basis to analyze information on student learning.   The Teaching and Learning Cycle (Assess, Evaluate, Plan, and Teach) is at the center of our vision for school  improvement. Teachers routinely use assessment data to inform instruction, look at relevant data trends in order to  accelerate student performance. We analyze formative and summative data on a daily, weekly and monthly basis.  This analysis helps to inform our instruction particularly in regards to grouping and differentiation.      We offer Common Core Regents courses in Living Environment and Common Core Algebra to eligible eighth grade  students .Our 7th and 8th grade students participated in a weekly enrichment class. The Fillmore Academy (grades 6- 8) has a drama club in collaboration with the after school Millennium program. Performances included evening,  weekend and after school productions enabling families to participate in their children’s milestones.       We have a Chess program for our elementary and middle school students which culminates in an end of year school- wide Chess Tournament. Our middle school students participate in basketball games, volleyball games and flag  football games with neighboring schools through the Millennium program. This gives our students an opportunity to  meet other children from different schools.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10         We collaborate with the Millennium After-School Program. In addition, we partner with student teachers from St.  Josephs College, Brooklyn College and Touro Graduate School of Education and Psychology. Student teachers work  with lower and upper grades as well as general and special education students.       This past year, we collaborated with PS 206, and created a Mock Trial team. On two different occasions the two teams  tried their cases at the Madison High School Court Room. Students received feedback to help them improve their  delivery when presenting cases. Fifth grade students participated in three debates with our cohort schools. This  program allowed our students to create viable arguments as well as acknowledge counterclaims.      We have a dedicated PTA that consists of devoted parents. The PTA has contributed funds for the entire school  community to have access to Brain Pop, RAZ for Kids, the chess program, the music and art programs as well as an  after school program for struggling readers. They have a PTA page on Facebook to keep parents up to date on school  activities. Our parent coordinator provides monthly calendars, a school website with updated information and parent  events, email blasts, updates the Facebook and Instagram and is a liaison between school personnel and parents.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Students with disabilities, English Language Learners, Economically Disadvantaged    SWDs - We are noticing that our SWDs are very low in basic literacy and mathematical skills which also effects their  self-esteem.   ELLs - We are noticing that they are weak in vocabulary acquisition and social skills such as verbalizing their needs,  participation in discussions. etc   Economically Disadvantages - We are noticing the same needs and challenges as mentioned with the SWDs and ELLs.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which we made the most progress over the past year were  Family Community Ties and Trust. We provided workshops in grades 3-5 in mathematics during the parent  engagement period on Tuesdays as well as workshops on social and emotional wellness during the school day.  Families were invited to various events in all grades throughout the year before, during and after school.   In Effective School Leadership, we had 20% of our staff members present professional development throughout the  school year (Kahoots!, Fundations, Responsive Circles, Clickers, math workshops)      Our key areas of focus for 2018-2019 school year are promoting collaborative teachers to share best practices to build  teaching capacity and to help build coherence across all grade levels. Additionally, the administrative team will be  working to create coherence amongst the team to ensure there is a system of high quality observation and feedback  to teachers that clearly articulates next steps for individual development and support.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11              2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 22K207   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05,06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   1228   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     A comprehensive assessment of our academic program was completed using the information from the School Quality  Snapshot, Framework for Great Schools Report, school based assessments, PPO feedback, Measures of Student  Learning (MOSL) and Measures of Teacher Performance (MOTP) data via classroom observations and NYS Math test  results under the Common Core Learning Standards. The data, found on the School Quality Guide for 2017-2018  shows that student progress is approaching the target in Mathematics. Additionally, all adult school constituents  (teachers, paras and SLT) engaged in a reflection protocol using the elements of the Framework for Great Schools to  identify areas of strength and areas in need of improvement for the 18-19 school year.   Last year, we worked collaboratively with a coach from Algebra For All and together, with administration, we realized  that there was a deficit in written and verbal explanations. We need to focus on supporting our student needs in  order to open math potential and enhance students' mathematics conceptual development, understanding and  explanation of their thinking and reasoning, both independently and collaboratively, by building teacher capacity in  the following pedagogical principle: Students will participate in writing to learn and communicate mathematics to  enhance their conceptual development, understanding and explanation of their thinking and reasoning. This goal will  remain as we expand our work through additional grade bands.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   By June 2019, 80% of students will participate in the use of math journals (continuing with previous years and  implementing with grades 3, 6, and 8th), will show progress in formulating an extended response by providing an  explanation demonstrating their knowledge of mathematical concepts through written expression. The instruments  that will be used to track progress will be the initial needs assessment, MoSL (BOY, MOY, EOY), midterms and final  exams as well as portfolio work that will be collected and reviewed by administration 3 times throughout the year.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional  development, and/or systems and structures needed  to impact change.

NA        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 207 is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association and as trained volunteers and are welcomed members of the school community.      P.S. 207 will support parents and families of our students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school surveys and  feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and enhance the  school's program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Parent Involvement Policy, parent members of the school’s Parent-Teacher Association as well as  parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Parent Involvement Policy and  asked to survey their members for additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality,  the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s  programs as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s  Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ●  support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Teacher Association. This includes providing technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in  developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38            The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Teacher Association   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.         School-Parent Compact (SPC) Template   School-Parent Compact (SPC)      P.S. 207 , is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student  achievement between the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and  programs agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility  for improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure  that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

Our program will provide our  ELLs the opportunity to expand their language and processing skills.  The program is designed to  motivate and promote the development of our English Language Learners.  There are currently  56 ELL students in grades K through 8.  Parents are notified of the programs in their preferred  language.  The students are invited to participate in a variety of courses that help them continue  to develop their English language skills in the areas of reading, writing, speaking and  listening.  The program also provides ELL students with the opportunity to participate in  enrichment programs that they might not have access to.  There is a total of 8 licensed teachers  working with groups of 6-10 students.  Courses were determined based on the  NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, state exams, and Fountas and Pinnell results. The areas of weakness  noted are reading and writing. Course themes are writers workshop, theater, book clubs, kitchen  chemistry, and debate.  Based on Title III funding, the courses will begin on January 8, 2019 and  conclude on April 6, 2019.  The sessions will meet once a week for twelve weeks. Three courses  will take place on Wednesday afternoon and three courses will take place on Thursday afternoon.  Students will receive a tear-off explaining the courses being offered.  They can then choose  either one or two classes they'd like to participate in.  If they choose two, the courses must be on  different days. The ENL teachers will then use the returned tear-offs to place them in a course of  their choice. Students will be placed in one of their choices.  The students can sign up for more  than one class if they are willing to come on both days the classes are offered. A daily sign in  attendance sheet will be maintained for each course on the day its given. Supplemental materials  for each course will be purchased using allocated Title III funds. Both Wednesday and Thursday  afternoon courses will be from 2:45 - 3:45 with a minimum of 6 students in each program.  The  first Wednesday afternoon program is a "Book Club".  The teacher is Mrs. Ingber.  She holds a  NYC license in special education and presently co-teaches a second grade ICT class.  The  students will read "Twister on Tuesday" from the Magic Treehouse series.  She will extend the  topic by incorporating science lessons on tornadoes and a hands-on activity in which they  construct their own tornado. She will use graphic organizers and strategy checklists to enhance  the students' comprehension skills.  She will use her expertise in devising and implementing  modifications and accommodations, as well as utilize reading strategies and enrichment  techniques.  She will also incorporate instructional resources for developing test-taking strategies  and skills.  The second Wednesday afternoon program is also a "Book Club" which will be  facilitated by Ms. Giannini who holds a NYC special education  license and presently teaches the  fifth grade "Enrichment" class.    Ms. Giannini will be using the Newberry Medal book "Shiloh"  with her students. She will use audio in conjunction with the book in order to improve students  listening skills, build fluency, and hear proper pronunciation of academic vocabulary.  She will  also show the film in order to help the students visualize the text.  Then, they will  compare and  contrast the text with the film using a venn diagram and other graphic organizers such as the  Frayer Model.  The students culminating activity will be to write a persuasive essay on their  preference for either the text or the movie.  The third Wednesday afternoon  program is a Science  Enrichment program.  This program will be administered by Ms. Ricciardi who is a licensed   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   NYC teacher currently teaching science.  She will teach a course called "Kitchen  Chemistry".  Young scientists can explore the world of chemistry in a safe and fun way.  Using  common household substances, they will create items such as rock candy and modeling  clay.  Students will explore the science behind food and everyday household products. The ENL  teacher will push into each Wednesday afternoon programs and co-teach for 20 minutes to  support the ELL students.  The Wednesday afternoon programs will have a total of 4 teachers x  12hours x $50.13 per hour for a total of $2,406.24. Three courses will take place on Thursday.  The first Thursday program will be "Debate".  The teacher is Ms. Frange, and she is a licensed  NYC special education teacher who is currently co-teaching in a second grade ICT  class.  Students will participate in a debate class that will build upon discussion skills and  academic vocabulary using scaffolds for support.  They will utilize technology such as IPADs  and/or laptops to research current event articles. Using Cornell Note-taking technique they will  develop an argument based on their research.  The second Thursday afternoon program is called  "Theater Workshop".  It will be moderated by Mrs. Gianfagna. She holds a NYC special  education license and currently teaches a kindergarten class.  Students will learn basic acting  skills that introduce them to focusing and getting in touch with characters.  A mini performance  will be the culminating activity. The third Thursday program is called "The Writer's Corner".  It  will be conducted by Dr. Getman who possesses a doctorate in education (specializing in  reading).  She will focus on the writing process to strengthen their writing skills. Students will  start with a summarizing paragraph and then writing that leads to a three paragraph essay.  In  addition students will use an appropriate rubric based on their grade and the common core  learning standards to assess their writing. Dr. Getman will also incorporate peer editing in the  process. The ENL teacher will push-into each Thursday afternoon program and co-teach for 20  minutes to support the ELL students.  The Thursday afternoon programs will have a total of 4  teachers x 12hours x $50.13 per hour for a total of $2,406.24.  A portion of the time in each  course is focused on NYSESLAT preparation, and instructors review reading, writing speaking  and listening strategies in the context of the course.   Students are able to use their English, while  at the same time learning a new skill, discover a talent, or begin a life-long passion for something  they love.  Coursework is geared for ELLs to promote participation, motivation, and self- confidence.  Students are grouped by grade or contiguous grades.  The students receive their own  copies of materials to keep and continue to use beyond the course.  They also receive  instructional materials (art kits, copies of book club novels),  as well as NYSESLAT review  books.  The cost of the NYSESLAT materials is $1869.60.  Students will also have the  opportunity to use Imagine Learning and ESLreadingSmart in the context of the course.  The  cost for 27 Imagine Learning licenses will be $5,250 and the cost for 11 - 25 students in ESL  ReadingSmart is $684.00.  Our technology programs are tailored to meet the  students'  individual needs.  The programs include reading, writing, speaking, and listening activities that  teach skills that will help prepare them for the NYSESLAT and state tests.  The ENL teacher will  present an orientation and provide training for all teachers in ENL methodologies.  She will also  use the push-in model.  Content area teachers must also demonstrate expertise in their specific  course of study (i.e.  Science, English Language Arts, Fine Arts and Technology).

Workshop  topics include literacy based strategies for ELL's, addressing the needs of students with  disabilities who are also ELL's, and content area instructional techniques addressing the needs of  all ELL's.  In addition, professional development is also delivered during our November and June  professional days with a focus on the data analysis and curriculum design. Teachers also engage  in multicultural awareness training to be more accomodating to our ELL families and better  assist them in their child's educational progress.  All teachers who are direct instructors for the ExcELL Enrichment Program receive a specific  training on how to implement ELL methodologies into the content area presentation of the  course. All instructors must complete an orientation and training from the ENL teacher who  coordinates the program prior to the start of the course. There will be one professional learning  session for 6 teachers of the program conducted by the two ENL teachers . The professional  development session will be one hour.  It  will take place on Monday, December 17th during  professional development .

Data suggests a strong link  between parent involvement and student progress.  We provide a number of opportunities to  engage parents in their child's learning process. We understand that it is difficult for parents to  navigate the learning process with their child, especially if English is not spoken.   The ENL  teacher serves as the liaison with ELL families, and ensures, with the assistance of the Parent  Coordinator, that ELL families receive communications from the school in a timely manner, and  in their preferred language. Translation and interpretation assistance is provided for all ELL  family events and parents are notified with a personal invitation for all upcoming events.  In  addition to the mandated orientations, the ENL teachers and parent coordinator will host  information sessions to offer parents an opportunity to speak about their child's academic   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46         Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    progress and to provide suggestions and assistance to parents as they help their child learn. The  first information session will take place on "Back to School Night" (September 22nd). ENL  teachers will review NYSESLAT results with the parents to inform them of their child's  strengths and weaknesses. Suggestions will also be discussed on how to improve areas of  weakness. Based on the Back to School Night conferences the following parent workshops will  be given to support our ELL parents.  The first workshop entitled  "Helping Your Child Learn to  Read in English", will take place on Tuesday, October30th from 2:40- 3:25 during parent  engagement. The second workshop entitled, "Preparing for the NYSESLAT and State Exams"  will take place on Tuesday, January 15th from 2:40-3:25 during parent engagement. The third  workshop entitled  "Family Learning Activities" will take place on Tuesday, May 7th from 2:40- 3:25 during parent engagement. ENL teachers will conduct a workshop on the ESL Reading  Smart program to assist parents in the acquisition of the English language. Invitations in parents  preferred languages will be sent out prior to the sessions.  An agenda(translated if needed) will  be distributed at the start of each information session.                       Part E: Budget   FOR SCHOOLS NOT CONCEPTUALLY CONSOLIDATED ONLY.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?     The goal of the ENL Program is to foster the development of the modalities of listening, speaking, reading and writing so that  the students move toward fluency and proficiency in English.  Improvement of academic language is at the cornerstone of the  curriculum, in order for ELLs to achieve success in their entire educational career and beyond.     Data analysis and review is an ongoing process for all levels of the school.  In order to assess early literacy skills, the team  administers Fountas and Pinnell and Gates MacGinitie assessments.  This data is an integral part of the planning process for  ELL curriculum in the early grades.  On the whole, the majority of ELLs in the early grades tend to score lower on these  assessments based upon their lack of exposure and in many cases pre-school preparation deficits.  Early intervention  techniques with these children definitely provide quicker recovery, and in turn ELLs can easily maintain grade level  performance.  Analysis of data for early childhood ELLs reveals that these students on the whole need reinforcement of basic   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      early literacy skills from lack of exposure to English at an early age, and for some a lack of Pre-Kindergarten school  experience.  This includes socialization skills and adaptation to school behaviors in general.        2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   To support these efforts, we use cohesive planning. For example, on the 2nd grade we meet with the classroom  teacher/teachers to choose appropriate materials and scaffolds that support content learning through the Journeys program  for all ELLs.  Supports vary depending on the English proficiency level of each student. Assessments are modified based on the  proficiency level of the students.  We also meet with the teachers to discuss formative assessment results that help drive  instruction.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?     Evaluation of ELL program success is ongoing throughout the school year.  Beginning with the analysis of     NYSESLAT data  from the prior spring, the ENL teacher compares data from the prior year's NYSESLAT scores  to the current score. Each modality is analyzed and the modality with least progress becomes the focus for the school  year.  This data serves as the overall progress and performance indicator for the end of the  prior year.  Then, students are monitored through benchmark assessments such as Fountas & Pinnell in the beginning, middle  and end of the school year or Gates MacGinitie is also administered in the beginning and end of the year to assess vocabulary  and comprehension skills.  The data is analyzed in order to identify areas of weakness for groups of students or individual  students.           4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Interventions are addressed in daily lessons through comprehensible input, cooperative learning groups, visual supports such  as graphic organizers, maps, and charts. Key vocabulary is explicitly taught and background knowledge is activated. We  examine cognates.  ELLs are provided with explicit and intensive instruction in phonological awareness and phonics in order to  build decoding skills.  Students participate in read alouds and corrective feedback is provided.  Lessons incorporate discussion  and questioning.  They are increasingly exposed to print. Students are engaged and motivated through active participation,  visuals, audio, and technology. Trained ENL implement the SIOP model.  In addition, they have provided workshops  demonstrating the use of SIOP strategies.       5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]      After universal screening, teachers of ELL students work in collaboration with the ENL teacher to provide strong Tier 1  instruction.  Struggling ELL's are brought up in the PPT meeting and the names are given to the RTI coordinator.  The RTI  provider along with the ENL teacher make decisions and analyze documentation on how instruction was differentiated to  address native and second language concerns and cultural differences, the amount and type of ENL instruction, an  understanding of whether or not native language support was used, and a description of the amount and type of native  language instruction.  In addition, they identify instructional areas (specific skills and competencies) that need further, more  intense intervention, and the extent, if any, to which ESL instruction and/or native language instruction is needed during Tiers  2 and 3 interventions to ensure the student will benefit from the intervention.  Every 6-8 weeks, students are monitored and  the data will reveal if additional time is needed, or if the child needs to be brought to Tier 3.  The support services provided  must be aligned to any intervention plans the school is already providing to all students.  There are RTI resources for ELL  educators on the DELLSS website that we utilize to support intervention instruction.            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51         6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].      Based on  2016-2017 NYSESLAT results, we are finding that our recent influx of entering ELLs are in need of basic listening,  speaking, reading and writing skills. Currently many entering ELLs have minimal to no English language exposure prior to the  start of school. This indicates a need for basic conversational skills on top of strong support in academic language instruction,  and continued, rigorous curriculum that reflects sound reading and writing strategies.  Analysis of ELL student results on  standardized ELA and Math tests reveal that students perform better in Math than in other English language dominant  tests.  However, the data from the NYSESLAT also shows ELLs making progress in English language proficiency.        7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   ENL teachers incorporate both push-in and pull-out model.  Various modifications which include and are not limited to graphic  organizers, pictures, vocabulary, maps, diagrams, dictionaries, thesauruses, translated text where applicable, and academic  vocabulary glossaries. To disseminate these structures and our findings we organize monthly grade meetings, professional  development workshops, and periodic conferences with teachers of struggling ELLS to share findings and discuss strategies  to  rectify any challenges that arise within the program structure. Collaboration takes place at these meetings. Unit plans and  individual lesson plans are revised to better meet the needs of our ELLs.  Additional modifications are determined and a plan of  execution is established.            Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.      The Language Allocation Policy for P.S. 207 is 100% instruction in English since it is a Freestanding ENL  Program.  Students at the Beginner/Entering level are entitled to a total of 360 minutes with the minimum   number of 180 minutes in standalone ENL and 180 minutes in integrated ENL.  At the Low   Intermediate/Emerging level, the students receive a total of 360 minutes with the minimum of 90 minutes   in standalone ENL and 180 minutes in integrated ENL.  The additional 90 minutes can be standalone or   integrated with ELA or any other content area.  The intermediate/Transitioning Level receives a total of 180   minutes with a minimum of 90 minutes integrated ENL and an additional 90 minutes in either standalone or   integrated with ELA or any other content area.  The Advanced/Expanding level receives a total of 180   minutes of integrated ENL.  The Proficient/Commanding level receives a total of 90 minutes of integrated   ENL.  The ENL teacher uses a combination of pull-out, push-in, and collaborative organization models for   instruction, and students are grouped homogeneously.  The maximum allowable grade span for grouping   instruction in grades K-12 English as a New Language is 2 contiguous grades.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.      At the present time our school does not have a Transitional Bilingual Education program.  If a parents prefers a  TBE program they are directed to our parent coordinator Donna Pimpanella for further assistance in locating a school  that  offers the program.     c.  DL program.  If applicable.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52         At the present time our school does not have a Dual Language program.  If a parents prefers a Dual Language program  they are directed to our parent coordinator Donna Pimpinella for further assistance in locating a school that  offers  the program.     2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              According to the NYS CR Part 154 guidelines, the ENL teacher is able to provide for the mandated number of units of  instruction in her schedule using contiguous groupings.  All students receive the mandated units of instruction.   Students at  the Beginner/Entering level are entitled to a total of 360 minutes with the minimum   number of 180 minutes in standalone ENL and 180 minutes in integrated ENL.  At the Low   Intermediate/Emerging level, the students receive a total of 360 minutes with the minimum of 90 minutes   in standalone ENL and 180 minutes in integrated ENL.  The additional 90 minutes can be standalone or   integrated with ELA or any other content area.  The intermediate/Transitioning Level receives a total of 180   minutes with a minimum of 90 minutes integrated ENL and an additional 90 minutes in either standalone or   integrated with ELA or any other content area.  The Advanced/Expanding level receives a total of 180   minutes of integrated ENL.  The Proficient/Commanding level receives a total of 90 minutes of integrated   ENL.  The ENL teacher uses a combination of pull-out, push-in, and collaborative organization models for   instruction, and students are grouped homogeneously.   As per policy guidelines, native language support is provided via  glossaries, translator/interpreter services, student buddies, and other bi-lingual resources including bilingual libraries.                  3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   ELLs receive instruction in the content areas in English with native language supports such as glossaries and bilingual  resources. The ELL content area curriculum is aligned with the grade level curriculum as well as the common core standards to  reinforce and enhance subject matter for ELLs.  Heavy emphasis is placed on vocabulary acquisition in the content area, as well  as content area based writing.  This interdisciplinary approach is intertwined with the four modalities of reading, writing,  listening, and speaking.  Wherever possible, the ENL teacher works collaboratively with the content area teachers.  Students  are able to bring content area assignments and project work to the ELL class regularly, where the ENL teacher provides  support, guidance, and access to technology for word processing and research materials.         4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      Each year, every student in the ELL program is evaluated based upon several criteria including, but not limited to NYSESLAT  scores, State ELA and Math scores, guided reading levels, progress reports, and anecdotals and conferencing reports from the  classroom teacher and ENL teacher alike.  Each student is treated as an individual case, where progress is not only evaluated  from the latest testing, but is examined longitudinally to create a better learning plan for long term ELLs and ELLs who stall at a  certain level.  Where necessary, based upon level of English proficiency, ELLs are also evaluated using translated tests and  bilingual staff to interpret questions.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         ELL instruction is carefully planned and differentiated to suit the needs of all ELLs and their learning  needs.   Newcomers and SIFE students are under constant evaluation, as their initial transition can be  very difficult.  The ENL teacher collaborates with the classroom teacher, and provides an "open-door"  policy for these students who may come to the ENL room for extra support and learning aids throughout  the day.  Additional support is given through the use of laptop computers and audio books to offer  continued literacy exposure.  For mid-range (4-5 years) and long-term (6+ years) ELLs, the strategy  changes slightly to include remedial support in all skill areas, as well as study skills, homework  management, and general academic advisement.  With these students, an in depth analysis and  consultation of NYSESLAT scores is an integral part of their progress.  Most students who stall out and  are in the long term ELL range, need more assistance with reading comprehension skills and writing in  response to reading.  This is a heavy focus in the curriculum for these students.     In addition to ENL instruction, students in all sub groups who are evaluated as needing more support are  placed in small group ELA intervention.   SIFE (Students with Interrupted Formal  Education) and Newcomers will receive small group targeted instruction from the classroom teachers as  well as the ENL teacher.  They will also receive individual tutoring from cluster teachers, parent volunteers,  student teachers, and other pedagogues.   Long Term ELL students and ELLs who are in the program  between 4 and 6 years will receive small group targeted instruction and individual tutoring.  These students may also receive  referrals for evaluations to determine if services other than ENL are necessary.  If it is determined that the students need  special education services, they may receive Collaborative Team Teaching, Special Education Teacher Support Service and/or  counseling.       Former ELLs are entitled to support for two years after testing proficient.  An "open door" policy is in  place for former ELLs as well.  The ENL teacher consults with the teachers of former ELLs and encourages  on-going communication to ensure the continued learning success of these students.  Additionally, former  ELLs will continue to be eligible to attend the many after-school programs offered throughout the year. In addition, a summer  enrichment program has been offered to all ELLs.             6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?      ELLs who are also classified as students with disabilities are provided additional support from the ENL   teacher in the form of instructional strategies to scaffold learning, as well as counseling for students to   encourage self-advocacy in their learning process.  The ENL teacher attends regular meetings as well as   annual IEP meetings for her students.  In addition, required support services personnel work cooperatively   with the ENL teacher to provide the best possible instructional plan for ELLs, while at the same time   assisting these students in their learning and remediation process.      Instructional strategies include: providing comprehensible input, emphasizing communication and  understanding, integrating literacy with content areas, developing vocabulary, incorporating the writing   process, demonstrating the conventions of English (spelling, grammar, punctuation), using graphic   organizers, and using cross-cultural connections.  These strategies are implemented along with Balanced   Literacy, the school-wide literacy model - Expeditionary Learning, Science and Social Studies Units of Study,   Go Math for K-5.  All students receive differentiated instruction based upon language proficiency level, learning styles, and  individual need.  The students also use Imagine Learning for K-2, and ESL Reading Smart for 3  rd   through 8th grade to  accelerate English language acquisition through the use of technology. They are provided translation glossaries in their native  language as well as accessing dictionary.com to help with vocabulary acquisition.  A variety of tests are translated into the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      students' native language. Chapter 408 ensures all IEP's services are met for ELL-SWD students.         7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?     The school is particularly sensitive to providing flexibility to meet the needs of our ELL-SWD population.  In  the lower grades, the ENL teacher provides push-in support to supplement the regular pull out class time with these  students.  The ENL teacher conferences with teachers, and is in constant dialogue with the members of the SBST personnel to  continually monitor progress and IEP criteria.  In the middle school division, the ENL teacher requests regular reports from the  content area teachers to advise and assist these students to help them become more self sufficient and to become advocates  for their own educational process.  Our students in the self-contained special education classroom in the middle school are  given the opportunity to participate in mainstream content area classes as per recommendation of the teacher and  administrator in order to allow them least restrictive opportunities to enhance learning.        8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.     In addition to ENL instruction, students in all sub groups who are evaluated as needing more support are placed in Math and  ELA small group intervention classes.  Students receive targeted assistance in the areas of Math and Literacy.  In addition,  providers also target intervention in the areas of Social Studies and Science, particularly with relation to reading  comprehension and writing in response to non-fiction reading in the content areas.  Native language support is offered in  intervention groups through the use of bilingual glossaries in the content areas, as well as internet support using translated  texts wherever possible.  Imagine Learning and ESL Reading Smart are individualized computer programs that the students also  use.  These programs support individual needs and reinforce skills through the content area.  SIFE (Students with Interrupted  Formal Education) and Newcomers will receive small group targeted instruction from the classroom teachers as well as the  ENL teacher.  They will also receive individual tutoring from cluster teachers, parent volunteers, student teachers, and other  pedagogues.   Long Term ELL students and ELLs who are in the program between 4 and 6 years will receive small group  targeted instruction, individual tutoring.  These students may also receive referrals for evaluations to determine if services  other than ENL are necessary.  If it is determined that the students need special education services, they may receive  Collaborative Team Teaching, Special Education Teacher Support Service and/or counseling.         9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?         Each year, the ENL teacher evaluates the program, in collaboration with administration and staff to make instructional changes  to better serve her students.  The school continues to apply the ENL learning standards, performance indicators and sample  tasks as a guide to provide modified instruction that supports the English proficiency levels of all ELLs. The design of the  instruction reflects changes to include a greater emphasis on writing in response to reading.  The ENL teacher in conjunction  with the classroom teacher revises the curriculum map for each grade level, and for the coming year, there will be a continued  focus on non-fiction reading comprehension  strategies in addition to continued writing improvement strategies.       In the coming year, the ENL department has a goal to expand the use of technology in the ENL classroom, as well as to provide  additional enrichment, remediation, and support for ELLs in their own classroom environment.  The school currently uses  programs for English Language Learners such as Imagine Learning and ESL Reading Smart, and the goal for the coming year is  to continue to devote more class time for students, as well as to use the data analysis of the programs to target areas of  individual need that can be addressed during small group instruction.  While the use of technology in the classroom is definitely a positive addition to the classroom, the ENL teacher will continue to  evaluate the use of current software and other web sources.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   Our school has never offered and does not currently meet the criteria required to implement a bilingual program.    Should our ELL population meet the criteria in the future, a bilingual program will be established.      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.     The ENL teacher serves as advisor and student advocate in the school for all ELLs.  Students are encouraged to participate in all  aspects of school life such as glee club, drama, art exhibits, sporting events, debate teams and after school programs. An  exclusive ELL morning/after school enrichment program is offered.  In addition, ELL students are offered the opportunity to  participate in a summer program.  ELLs are invited to participate with clarification and encouragement from the ENL teacher  and administration. The ENL teacher and Parent Coordinator make every effort to communicate opportunities for the  schoolwide enrichment programming open to all students (e.g. Millenium and OST). All ELL students are eligible to participate  in any after school program which offers homework assistance, sports, arts and crafts, and technology classes that provide an  opportunity to socialization within the school community.  All communication of school opportunies are offered to parents in their preferred native language.  In addition, the ENL  teachers contact  parents via phone conference to encourage participation.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.     The instructional materials used in the ENL Program include: ENL classroom libraries (Kindergarten through Grade Five), Oxford  Picture Dictionaries and Content Picture Dictionaries with workbooks, Scholastic Children’s Dictionaries, Journeys ELL  materials, Quizlet, SRA Photo Library, Phonics for Newcomers.  The ENL teacher uses technology such as ESL Reading Smart  and the Imagine Learning Computer Program, internet resources, graphic organizers, charts, literature, poetry, guitar  instruction and music appreciation, and NYSESLAT preparation materials.  Students use laptop computers in all  groups.  Instructional materials are differentiated according to age and proficiency level. Hands-on projects are stressed  overall, and the use of realia and other manipulatives are a standard for all sub-groups.  All resources are age and proficiency  level appropriate.       In the coming year, the ENL department has a goal to provide additional enrichment, remediation, and support for ELLs in their  own classroom environment.  The school currently uses programs for English Language Learners such as Imagine Learning and  ESL Reading Smart, and the goal for the coming year is to continue to devote more class time for students, as well as to use the  data analysis of the programs to target areas of individual need.    While the use of technology in the classroom is definitely a positive addition to the classroom, the ENL teacher will continue to  evaluate the use of current software and other web sources.        13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?      Home language support is given regularly to ELLs, particularly those Newcomers and SIFE students as they transition into their  new environment.  Ipads, online translation tools, glossaries, audio books, and native language editions of literature are among  the regular support given.  Translation and bi-lingual support is also made available whenever possible.        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.       All ELL's are placed in their appropriate grade level based on birth dates.  The ENL teacher strives to ensure that required  services for ELLs do support their learning at all ages and grade levels.  The ENL teacher collaborates with the classroom  teachers to promote the academic success of all ELL students.  The teachers communicate the needs of their students,  and the  ENL teacher makes sure that the proper resources are available at all ages and grade levels.  The special ed provider along with  the ENL teacher will adapt and modify instructional materials as well as insure all ELL-SWD's receive the services and resources   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      mandated as per the IEP.        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Our school is a K-8 school that occupies two buildings.  There is an Early Childhood Center that houses grades Pre-K and 2  of four second grade classes. The main building houses two second grade classes- 8th grade.  One ENL teacher services the  ELLs and FELLs in the Early Childhood Center, and another ENL teacher services the ELLs and FELLs in the main building. We  meet on Mondays to attend ambassador meetings.  On non-ambassador meeting Mondays, we meet to share best practices  and debrief on the weekly progress of our students.  We also collaborate to devise staff development workshops that keep our  staff up to date on expectations and modifications for ELLs.    We attend SIOP workshops as well as other ELL workshops that  keep us current with best practices.  In addition, we continually communicate via telephone and technology to problem solve  as questions and situations arise.  During the months of September when enrollment is taking place, and April when the  NYSESLAT is being administered, both teachers work between the 2 buildings to support each other.        16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   The school makes every effort to support newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year.  At registration, the  family is given a packet of resources including community organizations and other outside programs for enrichment and  language instruction prior to the start of school.  The school also invites ELL participants to the summer school language  programs for continued English language support.  The students are also able to access Imagine Learning and ESL Reading  Smart year round so that they can practice the skills they have already acquired in addition to having the opportunity to learn  new skills.  These programs are individualized so that each ELL student's needs are met, and teachers have direct access so that  they can monitor the progress of their students.  Parents are provided with an Information Session to demonstrate how to use  these programs. The parents are also introduced to the parent coordinator, Donna Pimpinella, and are given contact  information for any questions that may arise.    Communication is vital to successful transitioning at P.S. 207.  Being a K-8 school, teachers and  administrators strive to make the ELL transition a successful experience through articulation and  orientation of students as they make the change to the upcoming grade.  From Grade 1 to Grade 2,  students move to the new building, and they receive an orientation prior to the start of the school year.  Students transitioning to the P.S. 207 Fillmore Academy (the school's middle school 6-8 component) also  take part in an orientation.  The guidance department, Mrs. Cortez and Ms. Morales, are an integral part in the high school  transition.  They attend all mandated DOE training.  The guidance counselor meets with each student individually to discuss  options for high school and helps choose schools that would best meet their needs and future aspirations.  Students are  guided through the application process, and given information and study skill training to prepare for the demands of the new  year.  All ELL students are part of this process, and the ENL teacher reinforces the information to ELL students, offering  clarification and translated information to families if needed.             17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?       All students, including ELLs,  in the middle school have the opportunity to study Spanish as a foreign language.        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57         a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Not Applicable     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?    The ENL teachers provide professional development for the entire staff each year so that all personnel are  made aware of the components of the ENL Program, current data trends, and new methodologies.  They take place  periodically throughout the year.  The topics for professional development include: Identifying ELL students through the Home  Language Information Survey, NYSITELL and NYSESLAT testing administration, results data, language acquisition and  proficiency, ENL methodologies, cultural sensitivity/parental involvement, challenges for ELL students and how they can be  supported as they transition from one school level to another, and use  of technology support such as Imagine Learning and ESL Reading Smart.     Teachers that have ELL students are notified in June for the upcoming year about the number of ELL's they  will have in their room.  Paraprofessionals are also notified when they are working with ELL students.  Time is designated for  school staff to meet individually with the ENL teacher during the first 2 days of professional development to review data and to  see if there are any new ELL admits.  The ENL teacher provides support, materials, ideas, and strategies to help teachers and  paraprofessionals support the ELL's in their classroom. School leaders meet individually with classroom teachers to review data  and check progress on ELL students.  If professional development is available through the network, school leaders will send  these teachers for additional support and training.  The ENL teacher offers additional professional development during faculty  and grade conferences throughout the school year.  This is in alignment with the Common Core State Standards.                2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.     The ENL teacher participates in workshops and seminars throughout the year and turnkeys this information  to the staff at regular monthly faculty conferences and other professional development sessions.  A minimum of fifteen  percent of the required professional development hours for all teachers prescribed by CR Part 154.2 is dedicated to language  acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrated language and content instruction for  English Language Learners.  For the ENL teacher, a minimum of 50% of the required professional development hours are  dedicated to language acquisition in alignment with core content area instruction, including a focus on best practices for co- teaching strategies and integrated language and content instruction for English language learners.  To fulfill our professional  development requirements, the ENL teachers attend Ambassador meetings the last Monday of every month.  Study groups  discuss and analyze the text "Common Core for the Not-So-Common Learner" by Dove/Honigsfeld.  During professional  development time on Mondays, we turnkey information learned from the Ambassador meetings to the rest of the school  staff.  Sign-in sheets and agendas reflect topics and participation.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58            Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Based on NYSITELL and NYSESLAT results, the needs of the ELL students are examined and parents are contacted via phone  conference or in person conferences scheduled during parent engagement.  In th event this time is not convenient for the  parent, arrangements are made to meet before or after school hours with the ENL teacher. At this meeting, ENL teachers  discuss strengths and weaknesses noted from a variety of formative and summative assessments.  ENL teachers collaborate  with content area teachers to determine areas of weakness and provide parents with strategies such as computer websites to  assist at home.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Mary Bosco, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Elizabeth G.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      We continue to review all data available including the school report card, home language surveys. The home  language identification survey includes a section where parents provide their written and oral preference for  communication with the school. In addition, our meetings with new parents continue to support the finding that  the number of non-English speaking parents is increasing. Very often, a student is not considered an ELL after  screening and subsequent NYSITELL testing; yet one or more parent at home speaks a language other than  English. Our Parent Coordinator has created a data base of parents who prefer communications in a language  other than English, which was collected during the registration process. The school will also identify the preferred  language of written communication using the RAPL report in ATS. The RAPL is printed every September and  January. A DOE "preferred language form" will be provided to each new family to confirm the preference on RAPL.  A DOE "preferred Language Form" is provided to each newly registered student. The Language Access Coordinator  will update the Translated Document each September and June, and whenever a new student is registered or a  request is made by a parent. Students are also given Emergency Contact cards on the first day of school. On these   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63      cards, there is also a section for preferred written and oral communication. We make every effort to provide  translated documents and interpretation services to these families. The Office of Translation and Interpretation's  data base also proves to be a viable resource for written communications as well as telephone interpretation. In  addition, bilingual staff provide translated communication whenever possible for other "in-house" writing.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.
