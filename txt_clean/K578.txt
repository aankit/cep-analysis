This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          6     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Brooklyn Bridge Academy High School (herein referred to as BBA) is a non-traditional high school that prepares  students for graduation and post-secondary success. Through academic rigor, individual support, and community  partnerships, students become actively engaged in their education and learn to make informed decisions about their  lives and their futures.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Brooklyn Bridge Academy is a high school focused on re-engaging learners who are over-aged, under-credited and  who were not successful in a traditional environment. Their entry point to BBA reflects their challenges in meeting the  New York State Standards, the new Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS), Regents goals, and preparing for life,  college, career, and beyond.    As a transfer school, BBA, embraces a vision of college and career readiness for our students that is anchored in the  belief that every student is a unique learner whose interest and passions we seek to spark and enhance through an  enriched classroom and positive school experiences. Our students benefit and persevere from strong partnership with  teachers, leaders, and all members of the school community who consider the academic success of our learners as  their central mission. We are committed to shaping students’ academic skills, drawing on their personal resilience and  increasing their academic performance. The goals of ensuring that students are prepared with the academic and life  skills that are aligned to Common Core Learning Standards are essential across all academic departments.   During the last school year, BBA was able to strengthen several areas which have been part of our overall goals. We  continued to develop and transformed our school culture into one that is focused on student learning and success,  staff development and growth and family engagement. We examined the instructional pillars and ensured alignment  of our work to NYCDOE Instructional Expectations.    Through whole group and individual professional development, we focused on developing teachers’ ability to build  student critical thinking skills through an intense focus on reading comprehension and writing. The staff participates  in many staff developments over the summer and continues on a by-weekly basis. This year 3 teachers participated in  the Learning Partners Program and shared their learning experiences with the entire BBA staff. These teaching and  learning opportunities have a strong emphasis on the Common Core Learning Standards and the New York State  Standards, high impact differentiated and academic language development strategies, including Learner- centered/Literacy strategies, Bloom’s Taxonomy and higher-order thinking skills. The strategies informed teachers of  the importance of creating a classroom learning experience and environment with high levels of student engagement.  Teachers hold all students to high expectations and recognize incremental progress as success. Teachers will work  with administration to review ratings and create specific learning targets around the teaching framework. These  learning targets will be assessed by bi-weekly benchmarks and continuous feedback throughout each cycle.    The school administration shared data on the students and encouraged teachers to learn about students’ literacy  levels, build on prior knowledge, teach to different learning styles and reflect on how they can teach the oral, visual,  auditory, and kinesthetic learners.      Our Learning Culture and Expectations       Students will develop the skills of using evidence to support arguments in discussion, which will then transfer to  stronger writing in literacy and math, and develop the communication and collaboration skills that support college  and career readiness.       Student will respond to Quick Writes. The use of “quick writes” is a practice that we continue to build on so that we  are not only improving regents’ scores to passing but we are preparing our students for college.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      Students will engage in high -quality discussions, exemplified by responding to and extending each other’s thinking  and crafting questions to help each other deepen and elaborate upon their thinking. Teachers will use question stems,  in order to facilitate high levels of discussions.    Students will become independent in developing higher level questions for the purpose of academic discussion across  BBA classrooms.    The learning tasks and activities are aligned with the instructional outcomes and are designed to challenge student  thinking, resulting in active intellectual engagement by most students with important and challenging content, and  with teacher scaffolding to support that engagement. The pacing of the lesson is appropriate, providing most students  the time needed to be intellectually engaged.   Partnerships to Support College and Career       Brooklyn Bridge Academy is founded in conjunction with New Visions and CAMBA. Our core value is the social- emotional component of the child must be addressed prior to addressing the academic skills. This collaboration is  essential in the development for the school model, instructional framework, and leads to college and post-secondary  readiness. We continue to move forward by aligning our understanding of student-focused instructional practice.  Teachers use various strategies to address readiness, and learning styles in a student-centered environment. Our  Foundations classes in English, Math, and Science are designed for new students entering B.B.A. Students are taught  skills in preparation for Regents based courses. This is evident in the increased passage rates of the regents.    Our learning culture includes:    Dedicated counselors and social workers provided by CAMBA . Each counselor works with students and families  from the moment they are admitted in order to establish goals, outline academic and behavioral expectations, create  a plan for graduation, and develop a relationship with the family.    Our learning environment which presents college information     Speaker forums    College Trip    Parent Workshops     Tools including: Datacation       The school continues to make great progress with a supportive environment and a collaboration form for teachers.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Overaged undercredited youth require additional emotional and academic support.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Moving Our Agenda Forward   In collaboration between teacher and administrator, an action plan was created to support the teacher’s progression  to the next level. Teachers meet individually with the administrator every two months to review and monitor progress  towards outcomes. Modifications are made as necessary. Teachers meet in departments and in inter-disciplinary  teams to continue learning and to monitor progress of all students at the school.   Teachers continue to receive the following supports to develop their individual professional capacity:    • weekly participation in grade level team meetings;   • inter-visitations and demonstration lessons;   • peer mentoring;    • formal and informal observation feedback.

Our Assessment Plan   Given the organizational structure of BBA accelerating credit recovery assessment is central to helping meet our  mission for our learners.   • Bi-weekly assessment aligned to CCLS, academic course goals, and Regents goals  • Informal assessments which include: quick writes, quizzes, projects, and unit exams.  • Regents Exams (January and June)   • RCT (Special Education Students/Final Year June)    ● Create family seminars and workshops    Our needs assessment started with the implementation of various formal and informal assessments. We will continue  to collect data related to our students’ strengths(writing) and needs for skill remediation through the creation of  score reports for the ELA and Math Acuity Periodic Assessment, Progress Report, HSST/ATS, Regents data, our  December Mock Regents and January Regents exams. We design action plans interpreting this data and design action  plans for the improvement of our instructional practice. We also use the Bi-Weekly Assessment Progress Reports to  identify areas for additional supports including counseling, case management and attendance outreach. We identified  goals for our students and articulate high expectations through individual goal setting with students through behavior  management plans, Individual Graduation Plans and Individual Student Action Plans. Each department works on a  lesson study protocol to target specific students and improve teacher craft. The school has strong teacher teams and  continues to shapes each department. Our baseline assessments provide the faculty with areas to focus on specific  teaching strategies. Bi-Weekly assessment is provided to every student to measure progress.

In  addition, teachers  participate in the  following programs  and/or work with  consultants     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.  Strategies to address the needs of students with  disabilities, English language learners, and other high- need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited,  SIFE, STH).   B.B.A’s Theory of Action, is centered on building teacher capacity  through job-embedded professional development structures and  the self-efficacy of students through a community of care givers.  Each department has an action plan and has reviewed the  Danielson’s framework by dissecting and analyzing the  components making sure we understand the expectations for  each category.      Domain 1: Planning & Preparation      Item analysis of NYS Regents and BARS leads to revision  of the curriculum. This backwards planning method  allows for the breakdown of the content based on  academic importance. The content lends itself to us  defining the skills necessary to be successful. Each skill is  based on overarching goals for the content. This leads to  assessment design which is connected to the skills and  content that needs to be taught within the classroom,  leading to fluidity in all aspects of developing the  curriculum.     This same approach is used when thinking with regards  to the elective classes that are within the department.  We as a department figure out the content we wish to  teach, move on to the actual big ideas and skills we wish  for students to know, and then create the assessments  that would adequately test the skills. These assessments  tend to be more literacy based, because they are tied to  the CCSS 1 & 8 because they lend themselves to citing  evidence and defending ones point of view.     Monthly meetings with parents and teachers     Teachers will meet three times a week in   interdisciplinary teams.     Teachers will be engaged in a lesson study cycle   throughout the year.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          22           3b – Parent and Family Engagement   How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Collaborative Teachers and strategies  to promote teacher-parent/family collaborations in order to support their children at home?

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37            IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Brooklyn Bridge Academy, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A  of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      Brooklyn Bridge Academy will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students         ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement  level, e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology;  ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning  and decision making in support of the education of their children;  ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support  and monitor their child’s progress;  ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;  ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format,  and in languages that parents can understand;  ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to  improve outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between  parents and other members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of  the school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School  Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their  members for additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the  school’s Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the  implementation of the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;  ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are  allocated directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting  skills;  ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and  strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team,  the Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes  providing technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership  skills;   ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and  families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the  assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school  environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of  events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.;  ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational  accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and  support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;   ●provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report,  Quality Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;     host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1st of each school year to advise  parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their  right to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section  1118 and other applicable sections under the ESSA;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the  morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of  the Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions;  ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;   ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations  and workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40             ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;  ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the  school year;  ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent- Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee;  ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;  ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;  ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;  ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of  their children’s progress;  ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed  about school activities and student progress;  ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a  format, and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  We use the data to see how students perform and what we need to do in order to help ELLs succeed. Our main objective is to  graduate as many of our students as possible. ELLs get additional time to work with teacher/teachers in order to improve their  language skills, so that they can pass the exams. They participate in Saturday school (Regents Prep).  BBA is a transfer school.  After we admit the students, we check their transcripts and information about their language skills. Teachers, advisors and  administration work closely together to see where the students should be placed, what courses the student must take and  what ESL needs the student has. Based on the previous data and information that we receive from teachers, we provide the  student with the needed extra/ESL help.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45           3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Our Community Gatherings at the end of every Cycle serve as a culminating event for each trimester/cycle and provide  students with a more demanding opportunity to speak, write, read and listen to English. Each course is designed in such a way  that it corresponds with students' grade level. We offer Foundations courses and more advance courses, such as Regents Prep  and Post Regents. All of our ELL students receive individualized assistance in the least restrictive environment through mini- conferencing and increased levels of student-to-student interaction. We offer Saturday school to all of our students, including  ELLs. They have the chance to practice ELA and Math. For the upcoming year we will continue with our ESL program and will  work on improving it and offering more resources and help. Computers are available in school and during teaching. Teachers  use power point presentations, smart boards, different level books, etc. Our students, especially our ESL students, are given  many opportunities to succeed. All the resources and services correspond to our ELLs grade levels.         4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?         5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A        6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   We view the data in order to have a better understanding of how the ELLs have improved from previous years. When we see  improvement, we continue enhancing our lessons so that all our ELLs benefit and enhance their language skills. Data  demonstrates where the students are, what we should do as a school to provide students with the necessary help from all  teachers, not only from their ESL teachers. We compare students LAB-R scores with the NYSESLAT scores and see their  improvements, in what areas they need help, we try to understand their language deficiencies and weaknesses in order to  create lessons that will be beneficial to them in the future.        7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?               Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs?

Freestanding ENL program.   The ESL/ELA teachers works with the students regularly. ELLs are programmed to take the same classes/courses that  other students  take but the teachers are aware of the lack of language skills for our ELLs. Therefore, teachers differentiate, use  technology in their  classrooms, students use computers and are given Independent Reading time daily and after school. The ESL teacher  works closely  with other teachers to ensure that ELLs are received the best service. Also the ESL teacher meets regularly with the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46         ELL students  during regular class hours and outside the classroom.

Teachers and students work together to see what the ELL needs  are and  how they can move to the next level. ELLs receiving service 4 to 6 years move to higher courses, such as College Prep or  Culture and  Identity, A Writer's Life, where the level of reading/language is at the highest. Long term ELLs also take high level courses and   electives. ELLs who tested proficient are moved on to either graduating high school or taking College courses.           6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   We use the workshop model, Power Point presentations, use of computer labs and technology in the classrooms. Various level  texts.  Frequent use of libraries/ESL library.  All teachers at BBA create lessons that are easily accessible to all students and especially  to  ELLs. The use of handouts/charts, power point presentations, pictures, modeling, scaffolding are some of the strategies that all  our  teachers at BBA use, so that all students learn at different levels of difficulty. Book End is another strategy that has helped our  students with reading comprehension. Students read independently daily for 20 minutes.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   K578                                                                              School DBN: 18K578  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Because BBA is a transfer school, we use students' information and data that is conducted by their previous  school. We do not assess our students' language skills because we use the information that the students bring  with them. Therefore, we use the information from ATS and students' credit reports to continue servicing them.         2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53   Written Preferred    Percent Written          Oral Preferred    Percent Oral             Language    We use information and  surveys conducted from  previously schools.
