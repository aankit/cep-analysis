This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   As we continue to reflect on previous academic years, we continue to redefine our purpose as a school community. In  doing so, we realized that our vision and mission at the Bilingual Bicultural Mini School continues to evolve. We aim to  ensure that our students understand the concept behind equity and accessibility. Our vision and mission reflect the  ideology that equity and accessibility is a right that each and every single student is entitled to.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      Three years ago, we developed our vision and mission statement with the hope that every student in our school  community would learn how to self advocate for their educational rights. The following statements were developed  and continue to be redefine each year:      Vision Statement: Our students will become lifelong learners, creative thinkers and productive citizens who will  advocate for equity and accessibility as a tool for success.    Mission Statement: We will develop a school that is highly regarded for its dedication to equity and accessibility,  attention to technology, and contributions for developing strong communities. We will do this by engaging students in  rigorous learning opportunities that provide entry points to learning and accessibility to resources. We will ensure to  foster a supportive environment where students are safe and advocate for equity and accessibility as a tool to foster  academic, social and emotional growth.      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   The Bilingual Bicultural Mini School is a small school with a focus on bilingual education and dual language education.  We are located in East Harlem and proudly serve 322 students. Our student demographic consists of 92% Hispanic,  6% African American, 1% Asian or Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander and 1% White. Our student population  includes a high number of identified students classified as Multilingual Learners (41%). Our MLL students represent  various Caribbean Islands and countries across Central America and South America. Our students represent unique  cultures including the Mixtecos who speak Spanish and Mixtec. We are proud to announce that this academic year  2017-2018 our school will be expanding by adding a 3K program and a 4K program. This will increase our student  population by 33 students. It was important for our school to open a 3K and 4K program due to the fact that many  families enrolled in our school needed this service.      Based on our observations and attention to student needs, we have recently revised our Theory of Action. As  educators we have a responsibility to educate our students and a moral obligation to ensure equity and accessibility  for all. The 2016-17 and 2017-18 academic year were strong learning years at our school for both teachers and  students. We engaged in work that focused on learning how to better education Multilingual Learners by partnering  with Dr. Aida Walqui who engaged us in QTEL learning. Over the last two academic years we focused on developing  writing skills through a focused theory of action. The Theory of Action was focused in the area of writing with an  emphasis on Multilingual Learners (MLL) and Differently Abled Students that became the cornerstone of much  learning and growth. As a school community, we worked on teacher development in the area of writing utilizing  Quality Teaching for English Learners (Q-TEL) strategies.    Through tailored learning opportunities with Teachers College, Quality Teaching for English Learners as well as Word  Gen teachers focused on learning how to differentiate learning activities so that all learners in the classroom would be  engaged in grade-appropriate discourse while incorporating newly acquired vocabulary. Teachers also learned how to  raise the level of stamina and volume using scaffolds and guided writing to raise the level of student proficiency in the  area of writing.   Teachers also began to develop their understanding of Universal Design for Learning. With the principles of Universal  Design for Learning (UDL) in mind, teachers refined their practices to design instruction to meet the needs of all  learners in the classroom. A step further than simply differentiating, teachers created lessons that allowed for  multiple means of representation by providing options for perception; options for language, mathematical  expressions and symbols; and various options for maximizing student comprehension. In addition to this, teachers  continue to develop lessons that integrate multiple opportunities for action and expression including providing  opportunities for physical action; providing options for expression and communication; and providing opportunities to  develop students' executive functioning. The final component of UDL that teachers continue to refine is the principal   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      of multiple means of engagement. With this, teachers develop their ability to provide options for recruiting interest  among the students; improving students ability to sustain effort and perseverance; as well as develop students'  abilities to self-regulate.    We are determined to ensure that students in our school obtain writing proficiency and that is why we will continue  our work around our Theory of Action. Based on our year-long observations and what we learned about our students  we have established instructional changes that include providing students with a balanced approach to learning. We  will continue working with Teachers College to implement the reading and writing workshop methodology. This  change is pivotal as it aligns to our Fountas & Pinell assessments and the Fountas & Pinnell Guided Reading  Intervention Program. Our teachers will continue attending calendar days at T.C. which focus specifically in writing  which is aligned to our Theory of Action.      We recognize that our work and practice has to be reflective of who we are serving. As a school community we serve  a large percentage of MLLs and that is why we have committed to utilizing Dr. Aida Walqui's methodology of Quality  Teaching for English Learners (QTEL). Our work with Dr. Walqui during the previous year allowed us to learn how to  best engage students in learning and how to ensure that we are developing language opportunities for our English  language learners. Our work with Dr. Walqui included 4 full days of professional development and yearlong coaching  to build capacity. We hope to continue using QTEL strategies to engage students and to ensure that development of  language is consistent and equitable. Our work with Dr. Walqui has change the method in which we plan our lessons  and has instilled within us the knowledge to ensure that students are being engaged and being afforded the scaffolds  necessary to succeed.       In an effort to ensure that we are on the road to meeting our vision and mission we have equipped every  kindergarten student with an i-Pad. The I-Pad program will be used to reinforce word study and mathematical  concepts. We have also equipped every classroom with state of the art SMART Boards and a document camera to  ensure that technology is used to support students. Additionally, we have a technology lab and we are implementing  a computer club that will focus on teaching students coding and animation. Each and every classroom has desktop  computers with a wifi printer to ensure that students have resources to enhance their learning.    The Bilingual Bicultural Mini School seeks to achieve its vision by living out our mission statement in collaboration  with the school community, parents and following partnerships:     Union Settlement Intergenerational Tutoring Program     CASA/Teatro SEA     City Surfers/Concrete Safaris    America Reads New York University    NYU Learning Partners    Hunter College Student Interns    Bilingual Pupil Services (BPS (Interns)    New York City Soccer Initiative    Music and the Brain    Bubbles    Reading Partners    Asphalt Green            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   The current data 2017-18 shows that 41% of our population are identified as Multilingual Learners; however, this  number doesn’t represent the students who were not identified during the registration intake process. There are a  number of students who speak Spanish at home and have identified Spanish as being their first language; however,  they are not identified as ENL students. For this reason, our school is unique and recognizes that Spanish is the  dominant language representative of our families and students.    Additionally, based on the most current data 2017-18 we have a total of 27.77% of students identified as students  with disabilities (SWDs). This number represents a large number students with Integrated Co-Teaching (ICT) as a  mandated services. For this reason, we further developed the special education program this year by creating new ICT  classes. We also provided professional development to foster strong pedagogical practices within these unique  settings.      In addition, this school year we continued monthly reviews of Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) within the  School Implementation Team. The reviews consist of an analysis of the Present Levels of Performance (PLOP) and it's  alignment to goals and recommended services. We also continue to look at the testing to determine if MLL students  with IEPs are truly learning disabled or if they are being recommended for or assigned an IEP unjustly due to slow  language development. The SIT team leader developed a checklist that teachers continue use to write quality IEPs  that are aligned to what students need. In addition, we ensure that all new cases involving MLL students are reviewed  by the team. This process includes collecting data, assigning team members to visit the student in class and a team  discussion to decide whether the student in question was on track and or if there appeared to be a disability present.          4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Our last Quality Review took place in 2016 and Supportive Environment is the area in which our school made the most  progress. The rating for Supportive Environment in the Q.R. was well developed. This continues to aligned to our most  current ORRS data (2017-18) which shows a decrease in student infractions. This is evident as the data shows the  following:   The 2015-16 data shows a total of 59 infractions across levels 1-4. The 2016-17 data shows a total of 11 infractions  across levels 2-4. The 2017-18 data shows a total of 4 infractions across levels 1-4.    It is obvious that we continue to work and develop our school environment to support students across academics and  social and emotional development.   The most current Q.R. (2016-17) highlighted another element of the Framework for Great Schools in which s  Collaborative Teachers and was rated Proficient. The findings were as follows: Teacher teams consistently analyze  data and student work for students they share. Distributed leadership structures are in place. The impact was  identified as follows: In addition to progress made by students toward writing goals as a result of teacher team inquiry  work, teachers' practices have improved. Across the school, teachers have built leadership capacity and have a voice  in key decisions that affect student learning. This aligns to the current School Survey Data 2017-18 which shows that  for Collaborative Teachers we scored a 3.72 which is higher than the district average by +0.35 percent. In addition  when comparing the data to 2016-17 it shows that we increased in this area from a 3.60 (17-18) to a 3.72 (17-18). In  addition the data shows that the school commitment component for this element was rated at a 4.50 which is higher  than the city and district average. The quality of professional learning was rated at 3.93 which is also higher than the  city and district average. This data reflects our commitment to ensuring that we develop teachers so that student  outcomes can increase. Through our programming and scheduling we ensure that teachers are provided with  opportunities to engage in collaborative conversations around student data and progress. Teachers were given a   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12      handbook that outlined protocols to follow. Teachers met regularly in grade level teams to look at data and to track  their targeted groups. This process allowed teachers to better understand the cycles of collaborative inquiry and the  purpose of the work. Teachers discussed specific students, looked at practices and shared resources.         A key area of focus based on the December 2016 Quality Review and the most current Principal's Performance  Observations (2017-18) show that indicator 1.2, continues to be area in need of improvement. The ratings for this  indicator across the school year were developing. This indicator is of great importance as researchers have found  teacher quality to be highly correlated with student learning and success (Darling-Hammond;1999, Kimball et. al.,  2004; Odden et al., 2004). Based on the two Principal's Performance Observation visits and Q.R., this is a key area of  focus and we must ensure that we are developing curricula and differentiating practices across the school and  strengthening teacher practice so that students are provided with multiple entry points, higher order thinking  opportunities and opportunities to engage in conversations that will engage them further (1.2). During a PPO visit  March 2017, the Superintendent stated that some teachers continue to implement teacher centered lessons which  results in minimal opportunities for students to engage.       As a result of our area of focus (1.2) we are refocusing our attention on planning which is aligned to Advance 1e.  During the 2017-18 school year we engaged in a pilot with LDC, Literacy Design Collaborative. This opportunity  allowed a small group of teachers to receive training in backwards planning. The selected teachers participated in  professional learning sessions twice a month as a year long study. The teachers who participated were able to make  improvements in planning and the execution of lessons as noted in their Advance evaluation data. Based on this work  and the current school need around 1.2 Teacher Pedagogical practices we have decided to engage all teachers in this  learning. This school year this is a focused goal that will help us shift practices and impact 1.2 teacher pedagogical  practices.    Through much reflection we realize that making adjustments and modifications to the instructional schedule was not  effective due to the lack of consistency in teaching practices. This academic year we will have new systems and  structures to ensure that 1.2 shifts into effective so that student outcomes can increase. Some structures will include  planning using Understanding by Design, a structure schedule for planning sessions and instructional rounds to  monitor progress towards goals.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 04M182   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   0K,01,02,03,04,05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   310   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   YES   Dual Language   YES   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     This element of the Framework continues to be one that has been discussed throughout the year. We exhibited  strength in understanding where we currently are in this area and in understanding the urgency to shift practice in 1.2  Teacher Pedagogy. This academic year we continued a partnership with Generation Ready which allowed our teachers  to take a deep dive into the standards and to ensure that units, and tasks therein are aligned to grade level standards.  We engaged in 20 professional learning sessions where teachers were honest as to what their needs are in this area  of focus (rigorous instruction). Some of the planning and preparation consisted of developing units that reflected  opportunities for all learners to succeed. Such opportunities included the use of UDL strategies, ensuring that multiple  entry points were evident and scaffolding for students.   During the 2017-18 school year two Principal's Performance observations were conducted. During both a  recommendation to focus on indicator 1.2 was provided. The PPO feedback stated that we need to ensure that we  develop curricula and differentiation practices across the school and that we strengthen teacher practice so that  students are provided with multiple entry points, and higher order learning opportunities. This recommendation was  based on the fact that we should be ensuring all students are engaged and that we are engaging students with  cognitively appropriate tasks that are aligned to the day to day learning targets and grade level standards. A clear  focused area in rigorous instruction is the need to ensure that all students including subgroups such as MLL students  are provided with multiple entry points so that accessibility to learning is available for subgroups. Additionally, we  must provide scaffolds to support subgroups of students such as MLLs and students with Individualized Educational  Plans . Upon our reflection we realized the following problem of practice:   At the Bilingual Bicultural Mini School there are large populations of Multi Language Learners (41%) and Differently  Abled Students (27.77%). We have developed specialized programs that include Dual Language Integrated Co  Teaching. However, teachers continue to struggle to utilize research based strategies to meet the needs of the diverse  learners with rigorous standard based teaching. This results in a lack of foundational skills in reading and writing as  evidenced by the 2017 English Language Arts performance which showed proficiency of only 26%.    We are currently awaiting the 2017-18 results so that we can make a comparison between the two academic years.   As a result, we have implemented changes for the upcoming school year. We will be engaging students in a balanced  approach to learning with a focus on meaningful tasks. We recognize the need to focus on additional professional  development opportunities to ensure teachers shift practice and develop a repertoire of strategies as it relates to  planning rigorous instruction and delivering rigorous instruction. We have established a school wide instructional  focus aligned to components 1e Designing Coherent Instruction and 3c Engaging Students in Learning . Teachers will  practice in study groups and professional learning opportunities that will focus on designing rigorous instruction with  scaffolds and understanding how to use multiple entry points to make learning accessible for all.

In addition, teachers will also participate in study groups that will focus on  looking at the standards for writing; this will be done in an effort to improve writing.    A major shift in our professional learning will include   -LDC training for all teachers   -Implementing and monitoring previously learned strategies (QTEL)   -Infusing instructional rounds to monitor progress and engage in self reflection of practices   We will revise this section as soon as we have the new ELA data to ensure that we identify priority needs   based on current student data.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  Our latest data Quality Review (December 2016) reflect that we are well developed in this area. According to the  Quality Review data findings included structures that allow students to be known by at least one adult in the building.  Additionally, it was stated that our school community strategically aligns professional development, family outreach,  and student learning experiences and supports.   The impact as noted during this visit was recorded as: "Personalized interventions, routines, celebrations and  supports help students learn positive behaviors and result in the adoption of effective academic and personal  behaviors. This continues to aligned to our most current ORRS data (2017-18) which shows a decrease in student  infractions. This is evident as the data shows the following:   The 2015-16 data shows a total of 59 infractions across levels 1-4. The 2016-17 data shows a total of 11 infractions  across levels 2-4. The 2017-18 data shows a total of 4 infractions across levels 1-4.    It is obvious that we continue to work and develop our school environment to support students across academics and  social and emotional development.      However, we recognize the need to educate the whole child by ensuring that we monitor and track their well being  and their social and emotional growth. As a school community we engaged in deep reflection around this element  and realized the following problem of practice:   The students at the Bilingual Bicultural Mini School are passive learners. This is due, in part, to teachers not creating  opportunities for students to meaningfully engage in learning. Furthermore, teacher observations demonstrate a  pattern wherein classroom teachers miss opportunities to build high efficacy among the students in their classrooms.  As a school community, we aim to prove professional learning opportunities around developing students' self  advocacy skills, so that teachers can be able to foster these skills within the classroom and the larger school  environment so that students can take stock of their learning.      Specific research conducted by Fencl and Scheel (2005) indicate that teachers must work on increasing learning  opportunities that can result in developing student efficacy. Our intended action for this element is to provide  professional learning opportunities around developing students' self advocacy skills by building efficacy. We created a  theory of action that states the following:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          21      -If school leaders provide professional learning opportunities around developing students' self efficacy, then the  teachers will be able to foster these skills within the classroom and the larger school environment so that students  can take stock of their learning and advocate for their rights as learners.      This academic year we will explore partnerships with New York University child study center to further develop the  social and emotional state of the students in our school building. The work with NYU will help us adapt strategies to  enhance our Positive Behavior Intervention System by looking beyond the expected behavior matrix and developing a  matrix that examines student efficacy.      Additionally, we will continue to have a character education/peer facilitator who will teach character education and  monitor the social and emotional growth of targeted students across grades 1-5. The peer facilitator will also be  responsible for implementing PBIS (Positive Behavior Intervention System) strategies and procedures that can support  the social and emotional growth of students. We have a school matrix that represents our expectations for student  behavior. We do recognize the need to create a student efficacy matrix to supplement our PBIS system.              Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  The students of the Bilingual Bicultural Mini School will become active participants in their learning by demonstrating  enthusiasm, interest, high levels of motivation, perseverance in the fact of a difficult task and active engagement in  critical thinking student led discussions as evidenced by 60% of teacher reaching effective or highly effective in  component 3c: Engaging students in learning by June 2019.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          22     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   During the 2017-18 school year we partnered with coaches from Literacy Design Collaborative. This partnership  consisted of enhancing pedagogical practices by focusing on the planning of units of study. The LDC focus was based  on the notion of collaboration and to the success of improving student outcomes through planning. The work  consisted of working with coaches to learn best practices that included backwards planning and looking at student  data. Teachers met once a week on Mondays' from 2:50 to 4:00 p.m. Although, we had LDC as a primary resource to  enhance this element of the framework, there is still much work needed to be done to ensure that we are using this  element of the framework to truly impact student outcomes. The data collected during the LDC work demonstrated  that teachers continue to need assistance with planning and revising to meet the needs of all diverse learners.   Recent data such as the 2017-18 School Survey data show that we have made gains in this element of the framework.  The overall score for this element was 3.72 which showed an increase from the 3.60 score that we received during the  2016-17 school year. This score reflects a +0.35 difference as compared to the district average. Some areas of this  element that showed significant growth were school commitment, quality of professional development and peer  collaboration. School commitment had a score of 4.50 which was higher than the district score (+0.17) and higher  than the city score (+0.14). The quality of professional development received an average score of 3.93 higher than the  district average by +0.14 and higher than the city average by +0.8. Peer collaboration was also an area of growth. This  part of the survey averaged a score of 3.50 with 96% of teachers stating that the school principal and teachers  collaborate to ensure the school runs effectively.    Our most recent Quality Review (December 2016) found that we are "proficient" in 4.2. The Q.R. 2016 data states that  teacher teams consistently analyze data and student work for students they share. It was also recognized that we  have distributed leadership in place to build capacity. The impact noted during the Q.R. visit recognized that students  made progress towards their writing goals as a result of teacher team inquiry work. The reviewer also noted that  teacher practices have improved in this area.    We looked at the 2017-2018 New York School Survey in depth. We do celebrate and acknowledge the growth we had.  However, after further analyzing this element and each individual response we found that teachers felt that they  lacked the opportunity to design instructional programs. A total of 84% felt the professional activities did not allow  them the opportunity to create lesson or units of study in collaboration. Based on this data our priority for this  element will focus on developing teachers in this work by providing cycles of professional development that will  support Phase I, Phase II and Phase III of the collaborative inquiry process. Through ongoing professional development  teacher teams will learn to utilize data as a tool in planning instruction and decision making. Resources such as the  collaborative inquiry handbook, data templates and the Collaborative Inquiry Phase documents will be used to  develop teams. Additional accountability will include evaluations of student work and the collection of data.    As a community we had many conversations around student performance, growth and specific needs. We recognize  the need to look at data more closely in an effort to create student plans that can impact student outcomes.

We must also acknowledge the fact that teacher teams have asked for additional professional  development opportunities aligned to collaborative inquiry. This is reflective of teachers wanting to strengthen their  practice to improve student outcomes.   The implementation of structured PLCs has been and will continue to be a focus area. This work is important as it  allows us to address teaching practices that if shifted can impact subgroups such as MLLs and SWDs.

By June 2019, 75% of students will improve their ability to write from sources to demonstrate an understanding of a  grade-level complex text as evidenced by an increase in the coherence, organization and volume of students' writing. In  order to demonstrate mastery of this goal, students must score 3 or higher on the writing from sources rubric.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          27     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.      The most current data available related to this element of the framework is the 2017-18 New York City Survey results.  For this specific element of the framework an average score of 3.68 was obtained. This score reflects a higher average  than the district (+17) and a higher average than the city (+0.07). The following questions found on the survey reflect  a positive score as determined by the survey results:   -100% of teachers say that the principal sets high standards for student learning.   -100 % of teachers say that the principal sets clear expectations for teachers about implementing what they have  learned in professional development.    -96% of teachers say that the principal makes clear to the staff his or her expectations for meeting instructional goals.   -100 of teachers say that the principal carefully tracks student progress   -92% of teachers say that the principal participates in instructional planning with teams of teachers.   Although, the survey data reflects growth across this element, there is still concern as noted in the most recent  Principal Performance Observation. The last two PPOs (December 2017 and March 2018) reflect a developing score  for 1.2 Teacher Pedagogical Practices. The following recommendation was provided during the March 2018 PPO.      "Although the principal has the instructional leadership and capacity, the current level of staff capacity is not yet  consistent across classes. As communicated during the previous PPO conducted on December 13, 2017, during  instruction, some teachers continue to implement teacher centered lessons, which provides minimal opportunities for  student discussion, and differentiation to meet students learning and language needs across the school".  This  recommendation reflects the need to ensure that the implementation of learned strategies is monitored and  weighted heavier in the observation data. During the course of the last twelve months teachers have received training  that focused on learning QTEL strategies and Advance Literacy best practices. However, the implementation of the  research based practices has not been consistent across all classrooms.    Some of the next steps associated with addressing this need are as follows:  "Continue to deepen the professional development to support teachers' instructional practices and capacity to  employ the gradual release methods which will move them from teacher centered to student centered classes, which   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          32      will support engagement in appropriately challenging tasks, demonstrate higher order thinking and increase  differentiation to meet the students' language and learning needs".         The most recent Advance data shows that 39.58% of teachers are developing in component 3c Engaging Students in  Learning. A total of 8.33 % of teachers are ineffective in component 3c. In total 47.91% of teachers are not meeting  the expectations set forth in this component which affect 1.2 Teacher Pedagogical Practice. The data also shows a  mean average score of 2.68% for component 3c and a mean average score of 2.58% for component 3b. This data is  aligned to the PPO recommendation as noted above.       Upon reflection it is obvious that we must provide opportunities for teachers to understand how students learn best  today versus how students have been taught at BBMS for the course of the last 30 years. Pedagogical practices must  shift and change as the school needs change. However, it is noted that some teachers struggle with their core belief of  how students learn best.    Most recently we have partnered with the Manhattan Field Support Center to redefine our core beliefs. The idea of  redefining our core beliefs is essential as we have invested funds in professional development that has not resulted in  a shift in practice across some classes.       We acknowledge that we must continue to grow in this area because our goal is to impact teacher practice so that  student outcomes are higher. For this reason, we have decided to partner with Learning Science International.    Learning Sciences International’s (LSI’s), Ignite Core Instruction PD series is comprised of in-person sessions with  integrated technology-based supports and metrics designed to help teachers and school leaders strengthen core  instruction to results-driven outcomes, including igniting students to increase:   • Ownership of their learning process   • Cognitive engagement in rigorous tasks aligned to the academic standards   • Teamwork for development of new economy skills for the 21st century   LSI blends training, coaching, and a suite of classroom and leadership tools to produce sustainable transformations  (with visible next-day results) in core instruction. The work with LSI will focus on retraining teachers through the lens  of school transformation. This is crucial as BBMS needs a transformation in an attempt to meet the needs of all  diverse learners. The work will begin with dissecting the vision and redefining our core belief. The overall goal of LSI is  to further develop leadership skills in an attempt to increase teacher effectiveness which will impact student  outcomes. Developing teacher effectiveness will include holding teachers accountable for providing students with the  necessary rigor to succeed. The LSI plan is a yearlong plan that will include -the following buckets.   -Forging a Vision   -Igniting Student Ownership   -Enhancing Standards Tracker Usage   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33      -Engaging Productive Teams   -Study group using "Who Moved My Standards" Joyful Teaching in an Age of Change.   All of the buckets listed above are aligned to the CEP goals reflective throughout this document. We will focus on  providing students the ability to take ownership which will increase student efficacy. We will focus on the vision and  redefining core belief which will allow teachers to further understand student efficacy and needs. We will use the  standards tracker to ensure that rigor is present in the delivery of instruction. We will focus on empowering teacher  teams so that collaboration is maximize.    It is our goal to ensure that we monitor teacher effectiveness and provide the necessary development to ensure that  all students receive instruction from effective and highly effective teachers.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Our school community has a positive climate that allows visitors to feel welcome. This is evident in the 2017-18  Survey data which indicates that 97% of families say that they are greeted warmly when they call or visit the school.  We also ensure that we communicate with families in their language so that they feel comfortable and as part of the  community. The Survey data also shows that 98% of families say that their school communicates with them in a  language and in a way they can understand.   As a school community we strongly believe that external resources are essential. Our external resources consist of  organizations that support us in different ways. Below are some of the key organizations that assist us in ensuring we  work towards meeting our school goals.   Union Settlement: Union Settlement is unique as they provide us various types of services that help us in different  ways. One service that is provided is the Reading Tutoring Service. This service consists of targeting the most  struggling students in grades 1-3 and helping them develop the love for reading that has not been developed.  Students are serviced in a one to one ratio so that the student feels comfortable and willing to take risks. The Union  Settlement Tutor teachings the struggling reader how to read but most of all how to fall in love with reading. The  program is year long and ends with a celebration where certificates are given along with some reading resources. Of  course, there is a party where kids are able to celebrate their accomplishments.   Union Settlement also sponsors an after school program called, Photos and Me. This is a unique opportunity that  targets one of our subgroups- Multi Language Learners. There are two classes a grade two and a grade three class.  Each class has about twenty participants. This yearlong study allows students to study culture through images and to  develop language along the way.   Union Settlement also provides our families with social services that include mental health services and counseling.       Other partners helping us along the way are:  -Bubbles   -Concrete Safaris   -Asphalt Green   -Society of Educational Arts   -NYU America Reads   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      -New York Football Club      The Society of Educational Arts has been instrumental in providing our students with enrichment opportunities that  enhance language development and cognitive development. For the pass three years, SEA has led an after school  program focusing on several Arts Discipline. We offer visual arts, dance and theatre to students via an after school  program. The after school program is sponsored through a grant so it is free to all our students. This partnership  allows our students the opportunity to engage in enrichment learning that forces development of critical thinking  skills. Some of the culminating projects include murals, dance recitals and short plays. Students enjoy this learning and  it is evident through their participation, attendance and commitment to the art discipline.    Our young men are supported by the New York Football Club which focuses on helping young men develop socially  and emotionally. Although, the soccer after school program is opened to young girls, we currently have no girls  enrolled. The young men who participate in this program have NYFC coaches that teach them skills across  sportsmanship, collaboration team work and perseverance. This is a crucial partnership that has supported our  students and helps us support families. The NYFC provides us with football tickets so that parents and their children  are able to attend games together. This type of action allows parents to support their children and to spend quality  time with their children.       Although, we have several positive aspects of this framework in place, we recognize the need to shift our mindset so  that we can deepen our parental engagement and involvement. Our school community became reflective upon  analyzing our 2017-18 Survey results. The survey has a section that looks at how parents feel about parental  involvement at the school level. Specifically, the question asked if parents were afforded the opportunity to volunteer  time to support the school. This question averaged a result rate of 58% with a score of 1.60. This was eye awakening  as we thought we were engaging parents. This resulted in a gap between the district of -0.80% and city of 0.08%. As a  school community we had to examine what we did different during the 2017-18 school year. We compared our 2016- 17 results to that of the 2017-18 result and found that in 2016-17 we averaged a score of 3.39 while this academic  year we averaged a 2.91. This element of the framework was our lowest score on the survey. It is also the one area  that we did not make any growth in and actually declined.       Ironically enough, the parents in our school community felt that they had trust in decisions made by the school  leader. This part of the survey had a score of 95% and it was higher than the district and city average. We realized that  because parents do trust us- we have a responsibility to ensure that we involve them more in our school community.  During the month of June we took time to speak to parents and to address this concern in our School Leadership  Team meetings. As we received feedback, we realized that our parents have a lot to offer to our school community.  They have rich cultural knowledge and folklore stories that can take you on a journey.       We recognize the need to shift our practices so that parental involvement can truly increase and so that parents feel  that they are making meaningful contributions. Some of the new practices will include:      -Scheduled classroom visits during Science Instruction: This is essential as we engage in hands on experiments and  parent volunteer can assist in preparing materials alongside the teacher for the investigations. There will be 6 visits  schedule where parents can visit and volunteer.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39         A balanced outlook to scheduling volunteers. All parents will receive a survey which will ask if they have an interest to  volunteer. They will have options to choose from. Based on that information we will organize ahead of time volunteer  schedules so that parents are able to plan ahead. This method will help us truly capture a picture of what interest  parents have and it will allow parents the flexibility to volunteer for events they feel passionate about or have a high  interest towards      Open Tuesdays will shift to include one Tuesday a month where parents can meet in grade level bans to express  concerns or generate ideas for events or learning. This type of session will allow parents to have a voice and to be  included in the decision making.          We currently communicate with parents through the following structures:   School Messenger: Phone messages   E-Chalk Website: Emails and school page   Progress Reports   Monthly School Calendars   Grade Level Newsletters   It is our goal this year to ensure that we increase parent satisfaction and that parents are invited more frequently to  visit the school and to volunteer in the school.

The most  current  data  reflects  that there  are eight  students  in  temporary  housing.      2. Please describe the services you are planning to provide to the STH population.   One of our CEP goals is focused on the social and emotional development of students. As part of this goal, our job will  include creating plans of assistance for families that are in temporary housing.   One of the first steps we are taking is to establish a relationship between our school and the local shelters. This task  will be taken by the school guidance counselor. We hope to have some type of contact and communication  established with all local shelters in East Harlem by October 2018.   It has been our routine and practice that students who are in temporary housing receive at risk counseling services.  This practice will continue this academic year.   Additionally, we will ensure families receive support; this will include but will not be limited to transportation, school  supplies, uniforms, coats and any other winter clothing that the child might need. This will be done in conjunction  with Change for Kids and other external organizations that have established partnerships with us. The school supplies  include book bags, pencils, notebooks, and any other instructional supplies needed.   Our partnership with Union Settlement will continue so that they can support us in providing family counseling to  families in need. This will be determined based on the students social and emotional development, class grades, and  attendance.      Part B: FOR NON-TITLE I SCHOOLS   1.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  The Bilingual Bicultural Mini School has a veteran staff that has spend the majority of their careers at BBMS. Many of  our teachers have educated generations of families which has created a true sense of community and has fostered  trust and confidence in our ability to educate and care for their children. This sense of community is reflected in the  number of years the majority of the staff has served this school community.   Sixteen of the twenty five members of our faculty have been teaching in our school for a minimum of ten years. We  attribute the high retention rate of our teaching staff to the strong professional development program, which  addresses teacher needs, and strengths, as well as a strong mentoring program. Our partnership with the City  University of New York student teaching program contributes to our recruitment efforts. In addition, the principal is  instrumental in building capacity within the staff. Teachers are afforded opportunities to chair committees, spearhead  new instructional approaches, and conduct primary research on the best teaching techniques currently available.  Lastly, but very important there is shared vision among staff that sustains staff stability . Regarding teacher  assignments, teachers are given a preference sheet at the end of the school year and through administrator and  teacher dialogue, teacher assignments are made. The goal of this process is to ensure that all teacher assignments are  made so that students will most benefit from the teacher’s experience, qualifications and expertise.         2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   Our professional development activities will include learning sessions focused around Professional Learning  Communities. The PLC series will be aligned to school goals, theory of action, and Advance data for individual teachers  and groups of teachers. The PLCs will take place every Monday of the school year; this particular PLC will focus on  ensuring that we are meeting school goals and that we are all working towards the Theory of Action. The second  series of PLCs will take place on Tuesdays' after the parental engagement block. The focus of the Tuesday work will be  based on teacher needs based on the Advance Data. One example of a particular PLC is the UDL PLC which is being  offered to teachers who score developing on component 3c and to all new teachers. The professional development  plan will included opportunities for all teachers based on their current pedagogue practices and learning needs.    The alignment between the Advance data and professional learning opportunities will provide us with the ability to  ensure that we shift teacher practice. Shifting teacher practice will ensure that teachers are maximizing instructional   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51      time and that will impact student outcomes. Learning how to align standards with what is being taught, learning how  to effectively provide multiple entry points, and how to differentiate instruction are all focused learning sessions that  will impact teacher practice and student outcomes.   This school year we will also work with Learning Science Institute in an effort to go deeper with the teacher  effectiveness concept. LSI will assist us in developing teachers understanding of the new standards and how to  incorporate rigor to enhance student outcomes. LSI will also help us develop a students ability to become self aware  of their potential, owners of their learning, and self advocates.         Part 3: TA Schools Only   3a.

Our school has began the process of visiting pre schools in the East Harlem area. This is being done so that we begin  establishing relationships with parents. We have informational sessions in where we introduce our school focus,  provide information, and invite parents to tour our school.      As an effort to ensure an effective transition we have a screening process to identify reading and writing readiness for  all incoming kindergarten students.   ● Parent school tours with local head start programs hosted by the Principal and /or Parent Coordinator .   ● Turning five special education evaluation process for entering kindergarten students.        4b.

The committee was composed of six teachers representing all grades level (K-2 and 3-5) as well as  teachers who teach other disciplines. The committee reviewed assessments identified by the state and city as well as  universal assessments used at the school level. The committee selected from each category to measure student  progress. Through teacher teams, professional development is provided to analyze assessment results listed below in  order to inform instruction.   1. State ELA and Math Results – Item Skills Analysis   2.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds.

IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. The Bilingual Bicultural School in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I,  Part A of theEvery Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   The Bilingual Bicultural School will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● Actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● Engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● Ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● Support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● Maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● Conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● Provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      ● Host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the No Child Left Behind Act;   ● Schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● Translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● Conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting workshops during parent engagement time (Tuesday's); the parent engagement time will be used to engage  parents in learning-specifically related to our units of study across math and literacy. We will use the Tuesday time to  meet and debrief with parents (2x a month) and workshops will be provided (2x month).   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● a parent handbook will be distributed which contains parent and students bill or rights, resources for CBOs, and  school policty.   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      School-Parent Compact (SPC)       School-Parent Compact (SPC)   The Bilingual Bicultural School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act  (ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement  between the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by  Title I, agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for  improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure  that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

Our supplemental instruction will  continue for the 2018-2019 school year.  It will include adding an additional two units of FOSS  Science learning. Through FOSS investigations students will have opportunities  to learn content and to explore concepts through hands- -on learning opportunities.  The  investigations provide opportunities to develop content vocabulary and make connections  between the vocabulary words and the hands on materials. Additionally, students will be able to  work in groups and explore concepts through active conversations that are scaffold so that  students acquire process and content information.  Students will have opportunities to conduct  investigations and to discuss their observations during each investigation. At the end of each  investigations students will be able to write their about this process in a science journal.  These  hands-on investigations which promote discussion and conversations are aligned with our Q- Tel (Quality Teaching for English Learners) initiative which uses strategies to deliver instruction  utilizing UDL strategies that will ensure accessibility for all students.    Teachers will be responsible for delivering a short mini lesson (prior to every investigation) that  will provide multiple entry points (UDL Strategies) to ensure that all students participating have  access to the learning. Such modalities will include anchor charts and video clips to clearly  present the content purpose of each investigation.  This is in alignment with the UDL principal of  providing multiple means of representation of content.   Teachers will activate and supply  background knowledge.  This supports comprehension of the information related to the session's  investigation.  When students share their prior knowledge and/or ideas, this fosters language  development and student engagement.  After the mini lesson, students will engage is active  discussion which can involve making predictions about the investigation. Students will hear, and  see the instructions aligned to each investigation and discuss the process (additional language  development) that will be taken throughout the course of the investigation. Students will need to  read the directions and explore additional content reading at teach station.  Students will work  with partners and/or small groups while reading directions and information at their station.    The investigation learning will allow each student the opportunity to engage in tactile learning  and to make connections between what they are learning and previously learned strategies.  Students will be able to problem solve in groups and brainstorm solutions (developing cognitive  thinking/skills).  During each investigation, opportunities for scaffolded conversations will be  provided. Additionally, each investigation will conclude with a 5 minute group discussion and a  5 minute journal entry.  The goal for using the FOSS Investigations is to ensure that additional opportunities to enhance  vocabulary development, language acquisition, reading and writing skills and to ensure that  continued cognitive development is evident through our instructional practices. This  supplemental program is available for all students categorized as entering, emerging and  transitioning.  All students will be instructed at grade level with appropriate supports to ensure  that language development is taking place. Students will also be allowed to use dictionaries in an  effort to ensure that they have additional means to access content and information.

This program allows us to further academic and social skills and a huge emphasize is placed on  higher order skills such as interpreting, applying, synthesizing, inferring, etc. The skills outlined  are also aligned to the ENL Standards as identified by New York State. We aim to provide  students with a unique learning opportunity that will motivate them to engage and also commit to  their own learning. ENL students need learning experiences that will allow them the opportunity  to truly engage in higher order thinking. Our students will be equipped with all the resources  necessary to ensure that their learning experiences related to scientific investigations is  meaningful and impacts their developmental level across reading, writing, speaking and  listening.  Our Title III program will begin on December 2018 and conclude April 2019.  We will provide  instruction to students in grades Kindergarten through fifth grade. The first part of the Title III  program will focus on servicing students in grades Kindergarten through fifth grade. The  program will consist of at least 60 students.  The ENL after school classes will be conducted  every Wednesday and Thursday from 3:00 P.M. to 4:30 P.M. for a total of 40  sessions of supplemental support per school year. The language of instruction will be English.  The staff will consist of 3 certified bilingual teachers, and 1 supervisor.   The FOSS  Investigations are leveled in grade bands as follows:  K-1, 2-3, and 4-5; resulting in needing  three teachers for the program. The school will assign three educational assistants (one for each  identified class) to assist the teacher will all investigations. The educational assistants will not be  paid through the Title III budget.  The supervisor assigned will develop the structure of the program, provide materials, conduct  classroom observations, and provide feedback that can shift teacher practice so that student  outcomes have a positive end result. The supervisor will also be responsible for conducting  workshops that assist teachers in understanding how to collect and analyze student data, how to  differentiate the investigations according to UDL principals and how to use modalities that can  maximize instructional learning opportunities.  The cost of new materials will be $2,448 for books, charts, notebooks, and writing  materials.  The books that will be used in this program are FOSS content readers and books will  be aligned to the current unit of study. Additionally each ENL student will receive a science  journal. There will be a left over amount of $133.00 for parent refreshments as we would like to  host several parent workshops relating to support ENL students. The parent workshops will focus  on gallery walks (when students are conducting investigations) that will allow parents the  opportunity to view the program in action and to also participate in at least one investigation with  their child.  Students report their interest in engaging in hands-on exploration.  At the end of the 2018- 2019 program, students will complete surveys that will allow them to communicate how  effective they think this learning opportunity was. The purpose of this is to ensure that we are  obtaining feedback that can help us meet the needs of all ENL students. Student voice should  also be taken into account when planning supplemental instruction. It is our goal to provide  learning opportunities that will enhance the overall learning experiences of our ENL students.  Our students deserve access to unique learning experiences that will motivate them and enhance  their development levels as the year progresses.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65      rationale  teachers to receive training   schedule and duration  topics to be covered  name of provider   Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.    ·  ·  ·  ·  ·  Begin description here:             Professional development will be conducted on site by the site supervisor and professional  learning coach. During the 2017-2018 school year professional development was conducted in  professional learning cycles that will focused on using Universal Design for Learning.  For the  2018-2019 school year, professional learning will deepen the work around UDL. Students will  be challenged to use higher order thinking skills in their FOSS Investigations and learning.  It is  imperative that the students have access to engaging learning experiences.   By continuing this  work, the PLC will study the different learning modalities (UDL):  Principal 1 - to Provide  Multiple Means of Representation (the "what" of learning) which supports the students in  becoming resourceful and knowledgeable learners, Principal II - Provide Multiple Means of  Action and Expression (the "how" of learning) where students are strategic and goal-directed  learners, and Principal III - Provides Multiple Means of Engagement (the "why" of learning)  where students are purposeful and motivated learners.   Teachers will learn how to strategically  use all UDL principals in order to support the FOSS Investigations and learning.  The work  around Principal III is critically important for all students.  Our work with Quality Teaching for  English Language Learners Q-TEL emphasizes the impact of engagement on student learning  especially ENL students:  "Elementary school is the time to develop the base so that they can  keep learning and contributing through life.  This is the time when they develop their deep and  generative knowledge and skills, their natural curiosity, their agency, autonomy, and voice", as  expressed by Dr. Aida Walqui.  Our ENL students will participate in activities that are  meaningful, and are perceived as valuable.   Engagement supports sustained interactions which  push and support their language development in their home language and in their new  language.  They will develop practices,simultaneously -- conceptually, analytically and  linguistically.  Hands-on learning provides a multiplicity of authentic opportunities for students  to participate along side their peers with appropriate scaffolds.  This is valuable, of course, for all  students.  For ENL students and ENL students with special needs, this is critically important.    Because teachers have had participated in the 2017-2018 PLC around Universal Design for  Learning, they will serve as leaders in the work in order to support new teachers in this work.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?      In an effort to capture early literacy skills, our school is using the Balanced Literacy approach. In using this methodology, we  utilized a number of formative and periodic benchmark assessments. Formative assessments include informal reading  behavior checklists and conference notes regarding specific individual student reading and writing behaviors.  In alignment to the formative assessments, we also use periodic assessments such as the Fountas and Pinnell benchmark  assessments.  The F & Ps are administered four times across the school year. F & Ps are administered by grade level and each  classroom teacher has a kit. We ask teachers in all TBE and Dual Language classrooms to administer this assessment in Spanish  and English. We want to ensure we capture native literacy skills, and that we understand the second language acquisition of  each student.  Understanding the reading behaviors as outlined by F & P has helped us drive instructional decisions that  include additional read aloud and shared reading periods.  Small group instruction including guided reading are also scheduled   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71      as part of each classrooms' instructional plan.  In addition to the F&Ps, we also use the ELL periodic assessment across grades 3-5. This tool has helped us in developing  language opportunities that reflect components of the NYSESLAT assessment.  In response to the elimination of the spring  administration of the Spanish Reading test, the new Spanish Language assessment will be administered at the beginning of the  school year (BOY) and end of year (EOY).  This assessment provides information about student literacy acquisition in Spanish.   We also use On Demand writing assessments to track writing skills across the school year and across all genres of writing.  Using this type of assessment has helped us refine instruction to meet the needs of struggling writers. This assessment is  administered four times throughout the school year.  As part of these On Demand writing assessments, classroom teachers  administer both pre and post assessments.  Teachers meet in grade teams to analyze and compare the results of pre writing,  post writing and published writing pieces.        2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?             We have a school policy regarding non negotiable assessments. In particular the school policy calls for F & P running records to  be administered four times per year, as well as the On Demand writing assessments that cover all genres of writing.   The systems and structures include a time period for administration, teacher analyzing data, and for submission to the data  team. After the data team receives the assessment summary sheets, an analysis is conducted where we identify patterns and  trends. We sit and collaboratively provide the teacher with feedback and implications for instruction.  The results are  compared throughout the year. The data is used to drive instructional decisions and to suggest and implement modifications  to the curriculum.    A school testing calendar clearly outlines the time period for F & P assessment administration.  Based on the testing calendar,  assessment data is due to the data team at specific time periods throughout the year.   Data is reviewed by the data team to  identify students in the lower grades who are at risk. The students who are identified at risk receive special support services to  develop language acquisition. Additionally, the data is used to differentiate instruction and plan for highly targeted guided  reading groups in K-2.  We track the reading data across the year to ensure that we are monitoring progress and language  development so we can best assist teachers in planning for students in need of remediation.  The data team collects and reviews all classrooms assessments in order to highlight patterns and trends and identify grade  level needs.  Teachers are guided in the process of conducting informal reading inventories during one-to-one conferencing in order to  monitor student decoding, fluency and comprehension between the formal F & P assessment administration periods.  This  practice supports close monitoring of student language acquisition across the five pillars of reading.            3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?    We currently use the ELL Periodic Assessment created by Schoolnet to track our MLL students. In addition to the ELL Periodic  assessment, we also utilize baseline and benchmark assessments throughout the school year to identify and track  performance .  The Math Baseline and Benchmark assessments are available in Spanish.  Through collaboration the classroom  teacher and student make a decision whether a student will demonstrate mathematics skills by testing in either English or  Spanish.  Some students with the support of their teacher decide to test with both booklets (side-by-side model).  The ELL  Periodic Assessment is used to measure progress across the year in specific areas that include: reading, writing, listening and  speaking.  Based on the ELL Periodic assessment, we had identified writing as an area in need of improvement.  Disaggregated  data is available from Schoolnet.  The data provides information of overall mastery and performance as it relates to specific  standards.  The reports have allowed us to compare changes in progress. We use the data to form collaborative inquiry groups   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72      that focus on targeting writing skills.  Student writing performance is monitored across collaborative inquiry cycles throughout  the school year.   Student performance is monitored on specific writing learning targets through formative assessments such  as "on demand writing".         4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    We have a data team that compiles next steps for at-risk students. Students are placed in a program based on their needs.  Some students attend a language development clinic while others are pulled out during the school day for small group  intervention.       5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   We have a SIT and RTI team that meet on a biweekly basis. The team is comprised of special education and bilingual teachers.  Teachers who have academic concerns about particular students are asked to complete a referral form.  Upon receiving  student referrals, the team begins to look at the data submitted by the classroom teacher.  The goal in our team is to ensure  that students receive appropriate interventions as outlined in the NYS Response to Intervention (RTI) guidelines.  A special  education teacher and the general education teacher of the RTI committee gather data.  Classroom teachers provide targeted  support - Tier 1 (Core Instruction with weekly progress monitoring) and Tier 2 (targeted small group support.  Tier 2 students  are identified based on weekly Tier 1 progress monitoring.   Tier 2 intervention is provided in addition to Tier 1  support.  Progress monitoring is conducted weekly/biweekly) before we begin looking at Tier 3 possibilities.  The RTI team  looks at the data and generates clarifying questions that the teacher needs to provide. In addition, a schedule is drafted to  ensure that each team member is able to observe the student in question informally prior to the next meeting.   As Tier 1 and  Tier 2 interventions are provided, members of the RTI team will conduct fidelity checks for the purpose of determining how  closely the intervention or tailored instruction is implemented as per the intervention plan.  The committee draws on multiple  sources of information to examine achievement at the classroom level such as standardized exams, unit tests, teacher  produced exams, and classroom observations. The data is analyzed through a language acquisition lens.  Based on the data,  sometimes the teacher, with the assistance of the RTI committee, designs and implements targeted supplemental supports,  that include Tier 1 intervention in the classroom.  Students are also referred to the Literacy and Math specialist who provide  Tier 2 intervention. The progress is monitored over time and the plan is adjusted when necessary.     When students are not making meaningful progress and continue to show academic concerns, we begin to look at Tier 3  models which may include one to one services, smaller group services and specifically pull out services.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   What is revealed NYSITELL and NYSESLAT is the following:  •     15% of the kindergarten students who were assessed using the NYSITELL scored in the Entering level. 15% scored  Emerging.  The highest percentage was in the Transitioning level at 54%.  15% scored at Expanding and no students scored  Commanding.   •     50% of the first grade students who were assessed using the NYSESLAT scored at the Expanding level.  This was the highest  percentage in the performance levels for that grade.  •     59% of the second grade students who were assessed using the NYSESLAT scored at the Expanding level. This was the  highest percentage in the performance levels for that grade.  •     39% of the third grade students who were assessed using the NYSESLAT scored at the Expanding level. This was the highest  percentage in the performance levels for that grade.  •     52% of the fourth grade students who were assessed using the NYSESLAT scored at the Expanding level.  This was the  highest percentage in the performance levels for that grade.  •     50% of the fifth grade students who were assessed using the NYSESLAT scored at the Expanding level. This was the highest  percentage in the performance levels for that grade.  -   1 newly enrolled grade 4 student scored at the Entering level on the NYSITELL.  -   1 newly enrolled grade 5 student scored at the Emerging level on the NYSITELL.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73         •     40% of the students who were tested using either the NYSITELL or NYSESLAT scored in the Expanding level. With strategic  support, these students have the potential to move into the Commanding performance level and reach English proficiency this  year.                 7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The data is analyzed by the data team. Reports that include item analysis are generated in an effort to ensure that teachers are  targeting needed areas. Meetings are held on a weekly basis where teachers discuss data and student needs.  Teachers make modifications to instruction based on the data. For example, some students will require more small group  work, while others might be able to work independently after a mini lesson.  The data is also used to determine how many  minutes are needed within Dual and TBE classrooms for ENL instruction.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   We do not have a freestanding ENL program.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     There is one TBE class in the school. The students in this grade 5 class remain together throughout the day in one  classroom.  The class is heterogeneous in terms of proficiency levels. Students are taught by a certified bilingual  teacher.  Instruction is provided in their native language and in the second language according to proficiency levels.   A Bilingual Pupil Servicesparaprofessional provides support in small and one-to-one grouping.   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      There are six dual language classes in grades kindergarten through 4. The classes are heterogeneous in terms of  proficiency levels and include English proficient students. Language of instruction is alternated day by day (one day is  English, the next day is Spanish).  The students remain together throughout the day.         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   We have Dual Language and Transitional Bilingual Education Programs at our school.   In the Dual Language Program, the  Home Language Arts is delivered to MLL students through teacher modeling and various activities designed to increase  competencies.  Teachers also implement the workshop model for ENL instruction (shared reading, guided reading, read  alouds. etc). The instructional minutes are delivered based on the CR-Part 154 mandates: Students  that are entering and  emerging receive 360 minutes of ENL instruction (8 periods weekly), transitioning and expanding students receive 180 minutes  of ENL instruction (4 periods weekly) and (4 periods of English Language Arts). Our Dual Language program remains at a  50%/50% rate at all times. Students acquire mastery across two languages and there is no decrease of one language to  enhance the other.  In our TBE program, instruction is provided 50% in their native language and 50% in English and over time it increases in  English and decreases the native language. All students develop fluency in English, the instructional time will increase as  outlined by the CR-Part 154 over time.  As in the Dual Language model, students who require services as per PART 154, will  receive services in small groups in alignment to the mandated number of minutes for each proficiency level.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74             3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   We currently have Dual Language and TBE programs. In addition to our balanced literacy approach to literacy, we are engaged  in  using QTEL (Quality Teaching for English Learners) strategies to deliver instruction utilizing UDL strategies that will ensure  accessibility for all students.  The Dual Language program is a 50/50 language allocation model. Students receive equal instruction across content areas on a  daily basis.  Content area teaching provides opportunities for lessons to take place in the native language and the second  language of instruction. We currently have a one-day-English/one-day-Spanish language program where students can acquire  skills across two languages with the end goal of becoming proficient in two languages.  Our instructional language distribution for our one TBE grade 5 class in the TBE program is 50/50 and eventually 70/30.  The  TBE program has different goals and is geared more towards reaching proficiency in English. This is based on parent choice.  In both the TBE and Dual Language programs teachers deliver instruction through workshop models that provide opportunities  for teachers to use Quality Teaching for English Learners Q-TEL strategies and UDL strategies. The QTEL strategies provide  students with scaffolds that are needed to understand content and to enhance language development.  During the 2017-2018  school year, grades 4 and 5 students received daily instruction in Word Gen.  Word Gen supports students in vocabulary  development.  Students use a variety of texts to engage in word-learning activities and are provided opportunities for  discussion and debate.  Writing tasks are incorporated into the program as well.  UDL strategies are used to foster  independence and to ensure that all students are able to access the lesson being taught across all areas of learning.  Our Reading and Writing workshop model,  FOSS Science, and Social Studies Passport programs are all aligned to the common  core learning standards.  In addition, we use the Speaking and Listening standards to ensure that MLL students receive  opportunities across the day to develop language. All pedagogy are well versed, through professional development to thread  the ELA instructional shifts and CCLS in ELA, to foster language development in order to meet the demands of CCLS.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   Teachers use assessments such as the Spanish Lab upon initial enrollment, ELE which is being replaced with the ELL beginning- of-the year (BOY) and end-of- year (EOY) periodic assessments, Fountas and Pinnell running records in Spanish, Estrellita  benchmark assessments to evaluate students throughout the year. Results are discussed during periodic goals and objectives  meetings with teachers and administration and in other professional meetings where student needs are discussed.          5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    We currently do not have any SIFE students at PS 182.  If we had any students who have had short and/or interrupted  educational experiences, we would identify the current level of performance for the student and support the student in order  to develop a foundation from that level.  For newcomer and developing ENL students, classroom teachers differentiate  instruction based on the needs of the individual student.   During literacy and math instruction, students participate in tiered  activities focusing on improving specific skills.  Students who are classified as entering or emerging receive 360 minutes of ENL  instruction per week.  Transitioning and expanding students receive 180 minutes of ENL instruction.  Students who have  achieved a level of commanding receive 90 minutes of ENL instruction per week for two additional years as former ENL  students.  All services for students in Dual and TBE programs are provided in class during specific blocks throughout the day as  outlined in the teacher's program.  An area of focus for newcomers as well as former students is identified.  Our newcomers have the most intense immersion in  the English language.  We provide those students with a buddy and support them as they develop language and can effectively   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          75      communicate with members of our school community.  Newcomers also need more individualized instruction.  We support  the classroom teacher not only through our ENL professional learning but also with AIS instruction when needed.  Developing  students received differentiated instruction through guided reading and strategy lessons within their classroom.  We are also  expanding the Orton Gillingham program in our school in the lower grades to develop the reading skills of our developing  students.   All students who are in our program receive the testing accommodations of extended time and a separate  location.  Students who also have an IEP can receive other accommodations if they are indicated on their IEPs.            6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?    The instructional strategies and grade level materials that teachers of ELLs –SWDs use are the following:  •     Strategy: Q-TEL strategies to actively engage students using a variety of strategies     •     Strategy:  Reciprocal Teaching for comprehension development  •     Materials - Fundations Phonics Program and Recipe for Reading  •     Materials - Teachers College Units of Study for Reading and Writing  •     Materials - Go Math tiered activities  with Math Exemplar activities  •     Materials – Word Gen Program for vocabulary development which fosters discussion and debate        7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?       Our school uses curricula, and instructional strategies which include highly differentiated approaches as per UDL principals,  and scheduling flexibility to enable MLL-SWD students to meet their IEP goals and obtain language proficiency in Spanish and  English the following ways:  •    Q-TEL (Quality Teaching for English Learners) strategies are used to deliver instruction utilizing UDL strategies that will  ensure accessibility for all students.  Teachers refine their practices to design instruction to meet the needs of MLL-SWD  students in their classroom.  Strategically designed lessons allow for multiple means of representation by providing options for  perception; options for language and various options for maximizing student comprehension.   •     Provide common planning for the general education and special education teacher to plan around the students’ IEP  goals    and language needs.  •     Utilize various instructional models of co-teaching, co-teachers (special education and general education teachers) work  closely together to design coherent instruction that is tailored to meet the needs of MLL/SWD students.   •     Teachers participate in inquiry work in their grade teams, data inquiry teams, and bilingual instructional team where plans  for individual and groups of students are explored and developed according to need.   •     The school leader develops schedules that provide consistent opportunities for teachers to plan during the school day and  during professional development periods  •     The school leader plans for professional development that supports teachers in planning for MLL-SWD students which  include:  Generation Ready Mathematics consultant, Literacy Design Collaborative (LDC) where teachers engage in  Understanding By Design (UBD) backwards design planning.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.   The  targeted intervention programs for MLLs in ELA, math, and other content areas are:  •     In grades kindergarten through fifth grade, a full time Bilingual Pupil Services paraprofessional works in a small group with  students to provide support in ELA, math, and other content areas to ELL students. The teacher works with students in Spanish  and English depending on the students’ English proficiency.  A schedule is developed to support a push-in model.  •     Students in kindergarten through fifth grade also receive Academic Intervention Services through a literacy and math  specialist in a push-in/pull-out program. These services are provided in Spanish and English.  •     ELL students participate in an ENL after school program (10 students per class).  Students who score at entering, emerging   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          76      or transitioning levels on the NYSESLAT receive these services. Students in grades Kindergarten to Second grade participate in  this after school program from  October to January.  Students in grades 3 to 5 participate in the ENL after school from January  to April.   The ESL after school classes are conducted twice a week for 120 minutes.   Data analysis is conducted where implications for instruction are identified.  Teachers plan for highly targeted instruction  which includes appropriate UDL strategies in order to provide multiple entry points to the lessons.  Small group/guided  instruction is provided after each mini lesson for all areas of instruction.   Intervention services are offered in English and  Spanish based on student need and level of ENL proficiency.  During literacy instruction, the students complete tiered activities  where they apply the skill introduced during the mini lesson.  These activities provide scaffolded instruction to meet the  specific needs for our ENL learners.  Tiered activities are also part of our math program.  Students also have the opportunity to  be part of our AIS program which is provided by our speech and AIS teachers.  The teachers focus on language development  using the Orton Gillingham program.  Great Leaps is used to support student fluency.  Teachers address social studies and  science needs through small group instruction and tiered activities that are part of our literacy program.  We must continue to  focus on our entering and emerging students and provide them with the skills they need to become proficient in all areas  across the 5 Pillars of Reading.   We are specifically targeting our entering, emerging and transitioning students to help them develop the skills needed to  improve their reading level.   Classroom teachers also focus on improving individual students skills when they meet with their  guided reading groups and conference with individual students.  Classroom teachers look at student progress with relation to  the F & P running records and on going informal reading inventories.  The goal is for each student to be reading on grade level  by the end of the school year.  All ENL students, current and former, are invited to attend our ENL after school program.  This  after school program meets two days a week after school.  It is another opportunity for the students to improve their language  skills.   Current ENL students also receive ENL test accommodations of time extension, separate location, access to a bilingual  dictionary, simultaneous use of English and the alternate language for all exams except the ELA exam.  Oral translations are  provided where the home language is not available.  Students provide written responses in the home language for all exams  except the ELA exam.   These accommodations are also available for students for two years after they reach the commanding  level on the NYSESLAT.   We will continue to focus on our entering and emerging students by strategically grouping them  during literacy instruction for intensive instruction.  We also use a buddy system within the classrooms where ENL students  work closely with their English Proficient peers to increase their language development.  The targeted intervention for ELA,  math, social studies and science is provided though our AIS/RTI program in grades K - 5.  Non-fiction texts are used to  support social studies and science instruction.          9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Continuing professional development related to Q-TEL strategies will be provided in order to ensure continued successful  implementation across all grade levels especially as it relates to MLL students and MLL-SWD students.  This will increase  language acquisition and student engagement.  The Literacy Design Collaborative (LDC) which was piloted during the 2017- 2018 school year will expand across all grade levels.  This will support the school's initiative to engage in backward design  planning through Understanding By Design (UBD).  This will strengthen instructional planning across all areas of study to  ensure that we are planning with end in mind.  Plans will be closely tied to focus/major standards and progress monitoring  through unit check-ins and end-of-unit performance based assessments.  We also expanded our Dual Language program which  has grown to includes grades K-4.  In addition, the after school program which provides instruction through enrichment and  visual arts will continue.  The grant was provided by the Office of the Arts to work with Society of Educational Arts.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   No programs will be discontinued       11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  We have the following programs available to MLL students:  Title 1 After School (Monday -Thursday)  SEA Visual Arts Program (Monday and Tuesday)  New York City Football Club - Soccer (Monday and Tuesday)   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          77      Period 8 Clubs for enrichment  MLL students are afforded equal access to all school programs.       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.   Materials such as leveled books, text books, and big books are provided in Spanish and English for ELLs.  Supplementary  materials are also used such as multiple visuals including picture cards, math manipulatives,and hands-on-science instruments.  Teachers use technology such as the Smart boards, laptops, and tablets to present lessons and engage students in interactive  games and learning opportunities. Students also use the computer lab in the school to reinforce learning and to work on  projects.  The technology specialist articulates regularly with classroom teachers in order to support classroom  instructions.  The cohesive planning supports our MLL and MLL-SWD students in multiple ways.  Instruction is tailored for their  needs.  The technology teacher is able to provide meaningful feedback to classroom teachers.       13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   The students in the transitional bilingual education program and the Dual Language program receive support in their native  language in the Readers and Writers’ Workshop and during the Math workshop.  Students have materials in Spanish such as  the Estrellita Phonics Program, Spanish word walls, Spanish classroom libraries, and Spanish charts. Students are also given  homework in Spanish.  Dual Language classroom environments are reflective of the DL approach.  Anchor charts and other  scaffolds and supports are displayed in both English and Spanish.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All required services such as SETSS, Speech, and AIS are age and grade appropriate, the curriculum is grade specific and is  supported with curriculum maps, teacher made materials/resources and texts.         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    This school year both schools located in 04M83 and 04M182 offered summer professional development sessions to all  teachers across both schools.  The QTEL PD was planned together in an effort to ensure that resources were available across  the school.  This year we also decided that in an effort to meet the needs of our MLLs, we would share cluster teachers in an  effort to provide a more comprehensive academic program. Currently, we are sharing the music, the visual arts,  technology and the writing teachers.         16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Parents who register students prior to the beginning of school receive information on how they can support their students  during the school year.   We do not currently have activities planned prior to student enrollment to acclimate those students  to their new school environment.  Students who enroll during the school year are invited to participate in our after school  program.   Ms. Martin, school guidance counselor supports the ENL parents as they transition to middle school.  Teachers  provide important information to parents of newly enrolled ENL during Curriculum Night in September.  The Parent  Coordinator is always available to meet with families.  Parents will be invited to the District Welcome Back to School Festival in  September.       17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?     Our school does not offer language electives.       18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          78         d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   The language model that is used in the dual language class is the self-contained model. The students who  have been identified as English proficient (EP) integrate 100% of the time with students identified as  Multi-language learners (MLL).  The core content areas are taught in both English and Spanish, alternating  languages from one day to the next; for example Monday is Spanish, Tuesday is English, and Wednesday  is Spanish etc.  Emergent Literacy is taught in both languages.       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?    Professional development plan for teachers: 2018-2019  •     Grade Level PD - Q-TELL strategies and LDC Collaborative Inquiry / Understanding By Design (UBD) backward design  planning.    •     Grade Level PD in Mathematics based on Number Talks (Generation Ready)  •     Go Math Training (Generation Ready) with Exemplar integration  •     Instructional Expectations & the Common Core Standards PD, and turn key pd related to Next Generation Standards.    Professional development will be provided during Chancellor's Conference Days in September, November and June and on  Monday Professional Development.    The principal provides professional development opportunities during the school day through thoughtful and strategic  planning.    All professional development encompasses the needs of MLL and MLL-SWD students.  The previous year's work of providing a  cycle of training in UDL highlighted the needs of our MLL students.  The work will continue for the current school year.    We do have PDs specifically for teachers working in Dual and TBE programs. The PD plan focuses on targeting areas of needs  based on student population and teacher need.              2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Support given to staff in order to assist MLLs as they transition from elementary to middle school is the following:The school’s  middle school liaison, teachers, parents and students attend meetings, fairs, and open houses to become aware of what each  middle school in the district has to offer. Fifth grade support staff which include teachers, school social worker, and middle  school liaison, meet with students to discuss possible schools that would meet the specific needs and interests of MLL  students. Students receive guidance and materials throughout the middle school choice process.    All teachers receive professional development that is MLL specific during Monday's professional development time (15% of  total hours. Agendas and sign in sheets are kept in order to record time and participants. Teachers of MLLs participate in Dual  Language Workshops, Workshops given by The Department of ELLs (DELLS), and book studies that total 50% of total hours of  professional development.             2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          79      Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Our parent coordinator has established a communication system to meet the needs of our parents.    All teachers are available  to parents during parent engagement time on Tuesday afternoons.  Teachers are also available during parent teachers  conferences which are held three times a year.  These meetings help us to set goals for our students with the parents to assess  language development progress and language proficiency progress.  We provide translation services where necessary to  facilitate meetings with teachers.  Ms. Alexander also provides workshops for our parents in conjunction with our ENL after  school program. Her focus has always been to explain the importance of language development for students to be successful  across all of the content areas in school.  She provides workshops on topics such as preparing your child for the NYS ELA or  Math exams and why it is important for your student to read every night.  All correspondences from the main office are  distributed in English and Spanish. Translation services are available for teachers, through other staff members, for parent  teacher conferences in order to ensure clear communication when a teacher is not able to communicate in a parent's home  language.      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.      Mrs. Quintero, our parent coordinator, conducts meetings and workshops to inform parents about ways they can support their  child's learning.  Several teachers (including Ms. Guiterman and Ms. Alexander) also conduct workshops as part of our goal in  ensuring that parents are well informed and educated.  In addition, we work with partners such as BUBBLES and Generation  Ready who have conducted workshops and will continue working with the school community.   We have conducted workshops on the following topics:  1) Understanding your child's IEP  2) Understanding the NYS ELA and Math exam  3) Daily living skills  4) Understanding the NYSESLAT  5) Literacy - how to help improve your student's reading and writng skills  6) Developing conversation skills in your daily life - talking to your child at home as a way to improve their vocabulary.  7) Getting to know the Common Core State Standards  8) Asthma  9) Mental Health  10) Nutrition  11) Literacy with students and parents  We also translate all documents for the parents so they can understand what is taking place in our school.  When parents  come in to school with questions or concerns about documents, we have staff members available who can speak to parents in  Spanish in order to review and explain documents, procedures or help parents fill out documents correctly.  We also have an  open door policy to address parent needs.  Our principal, Ms. Perez, conducts  meetings at the beginning of the school year to  provide the parents the opportunity to share their concerns about the school.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Yazmin Perez, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          82                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   P.S. 182                                                                              School DBN: 04m182  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
