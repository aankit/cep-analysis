This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Our mission is to promote life-long learning by providing students with the requisite skills and an inherent value for  continued growth. Through a program of challenging academic experiences, Francis Lewis High School encourages  youngsters to reach for ever-increasing expectations. By consistently providing for the intellectual, social and ethical  growth of all students, Francis Lewis High School serves its diverse community.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.

Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   An increasing number of ELLs are entering at the beginning level of proficiency and/or over-age. To ensure level- appropriate instruction, ESL level 1 will continue to be offered in both the fall and spring terms, if needed, despite  annualization. To accelerate communicative language development through increased language exposure and  practice, ESL level 3 (i.e. low-intermediate) will remain three periods of ESL, one period more than mandated. The use  of technology in classroom instruction will be expanded to include Rosetta Stone. Furthermore, NLA coursework will   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      reinforce ESL and content-area coursework through the use of parallel strategies and thematically-paired units  whenever possible. There is an increase in the number of SIFE students who are illiterate in their native language. As a  result, a skills-based literacy class will be established.   Students with IEP’s are provided instruction in the least restrictive environment appropriate for the students’ needs  as assessed by individual subject area. This is determined collaboratively and clearly communicated on the students  IEP. A variety of instructional settings are available, including: 15:1 self-contained, Integrated Team Teaching and  Resource room support. In addition we provide a program for students with severe cognitive deficiencies in a non- credit bearing Alternate Assessment program.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The following are elements of the Framework for Great Schools that we have made great strides in this school year:   Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers. The school learning environment survey reveals that FLHS has established  a support/positive environment in which instruction can take place. Students, parents and teachers expressed that  they feel safe and supported.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Francis Lewis works with many outside community based organizations, for example Judge Song the President of the  International Criminal Court was invited and accepted an invitation to speak to our students about global human  rights. This event was coordinated by our relationship with the Korean Parents Association.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in  school and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators  value each other. This year we ran an SBO to adjust the school day next year to allow for more time to do teacher  inquiry teams, Professional Development, Tutoring and other professional work, due to the trust that the  administration has with the faculty the SBO passed by a margin of 196-8.   The following areas from the Framework for Great Schools will be our focus for this coming school year 2018-19:   Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement. Extensive PD structures have been in place that supported teacher practice through both formal PD  days and an ongoing series of workshops led by instructional coach, administration and teachers. Teacher driven  collaborative inquiry had taken a less formal approach due to the lack of a specific structure to allow for ongoing  collaboration in a formal setting. For the 2017-18 school year this has been addressed by an SBO and weekly  collaborative meetings will take place. Thoughtful programming of teachers will allow teachers who teach similar  subjects the common planning time to work together.   Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High  standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing  critical thinking skills. The foundation for rigorous/engaging instruction begins with the knowledge of where students  are and a clear understanding of where we would like them to end up. We have recently implemented a new  assessment and engagement tool that will give the teachers instant information about student learning. This data will  be paired with intensive professional development to train teacher on how to use this information to drive  instructional decisions and increase student understanding.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 26Q430   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   4557   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   YES   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     The most recent PPO visit showed an inconsistency in the level of rigor observed during classroom lessons. In  particular it stated:   “In classrooms visited, instruction was typically teacher centered, students did not consistently engage in higher order  discussion and tasks didn’t consistently reflect high levels of student thinking and participation. During our classroom  debriefing session we agreed that 4/6 classes observed were developing. .” The most recent Quality review stated:  Other responses included, “I wrote about Francis Lewis cause I’m glad I came here. I made friends and cool people  here.” Across classrooms, teaching practices are beginning to reflect a set of beliefs about how students learn. Across  classrooms, student work products and discussion reflect uneven levels of rigor. Although the school has a set beliefs  about how students learn best, the implementation of this belief is inconsistent across classrooms resulting in missed  opportunities to engage student thinking and participation at high levels.”   During the evaluation process of the 2017-18 school year, 3b Questioning and Discussion was the lowest rated  instructional component, with 26% receiving a developing or ineffective rating. The average rating for 3b was 2.86 out  of 4 which equates to a 72%.   Francis Lewis High School has over 233 teachers; there are many shining examples of rigorous instructional activities  and deep thoughtful discussions filled with critical thinking taking place. We will be utilizing our internal strengths to  model best practices as move toward a more consistent, uniform understanding and delivery of rigorous and  engaging instruction.

In the most recent Quality Review (2016-17) the following was noted in section 1.2 Pedagogy: “Although the school  has a set of beliefs about how students learn best, the implementation of this belief is inconsistent across classrooms  resulting in missed opportunities to engage student thinking and participation at high levels.” This resulted in an  overall rating of Developing in pedagogy. In 2017-18 four teachers were rated Developing or Ineffective in the  Methods of Teacher Practice (MOTP). In order for students to achieve their educational goals , it is imperative that  effective instruction be delivered in all classrooms.

The most recent Quality Review and PPO visits reveled that although teachers are engaged in collaborative work the,  “….clear next steps for the teacher teams based on student needs were not evidenced as a consistent practice.” It also  suggests that the output of the inquiry work is not filtering down into changes in pedagogical practices in a consistent  and logical manner. Much of the work this year in reference to teacher teams has been focused on collaborating on  common assessments and analyzing the assessments to inform curricular changes. Next year we will focus on looking  at student work particularly for the Lowest Third in order to make instructional changes that will lead to increased  student achievement. The focus on the Lowest Third students is derived from the most recent data on the 2015-16  School Quality Guide which showed that there was a 37% point drop in the percentage of students graduating in four  years between the general population and the Lowest Third in City.   Teachers at Francis Lewis High School have been engaging in collaborative inquiry teams during a dedicated period  each week, this was negotiated through the School Based Option (SBO) process The culture of inquiry and  collaboration exists and is healthy. In the action plan below I will describe the steps that we will take in order to yield  more useful results from these collaborations.

The most recent Quality Review stated, "Across classrooms, teaching practices are beginning to reflect a set of beliefs  about how students learn. Across classrooms, student work products and discussion reflect uneven levels of rigor.  Impact Although the school has a set beliefs about how students learn best, the implementation of this belief is  inconsistent across classrooms resulting in missed opportunities to engage student thinking and participation at high  levels."    The Advance Observation tool has identified 3b as the area most needed to focus in pedagogically.   By encouraging and cultivating a distributed leadership mindset teachers will take ownership over professional  development and monitoring their own growth. Peer inter-visitation and frequent instructional "walk throughs" will  provide teachers additional support and a platform for instructional conversation and reflection about best practices.            Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33      each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34        Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Francis Lewis HS, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the  Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The Francis  Lewis’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.

The  Francis Lewis community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent  involvement policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of our school. The findings of the evaluation  through school surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of  parents, and enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the Francis Lewis.             Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  Francis Lewis Parent Teacher Association, as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted  on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input. To increase  and improve parent involvement and school quality, Francis Lewis will:      ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title I  Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;      ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to schools to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;      ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in our Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;      ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

Fluency in academic language is necessary for  mastery of content as it is the foundation for comprehension.  However, ELLs must  simultaneously acquire both.  Accelerating the simultaneous acquisition through thematically- paired ENL and content area instruction, the Title III Saturday program offers 20 weeks of  supplemental instruction in ENL, science, math, and social studies to ELLs in grades 9-12.  As noted in Diverse Learners on the Road to Success: The Performance of New York City’s  English Language Learners (Office of English Language Learners, 2009), by targeting supports  and focusing on the development of academic language and literacy, schools can “unlock” ELLs’  potential.  A review of research documented in The Teaching of Language Arts to Limited  English Proficient/English Language Learners: A Resource Guide for All Teachers (New York  State Education Department: Office of Bilingual Education) reveals “proficiency in a second  language can best be developed when it is allowed to emerge holistically and naturally through  the use of functional language for authentic purposes” (Hamayan 1993).   The authors assert that,  “In order to ensure that second language learners do not fall behind their monolingual peers, it is  now expected that the ENL professionals incorporate content  in their instruction, i.e. using  authentic English literature, science experiments, historical documents, problem solving, etc.,  into planning and instruction.”  To further support their assertion, they point to research conducted by O’Malley and Valdez- Pierce (1996) who noted, "...what second language educators have overtly recognized is that the  language of each content area has special concepts, vocabulary, and language functions that  require unique forms of instruction in which language and content are integrated.  As part of this  instruction, students should have opportunities to learn and apply concepts in the content areas  through all four language skills.  Research has shown that appropriate content instruction  facilitates language learning.  With research as the cornerstone of the program and data driving instruction, the Title III classes  are collaboratively planned by ten fully certified ENL, content, and bilingual teachers ( 3 ENL; 1  English; 1 Social Studies; 1 Living Environment; 1 Math;  3 bilingual) and 1 Guidance  Counselor. As no other programs will be operating in the building during the hours of Title III  program, an Assistant Principal/supervisor will also be present. The presence of a supervisor will  ensure high quality instruction and efficient implementation of the program. Furthermore, a  supervisor will allow prompt and appropriate DOE policy aligned guidance to any unforeseen  emergencies.   Attendance will be taken in each class by the classroom teacher and the AP Supervision will  keep important records such as attendance and correspondence with parents in a Title III file in  the ENL department office (room 211).   Student placement is dependent on language proficiency, subject knowledge and students'  need.  State-generated performance data, course performance data and students' requests indicate   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44      Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   the need for supplemental content-based language instruction in American and Global History,  Living Environment, English, and Math. Hence, these are the classes offered in conjunction with  ENL instruction.  ENL instruction will target, but not be exclusive to, both newcomers and long- term ELLs.   To support continuous participation in the Title III program and accelerate students' academic  progress, a guidance counselor collaboratively with the other faculty members, will run four  parent workshops that are each three hours long . The workshops will have interpreters available  on site to assist parents in their preferred languages of communication.  In addition, to promote  college readiness, the guidance counselor will offer direct supplemental instruction in college  and career readiness skills. Parents will be notified of the parent workshops through letters in  their preferred languages of communication.  As Douglas Barnes stated, “Education should strive not for the acceptance of one voice, but for  the exploration of many voices.”  To that end, the supplemental instruction includes  performance, culture and technology components designed to help ELLs, particularly newcomers  and long-term, to “find” and express their voices.  Teachers provide culturally-diverse, video- based and computer-aided instruction to ELLs.  Instruction is exclusive to Title III ELLs and  supported by the integration of authentic materials such as Scholastic, Scope, Upfront, Newsday,  Daily News, N.Y. Times, National Geographic, Channel Thirteen Video libraries, Rosetta Stone,  and Internet research in the ENL computer lab.  Performance components include but are not  limited to student-created speeches, debates, argument writing, lab reports, current events  reporting, and video clips.  Portfolios will highlight student work.  To enhance instruction and increase students’ accountability,  the ENL computer lab will be used  for students to review and revise their peers’ work with teachers acting as facilitators.  For this  purpose, additional laptops, headphones, memory sticks, maps and assorted  supplies will be  purchased.   As language and culture are intertwined, instruction explores both elements and is supported by  educational and cultural excursions with pre- and post-study designed to enrich students’  language development.  Proposed excursions include but are not limited to: The Museum of the  Moving Image, The Sands Point Preserve, The American Museum of Natural History, The  Metropolitan Museum of Art, The New York Botanical Garden, and TBD Broadway Show.  The program will run on Saturdays from October 13, 2018 to June 8, 2019.   Students have the  option of choosing 2 classes from the ones offered. The first class is from 8:30am - 10:25am; the  second, from 10:40am - 12:30pm.  The following classes are offered:  ENL Entering--This class will focus on the development of oral skills through units of study on  identity, immigration, and current events that promote discussion and academic language  development.        ENL Emerging--This class will focus on interpreting and responding to texts and the developing  reading strategies (i.e. annotating, inferencing, predicting) across disciplines.  ENL Expanding --This will be a co-teaching class focused on argumentative writing and debate.  Living Environment--This class will focus on conducting and documenting scientific  experiments in written investigative reports.  Global Studies --This class will focus on current events with a World Wide impact as well as  analysis of primary sources including political cartoons and editorials, and DBQ and thematic  essay writing.  US History and Government--This class will focus on U.S. history and current events as well as  analysis of primary sources including political cartoons and editorials, and DBQ and thematic  essay writing.  Math--This class will integrate interpretation of word problems and verbal and written  explanation of the steps involved in problem-solving.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   Each class will consist of a maximum of 1:20 teacher-to-student ratio.  English will be used as  the primary language of instruction. However, bilingual teachers will also be present in content  area classrooms to provide home language support.     To facilitate instruction and serve the needs of ELLs in the Transitional Bilingual Program and  ELLs requesting bilingual services, a bilingual language teacher will co-teach lessons with the  Living Environment, Social Studies, and Math teachers by providing translation, small group  instruction and one-to-one tutoring as needed for home language support.   The following materials are used for instructional support:  Title III resource (supplemental):  Prentice Hall Brief Review: Global History and Geography  Prentice Hall Brief Review: United Stated History and Government  School resource:  A Short History of the United States, Chinese Edition  A Child's History of the World, Chinese Edition  Physics: Principles and Problems, Chinese Edition  Parents will be notified of available programs by letters in the preferred languages of  communication. The letters in top three preferred languages (Chinese, Spanish, and Korean) will  be translated in-house by the certified ENL and WL teachers. Additional letters in remaining  preferred languages will be translated through the Translation and Interpretation Unit. In  addition, parents will receive phone calls with the same information in English, Chinese, Korean,  and Spanish. Information on available programs and other important announcements will also be  made available on the school website and on the dedicated ENL-WL site.

The 2006 ELLs in  New York City: Student Demographic Data Report (Summer, 2006) notes that “more than 40%  percent of all NYC students report speaking a language other than English at home.”  To  enhance the quality of the instruction provided to ELLs, the ten teachers will participate in 15  hours of Professional Development conducted by an Assistant Principal. The workshops will  implement an empirically validated framework for teaching both academic content and language  skills for English Learners and  promote understanding of specific considerations for ELLs,  preparing all students for college and careers.

These meetings are supplemental to the regular school-wide orientation meetings  already scheduled for parents of all students.  Topics covered include ways for parents to support  students enrolled in the program in various academic needs. For example, workshop #2 will  familiarize parents with the college admission process. As a result, parents can hold meaningful  conversations about college admission. They can provide guidance and help their child manage  the admission process to stay on track. Moreover, the remaining workshops will equip parents  with tools necessary to provide additional support in core subjects.  The workshops will be held on Saturdays but this can be adjusted to weeknights to accommodate  parents' schedules. The meetings will be conducted by the school based certified guidance  counselor  and cover the following topics:  Parent Workshop #1 - October 6, 2018 from 9 a.m. to noon (3 hours)  Orientation to the Title III Program--an in-depth look at the Title III Program (i.e. courses of  study, requirements, expectations, technology, parental involvement, and academic counseling)  and academic opportunities.  Parent Workshop #2 - November 3, 2018 from 9 a.m. to noon (3 hours)  The College Bound Student--A discussion of the process of college preparation and admission.  Topics such as study skills, application, essay writing, responding to questionnaires, and  interviewing are addressed.   Parent Workshop #3 -  January 12, from 9 a.m. to noon (3 hours)  Interdisciplinary Strategies--A workshop on best practices for parents to support student progress  in ENL, Math, Science and Social Studies.  Topics include using technology, note-taking, word  work, study skills, and parent-student and parent-teacher conferencing.  Parent Workshop #4 - June 8, 2019 from 10 a.m. to 12:30 (2.5 hours)  Stories of Success—An exhibition of student successes (samples of work) and a forum to  provide suggestions for improvement.  Parents will sign-in for each workshop to keep a record of attendance. These attendance sheets  along with agendas and copies of parent invitation letters will be kept in the Tittle III folder in  the ENL office. A digital copy of each item will also be stored in the Title III folder on the  school network.  In addition to translated letters sent to parents, parent workshop information will also be posted  on the ENL website, ELL parent bulletin board, and the Parent Coordinator's Weekly.  To  promote parent engagement of all parents, interpreters will be available on the days of the  workshop to facilitate communication in the preferred languages.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47   Part E: Budget   FOR SCHOOLS NOT CONCEPTUALLY CONSOLIDATED ONLY.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Across departments, instructional planning is informed by teacher-created common assessments and midyear examinations  aligned to the CCLS and designed in teacher teams under the guidance of the Assistant Principals of Supervision. Technology  based assessments, such as Achieve 3000, System 44, and Read 180, continuously adjust contents as per student performance.  In addition, to further support the FLHS writing initiative to advance academic language, Vocabulary.com assessments are  implemented regularly. All assessments are reviewed for appropriate rigor and validity by the Assistant Principals of  Supervision.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50         Purposeful teacher team design (including inter-departmental) allows for critical/task analysis of performance data which, in  turn, informs revision and instruction.  Common preparation/planning periods allow for additional dedicated time.  Inquiry- based weekly teacher team meetings focus on analysis of student work products and performance assessments. In addition,  input from the Language Proficiency Team is provided. Development of curriculum-embedded assessments is conducted  throughout the year and in the summer, with on-going professional development in the creation of valid assessments and the  use of data to inform instruction offered through the department and the FLHS UFT Teacher Center.   In addition, FLHS offers opportunities for teachers to attend external professional learning series, who then conduct turn-key  training to their respective departments. Insights from analysis of data informed the choice of school-wide instructional focus,  which has been reflection and feedback with an emphasis on writing. Creation of the UFT Teacher Center to support on-going  professional development in teaching and assessment of writing was prompted by findings through teacher-team meetings  and analysis of data.        3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  FLHS teacher-created benchmark assessments across content areas identify baseline, progress, and areas of need.  Curriculum- embedded performance tasks are administered at the end of each unit of study.  Common mid-year examinations are also  administered across departments.        4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Teacher teams analyze student work products throughout the intervention process to determine the effectiveness prior to  summative assessments.  Interventions include targeted small group instruction, differentiation in content, process, and  product as per team findings. Summative performance data is used to further refine instructional strategies. Each year  summer curriculum writing draws upon summative data to guide curriculum development and adjustment.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Not applicable to high school (9-12).     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   ELL performance data from the ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT), RLAT, regents examinations across content-areas is analyzed by  teacher teams within each department. Task analysis informs curricular, programmatic, and instructional changes. For  example, in the past, analysis of the performance data led to the creation of public speaking course for intermediate level  ELLs to develop verbal fluency. NYSESLAT performance data for 2016-2017 analyzed through EDAT confirmed speaking as a  "modality of strength" after the integration of Public Speaking. Overall, more than 65% of students who took the  NYSESLAT scored high in the speaking modality. This year, drama will serve as a continuance to public speaking to incorporate  fiction and literary response. In addition, in accordance with school-wide focus on writing, there was a 19% improvement in  ELL performance on the written response sections of the Common Core English Regents. Furthermore, to address the social  needs, there is integration of life/survival skills in the beginning and intermediate level courses.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Findings are disseminated by the Assistant Principals of Supervision and serve as the the focus of ELL-dedicated department  meetings, teacher team meetings, and PD.  In addition, ELL performance data is available for teacher reference on the FLHS  public drive to which administrators and teachers have ready access.

How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   ENL instruction is provided by either a single dually-certified ENL /ELA teacher or by a team of two individually  certified teachers, one in ELA and one in ENL.    At all levels of the Freestanding ENL program, ELLs are provided with ENL instruction in accordance with CR Part  154.2:    Entering: Two periods of Integrated ENL in ELA and one period of Stand-Alone ENL a day for five days a week;  Emerging and Transitioning: One period of Integrated ENL in ELA and one period of Stand-Alone ENL a day for five  days a week;  Expanding: One period of Integrated ENL in ELA a day for five days a week;  Commanding: One period of Integrated ENL in ELA a day for five days a week for an additional two years.    Total number of ENL units of study exceed mandated minutes.    Grouping is ungraded but homogeneous by English proficiency level as determined by the NYSESLAT or NYSITELL with  the exception of Advanced ELLs who are enrolled in grade-level integrated English courses at a 50/50 ratio of ELLs to  native speakers of English.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     ENL instruction is provided by either a single dually-certified ENL /ELA teacher or by a team of two individually  certified teachers, one in ELA and one in ENL.    At all levels of the Transitional Bilingual Education program, ELLs are provided with ENL instruction in accordance with  CR Part 154.2:    Entering: Two periods of Integrated ENL in ELA, one period of Stand-Alone ENL a day for five days a week, and one  period of Home Language Arts (HLA) in Chinese;  Emerging and Transitioning: One period of Integrated ENL in ELA, one period of Stand-Alone ENL a day for five days a  week, and one period of HLA in Chinese;  Expanding: One period of Integrated ENL in ELA a day for five days a week and one period of HLA in Chinese;  Commanding: One period of Integrated ENL in ELA a day for five days a week for an additional two years and one  period of HLA in Chinese.    Total number of ENL units of study exceed mandated minutes.    Grouping is ungraded but homogeneous by English proficiency level within a level as determined by the NYSESLAT or  NYSITELL with the exception of Advanced ELLs who are enrolled in grade-level integrated English courses at a 50/50  ratio of ELLs to native speakers of English.    The content areas offered in the Chinese Bilingual Program are Math, Science, and Social Studies.   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Not applicable.      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   At all levels of the Freestanding ENL program, ELLs are provided with language instruction in accordance with CR Part 154.2:    Entering: Two periods of Integrated ENL in ELA and one period of Stand-Alone ENL a day for five days a week;  Emerging and Transitioning: One period of Integrated ENL in ELA and one period of Stand-Alone ENL a day for five days a  week;  Expanding: One period of Integrated ENL in ELA a day for five days a week;  Commanding: One period of Integrated ENL in ELA  a day for five days a week for an additional two years.    Total number of ENL units of study exceed mandated minutes.    ENL instruction is provided by either a single dually-certified ESOL /ELA teacher or by a team of two individually certified  teachers, one in ELA and one in ESOL.    At all levels of the Transitional Bilingual Education program, ELLs are provided with language instruction in accordance with CR  Part 154.2:  Entering: Two periods of Integrated ENL in ELA, one period of Stand-Alone ENL a day for five days a week, and one period of  Home Language Arts (HLA) in Chinese;  Emerging and Transitioning: One period of Integrated ENL in ELA, one period of Stand-Alone ENL a day for five days a week,  and one period of HLA in Chinese;  Expanding: One period of Integrated ENL in ELA a day for five days a week and one period of HLA in Chinese;  Commanding: One period of Integrated ENL in ELA a day for five days a week for an additional two years and one period of  HLA in Chinese.    Total number of ENL units of study exceed mandated minutes.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   To make content comprehensible and to enrich language development, SIOP aligned instruction is scaffolded in all ENL, HLA,  bilingual and content-area courses with a dual focus on the development of communicative and academic  language.   Instruction incorporates, for example, the use of technology (e.g. smartboard), media (e.g. CNN and National  Geographic), realia (e.g. historical documents, artwork, models), flexible grouping (e.g. grouping by proficiency level, interest,  or opinion), graphic organizers (e.g. t-charts) and alternative assessments (e.g. portfolios, project-based  learning).   Furthermore, materials are varied to appeal to the different learning styles and needs of our ELL population.  In  addition, the ENL department uses a variety of authentic materials and content-rich ENL texts (e.g. Shining Star and  Milestones) which incorporate both fiction and non-fiction.  In the selection of materials and resources, age-appropriate,  student-centered and high-interest content is the focus. Achieve 3000, Rosetta Stone, Vocabulary.com, Read 180 and System  44 also support ENL instruction.  Curricula, instruction, and assessment align with the content area standards, New Language  Arts Progressions and Home Language Progressions (as derived from the Common Core Learning Standards).            In the Bilingual Program, instruction is delivered in appropriate ratios of Chinese and English as per CR Part 154.2       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   ELE and CRT results and patterns are shared with teachers in the Bilingual Program to inform instruction.  In-class HLA  assessments are evaluated by Jacqueline Irving-Mongui, AP ENL and World Languages.  Assessments and rubrics in bilingual  classes are prepared in both English and the home language.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Differentiation for all ELL subgroups occurs at the classroom level in process, content, product and learning environment.  For process, ELLs use tiered activities with varying scaffolds and levels of complexity to support understanding and skill  development.   With regard to content, texts, materials and resources on the same topics are offered at various levels of  language complexity and in bilingual classes may be offered in both the home language and English.  With regard to  product,  students are provided with options to demonstrate their learning.  With regard to the learning environment, choices  of independent, pair and small group organizations are offered.  Test accommodations for ELLs and former ELLs (up to two  years after determination of proficiency)--extended time, simultaneous use of the English and translated exam (as allowable),  separate location, use of a word-to-word dictionary, and word-to-word translation (as allowable)--are provided.    Teachers utilize flexible grouping to maximize learning by building on students' strengths.    Additional differentiation is also offered beyond the classroom as outlined below:    a. SIFE          For SIFE to be afforded the most appropriate education, the cornerstone is identification.  Using the criteria established by  the Department of Education and outlined in The ELL Policy and Reference Guide 2017-18 , the NYSITELL Coordinator with the  assistance of an HLA teacher or bilingual ENL teacher and ELL guidance counselor carefully screens each new student to  determine whether or not he or she is SIFE, conducting oral interviews of the parent and student in the preferred language of  communication and English, a thorough review of the student’s academic records, and using the Literacy Evaluation for  Newcomer SIFE if appropriate.    If it is determined that the student is, in fact, SIFE, he/she will be offered supplemental  instruction in the Title III program to assist him or her in attaining at or above grade level performance in all subjects.  The  program is designed to supplement content area instruction and accelerate academic and communicative language  development.             To activate and build on students’ prior knowledge, all ELL instruction includes the study of learning strategies, particularly  pre-reading, reading (e.g. using contextual clues, predicting, and graphically representing information) and writing  strategies.  In addition, topics such as study skills, note-taking, time management, and test-taking strategies are covered in  detail to acclimate students to the academic environment and empower them with the skills needed for success in school.            One-to-one tutoring is strongly encouraged and offered in both English and the home language whenever possible,  including thorough the PAL program (peer assistance).  In addition, home language arts (HLA) instruction is provided if  available.  Through a collaborative effort, ENL and HLA teachers deliver coordinated/parallel instruction to promote  simultaneous development in both languages.    b. Newcomers    To encourage a comfortable and successful transition for all new immigrants, newcomer orientations are offered throughout  the year to ELLs and their families.  The orientations include: a school tour, review of student schedules and the school  calendar, overview of sequence and scope of courses with grade promotion and graduation requirements, availability of  support services and supplemental programs, advisement scheduling, and team and club offerings.   ELLs also receive a  WelcomeBack Pack with school supplies, including bilingual dictionaries.    ELLs and their parents and/or guardians are provided with school information through multiple avenues (e.g. open school  night, PTA meetings, student orientation meetings, the school website) and in multiple languages.    Newcomers are also given the opportunity to attend intensive supplementary ENL courses on Saturday funded through Title  III.  In addition to language instruction, the courses offer cultural studies and excursions that support academic and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      communicative language development.     Furthermore, ELLs at the beginning and intermediate levels of proficiency in English will find all ENL courses available in both  the fall and spring terms despite annualization of courses.  This also permits newcomers to continue in the level, if needed,  beyond the single term, affording the students the most appropriate instruction.  In constant communication, ENL pedagogues, the AP of ENL/World Language, and the dedicated guidance counselors closely  monitor the progress of newcomers and work collaboratively to effectively address any issues that arise.    c. Developing ELLs    To ensure continued progress,  ENL content-area courses are offered as part of the freestanding-ENL program. PALs provide  supplemental assistance to promote understanding of the material. Public-speaking and Drama courses facilitate verbal  fluency.     d.  Long-term ELLs            Long-term ELLs may be coping with issues beyond academic, requiring a sensitive and comprehensive approach.   The  student, his or her parents/guardians, guidance counselors, teachers and the appropriate Assistant Principal(s) confer to  accurately identify and address each need.  Appropriate steps—counseling, tutoring, and/or enrollment in  additional/supplementary classes and/or alternative placement in evening programs or ISS—are then taken.    e.  Former ELLs    All former ELLs are provided with up to two years of transitional support.  This includes ENL integrated instruction.  In addition,  Title III supplemental instruction, designed to reinforce, clarify, and amplify the instruction in regular English courses.  Students  are also offered teacher-led or peer tutoring. If appropriate, academic intervention services (additional instructional periods  through Circular 6) will be provided.  Furthermore, if the parental program selection was bilingual, the students receive up to  two additional years of bilingual content-area instruction if desired.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   To make content comprehensible and to enrich language development, instruction is scaffolded in all ENL courses with a dual  focus on the development of communicative and academic language.  Instruction incorporates the use of technology (e.g.  System 44, Achieve 3000, Read 180, Rosetta Stone/Smartboard), media, realia, grouping, graphic organizers and alternative  assessment.  Furthermore, materials are varied to appeal to the different learning styles and needs of our ELL population.  Literature selections include more than 450 titles from Shakespeare to Khaled Hosseini. Non-fiction works include historical  documents and current event periodicals. As available, bilingual editions of text are also utilized. Examples of instructional  strategies include role-play, comparison/contrast and discussion.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  To enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals, the ISS, ENL and guidance departments work closely together.  Close monitoring  of student academic performance, behavior, and attendance is conducted by the appropriate personnel (AP ISS, AP ENL,  Guidance counselors and classroom teachers). All diploma bound SWDs who are cross-identified as ELLs are placed in the least  restrictive environment--mainstream ENL courses, general education and/or ICT English classes. ELLs/SWDs participate are  afforded access to all programs (including Title III).  As per student needs, FLHS currently offers self-contained, ICT and  mainstream classes for ELLs/SWDs throughout the school day.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      To promote college and career readiness, ELLs are offered explicit instruction/coursework in public speaking, argumentative  writing, research, use of technology and the opportunity to join Virtual Enterprise.  Coursework promotes the development of  critical thinking/analytical/argument skills.     Common-core aligned HLA instruction is provided in Chinese, Spanish and Korean, the three main home languages of the ELL  population, to facilitate the development and transfer of language skills.  Instruction is content-based to accelerate acquisition  of content knowledge.    A Title III Saturday program offers additional support to all ELLs—current, former, long-term, SIFE, and SWDs—with language  and content area courses offered.  At all proficiency levels, English Language Learners (ELLs) are faced with the two-fold  challenge of academic language and content.  Fluency in academic language is necessary for mastery of content as it is the  foundation for comprehension.  However, ELLs must simultaneously acquire both.  Accelerating the simultaneous acquisition  through thematically-paired ENL and content area instruction, the Title III Saturday program offers 24 weeks of supplemental  instruction in ENL, ELA, math, science, and social studies.  It focuses on increasing content knowledge and accelerating the  development of ELLs’ analytical, writing and test-taking skills.     As noted in Diverse Learners on the Road to Success: The Performance of New York City’s English Language Learners (Office of  English Language Learners, 2009), by targeting supports and focusing on the development of academic language and literacy,  schools can “unlock” ELLs’ potential.  A review of research documented in The Teaching of Language Arts to Limited English  Proficient/English Language Learners: A Resource Guide for All Teachers (New York State Education Department: Office of  Bilingual Education) reveals “proficiency in a second language can best be developed when it is allowed to emerge holistically  and naturally through the use of functional language for authentic purposes” (Hamayan 1993).   The authors assert that, “In  order to ensure that second language learners do not fall behind their monolingual peers, it is now expected that the ENL  professional incorporate content-area material, i.e. authentic English literature, science experiments, historical documents,  problem solving, etc., into planning and instruction.”    With research as the cornerstone of the program and data driving instruction, the Title III classes are collaboratively planned  by seven fully certified and licensed ENL, HLA and content-area teachers under the supervision of a coordinator.  Student  placement is dependent on language proficiency, subject knowledge and student need.  State-generated performance data,  course performance data and student requests indicate the need for supplemental content-based language instruction in  American and Global History, Living Environment, Algebra and Geometry.  Hence, these are the classes offered in conjunction  with ENL instruction.  ENL instruction will target, but not be exclusive to, both newcomers and long-term ELLs.  Students in the  Saturday program have the opportunity to attend both a content-area and an ENL course.    To facilitate instruction and serve the needs of ELLs in the Transitional Bilingual Program and ELLs requesting bilingual services,  a licensed Chinese teacher co-teaches lessons in the Title III program, providing HLA support in small group instruction and  one-to-one tutoring as needed.     To support continuous participation in the Title III program and accelerate academic progress, guidance counseling is  offered.  One bilingual guidance counselor addresses the needs of ELLs on an on-going basis for the entire twenty-five weeks of  the program for a total of 66 hours, 6 of which are dedicated to parent workshops.  One-on-one conferencing and reviews of  transcripts (course and regents grades), teacher evaluations/referrals, NYSESLAT scores and student questionnaires are  conducted to aid in identifying specific areas of concern for ELLs.      As Douglas Barnes stated, “Education should strive not for the acceptance of one voice, but for the exploration of many  voices.”  To that end, the supplemental instruction includes performance, culture and technology components designed to  help ELLs, particularly newcomers and long-term, to “find” and express their voices.  Teachers provide culturally-diverse,  video-based and computer-aided instruction to ELLs.  Instruction is exclusive to Title III ELLs, supervised by a coordinator and  reinforced using Rosetta Stone and Scholastic in the designated ENL computer lab.  Performance components include but are  not limited to student-created one-act plays, speech making, poetry recitals and video clips.  Portfolios highlight student work.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      As language and culture are intertwined, instruction explores both elements and is supported by educational and cultural  excursions with pre- and post-study designed to enrich students’ language development.  Proposed excursions include but are  not limited to: The Museum of the Moving Image, The Sands Point Preserve, The American Museum of Natural History, The  Metropolitan Museum of Art, The New York Botanical Garden, and TBD Broadway show.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      As an extension of Public Speaking, Drama will be offered to ELLs at the intermediate levels to deepen understanding of verbal  and non-verbal communication and literary analysis, areas of need indicated by student questionnaire responses. Teacher  narrative data demonstrated an increase in student confidence and fluency in whole class discussion as a direct result of  completion of the Public Speaking course.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   Not applicable.      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are afforded equal opportunities and accessibility to appropriate instruction and resources through programming based  on student need, through NYSITELL and/or NYSESLAT results as well as academic performance, and parent choice.  Counselors  address ELLs’ academic, social and emotional concerns through advisement.  To build a relationship from the start, counselors  meet individually with all ninth-grade ELLs to set and discuss progress towards academic and personal goals. In addition, there  are dedicated bilingual college counselors to assist in the college selection and application process.    An ELL Welcome and Information Center located within the ENL department office serves to familiarize incoming and current  students and their parents with the Language Allocation Policy, ENL curriculum and instruction, city and state assessments,  and supplemental educational opportunities (e.g. Title III) as well as address any concerns or questions they may have.  New  admits receive a WelcomeBack Pack that contains needed school supplies.    The Peer Advocate Liaison (PAL) program serves to ease the period of transition for newly-admitted ELLs by providing supports  crucial to their success.  It pairs new admits with informed and academically successful classmates—former ELLs, whenever  possible—who help ELLs navigate their new environment.  To overcome language barriers, new admits may be paired with  PALs who speak the same native language.  With the opportunity to earn service credit, the “PALs” assist the new admits with  building organization and procedures. Examples of tasks include locating classrooms and important offices, and obtaining gym  uniforms, student ids, metrocards and lunch cards.   A resource for the newcomers, the PAL program also offers opportunities  for informal but real exchanges in the target language—English.     ELLs are members of all programs offered at FLHS, including our specialized programs, extracurricular offerings and Title III  Saturday supplemental instruction.  Invitations are offered in accordance with the procedures followed for all non-ELLs with  the addition of the home language as the mode of communication.       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  ELLs have access to a designated computer lab intended to enhance and accelerate language acquisition and promote college  preparedness.  It is utilized by ELLs in a variety of ways (e.g. conducting on-line research, building web-sites, preparing  Powerpoint presentations, participating in webinars, completing on-line examinations and activities, and posting and  evaluating opinions on blogs).  Achieve 3000, Read 180, System 44 and Rosetta Stone software has been integrated into the  curriculum to support differentiation. Authentic materials can be found in all ELL classrooms.  Literature selections include  more than 450 titles from Shakespeare to Khaled Hosseini. Non-fiction works include historical documents and current event  periodicals. As available, bilingual editions of text are also utilized. Additionally, texts are available in varied lexile levels and  graphic form to ensure accessibility of content for all ELLs.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      All ELLs in the TBE programs receive one forty-five minute period of HLA five days a week.  HLA instruction supports content,  culture and language acquisition.  All ELLs in freestanding ENL programs have access to bilingual dictionaries and libraries. DOE  approved bilingual materials are utilized. Teacher-created bilingual supports are evaluated by teams of content-certified and  language-certified teachers.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Curriculum and resource development is led by the Assistant Principal of ENL in collaboration with selected teacher teams  which review carefully to ensure age and grade-level appropriateness.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    The school, P.S. 811Q, co-located with us uses a single room in our building. There is no sharing of funding.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   To encourage a comfortable and successful transition for all new immigrants, newcomer orientations are offered prior to and  throughout the school year to ELLs and their families.  The orientations include: a school tour, review of student schedules and  the school calendar, overview of sequence and scope of courses with grade promotion and graduation requirements,  availability of support services and supplemental programs, advisement scheduling, and team and club offerings.   ELLs also  receive Welcome Backpacks with school supplies, including bilingual dictionaries.    ELLs and their parents and/or guardians are provided with school information through multiple avenues (e.g. open school  night, PTA meetings, student orientation meetings, the school website) and in multiple languages.   In addition, ELL parent  meetings, beyond PTCs, advise parents and students of student progress across the curriculum.    Training in the use of PupilPath for both parents and students allows access to student attendance and course performance.  It  also facilitates parent-teacher communication.    Bilingual assemblies provide students with grade-level appropriate information (e.g. college application process for seniors) in  their home languages.    The Title III Saturday program has open enrollment to provide supplementary language/content/culture instruction.    Parents meetings are conducted by Ms. Constance Miaoulis, Parent Coordinator and selected guidance  counselors.  Interpreters are present at all meetings.    Newcomer orientations are conducted by Mr. Rezaul Khan, NYSISTELL Coordinator, Ms. Sylvia Huh, ELL Parent Coordinator  and/or Ms. Jacqueline Irving-Mongui, AP of ENL and World Languages, with interpreters present as well.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    ELLs are offered the same language electives as non-ELLs.  These include instruction in seven languages--Chinese, Korean,  Japanese, French, Italian, Spanish and Latin--as well as English electives, such as journalism and drama.  ELLs may also  complete advanced placement coursework and examination in English and/or any of the World or home languages.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  All members of the faculty and all ELL personnel (including guidance counselors, Parent Coordinator, ELL Parent Outreach and  Information Specialist, school psychologist, occupational/physical therapists, and secretaries) and are supported with on-going  professional development.   A UFT-teacher Center at FLHS offers ELL professional development throughout the year and  department PD addresses content-specific needs .  Topics may include but are not limited to:  Vocabulary Instruction for All  Students, The Affective Filter, Effective Co-teaching Models, Using the Common Core Progressions for Instructional Planning,  Understanding and Addressing the Needs of ELLs in the Content-Area Classroom, Using Data to Inform Instruction, Scaffolding  for Success, and Writing Across Content Areas.

The Assistant  Principal of ENL/WL and the Instructional Coach are available throughout the day to provide assistance in lesson planning,  instruction and assessment.  Attendance at workshops is recorded, kept on file in the principal's office, and credited to the  mandated hours of ELL training.     In addition, teachers of ELLs participate in collegial inter-visitations across the curriculum.   This provides opportunities to  observe best practices, align curricula across departments and with CCSS,  promote teacher inquiry and increase the academic  rigor.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  A minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the required professional development hours for all teachers prescribed by CR Part 80  will be dedicated to language acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating  language and content instruction for English language learners. For all bilingual and English as a new language teachers, a  minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the required professional development hours will be dedicated to language acquisition in  alignment with core content area instruction, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating  language and content instruction for English language learners.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59         Calendar and PD topics topics TBD.  Agendas and attendance records will be maintained by Ms. Ora Verstandig, the Instructional Coach.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Annual individual ELL parent meetings take place in January or February in the evening and afternoon.  Notifications are made  via school web-site, phone master, and written notification in the parents' preferred language. Teachers of ELLs (ENL and  content area) are available to discuss language development progress and needs and proficiency assessment  results.  Interpreters assist with communication in the parents' preferred language.  Interpreters are present and the  assistance of the DOE Language and Interpretation Unit is utilized as needed.  Parents/Guardians who are unable to attend are  contacted via phone or teleconference.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Parents of ELLs are active members in our school, including at PTA meetings, Titles I and III parent workshops and school  celebrations, such as The International Festival, The Lunar New Year Celebration, the Day of the Dead, and Hangeul Day  Celebration.  Interpreters are present at all parent workshops and school functions to facilitate communication.  Workshops  are determined based on parent responses to interest/need questionnaires.    Francis Lewis High School provides free transportation and accompanying interpreters to ELL parent workshops off-site (e.g.  ELL Parent Academy at NYU).    In addition, parents are offered evening adult ENL classes at FLHS through OACE and free Rosetta Stone accounts to facilitate  English language acquisition.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, David Marmor, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Francis Lewis High School                                                                              School DBN: 26Q430  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      A thorough examination of the data collected through the Home Language Information Surveys (HLIS) and RAPL  (Adults preferred language ATS) was performed. The home languages of ELLs and non-ELLs were reviewed to  determine the primary languages of high and low incidence. The four languages, other than English, most  frequently identified by respondents as the home language were Chinese, Spanish, Bengali, and Korean. Input  from members of the school community, including but not limited to the NYSITELL/BESIS and Parent Coordinators,  ELL Parent Outreach and Information Specialist, and parents, was also elicited through parent questionnaires and  oral communication.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63     2.

Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      To ensure that all parents are empowered with the knowledge and information needed to actively participate in their  children’s education and avail their children of all the opportunities and services afforded by the school, selected  members of the faculty and staff will provide on-going language assistance needs assessment through close  monitoring of the HLIS of incoming students, RAPL and RCPL ATS reports, student demographics, and  translation/interpretation requests. Selected members include, but are not limited to, the ELL Parent Outreach an  Information Specialist, the LAC, the ENL Coordinator, the Parent Coordinator, and the Assistant Principal of ENL. This  proactive approach will indicate any change in need early on so that it can be addressed in a timely manner.       Notification of parental rights regarding translation and interpretation services as well as instructions on how to  obtain them will be provided in written and oral form in the native language of the parent through a variety of means  including but not limited to: letter, the admissions process, parent newsletter, school web-site, open house, PTA  meetings, parent workshops and parent-teacher and guidance conferences. Furthermore, a welcome poster in  multiple languages indicating the availability of such services and the location of where they may obtained will be  posted in full view at the main entrance, the Principal’s office, and other offices frequented by parents (e.g. guidance  office, ENL office). The Parents' Bill of Rights, and Guide to Language Access will also be provided in the Principal,  Guidance, Admissions, and ENL Department offices. Language ID guides will be in full view and accessible at the  security desk, Principal's, Medical, Guidance and department offices.      To ensure that parents of ELLs are able to reach administrative offices, the school safety plan includes procedures to  address language assistance needs. The recorded school welcome message and directory are translated into the  parents’ preferred languages of communication.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       Feedback is gathered by the Parent, the Language Access, and the ELL Parent Outreach and Information Coordinators  via parent surveys in the parents' preferred language of communication, on-line (e.g. Google forms), written (i.e. hard  copy) and oral to ensure accessibility. Surveys are distributed during school functions and analyzed in a timely manner  by selected members of the faculty and parents representing our diverse population to gauge the quality and  availability of services and to guide improvements as needed.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68
