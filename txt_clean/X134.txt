This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   To ensure that each and every child that passes through the doors of CS 134 is provided with the highest quality  education and necessary skills for college and career. To develop in every child, a love for learning that lasts  throughout their lives.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Our school supports learning for all members of our school community including students, school staff, parents and  families. The school has collaborated with many community based organizations and have formed partnerships with  the following: New York Edge, which provides after-school and extra-curricular activities; Visiting Nurse Service of NY  also provides parent outreach and workshops for parents; Center for Integrated Education (CITE), works with  teachers, parents and students in various professional learning experiences and Cub Scouts of America, who work  weekly with our students in developing character, social and emotional skills. Visiting Nurse Services of New York  serves as a resource for parents and students in crisis.       The school has a safe and inclusive environment that is conducive to student learning and teachers’ professional  growth. Administrators and teachers analyze student performance by class and subgroups and inform teachers of  necessary instructional and curricular adjustments to support student learning.       Teachers use data from formative and summative assessments to identify goals that enable students to work towards  mastery of Common Core Learning Standards.      In order to maximize learning for ENL (English as a New Language) students, they are placed in specific classes by  grade in order to allow the ENL teacher to push in during instruction. As a result, at least 10% of ENL students who  take the NYSESLAT Exam test out of ENL each year. Students with disabilities who perform at a level 2 or higher in ELA  or Math are integrated for instruction in those subjects, in a general education setting. To meet the needs of students  who are at risk or not meeting standards, we will be implementing small group instruction during a focused after  school program using Performance Tasks from Engage NY for Math and Coach ELA for Reading and Writing. This  program will be differentiated to customize individual learning for students. Acquiring basic skills in Literacy/Writing  and Math is the instructional focus for the school year 2018-2019.       The teacher team structure is organized around grade level inquiry and school improvement planning, resulting in  increased collaboration and a focus on improving student achievement.      For the 2018-2019 school year we will continue our work with Teacher's College implementing the Reader's and  Writer's Workshop. In order to increase our Math scores we will continue using the Eureka Math curriculum. Students  in grades k-2, as well as students who need math intervention, are administered the Early Childhood Assessment in  Mathematics to target individual and group needs.    In order to promote parent engagement, the school provides parents with learning opportunities on a monthly basis  including arts and crafts, cooking and curriculum. We have parents working with Visiting Nurse Services of New York,  who are school based as of Spring 2018 two days per week. The attendance at PTA meetings continues to increase   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      with specialty activities, food, gifts and performances. We must continue to increase parent involvement as we move  forward. Perfect Attendance certificates are presented at each PTA meeting, with one specific grade to receive  certificates in front of parents.       Curriculum fairs and “Make and Take” workshops are conducted 5x per year in order to engage parents in school  activities. Tuesdays are also opportunities for parents to meet with teachers to discuss progress and student  achievement throughout the school year. During the 2018-2019 school year, we are going to conduct a parent  workshop during the Parent engagement time that are relative to the issues our families are facing. Each grade will be  responsible for a workshop each month.      The School Leadership Team, grade leaders and PTA provide monthly workshops and other activities for parents in  order to increase parent involvement and deepen their understanding to increase their child’s academic performance  and social/emotional well-being. This is done through partnerships with VNSNY, SASF and contracted  vendors(ART/Dance).      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Community School 134, George Bristow Elementary, is geographically located in the Morrisania section of the Bronx.  The school grades range from Pre-Kindergarten to Grade 5. There are 627 students currently enrolled, with the  majority of students (93.4%) eligible for free lunch.       Our student population is comprised of 40.2% Black, 54.1% Latino, and 5.7% other ethnic backgrounds. 14.3% of our  student population is English Language Learners, with students from Latin American, African, and Arabic backgrounds.  19.2% of the student population consists of Students with Disabilities.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   One of the school initiatives is to increase parent engagement. To bring more parents into the building, the parent  coordinator will schedule parent classes that include GED preparation, English as a New Language, and technology  courses.       The school needs to ensure that instruction in all classes include strategies or routines which further promote student  independence and engagement and offer strategic supports that help all students achieve higher-order thinking and  application of skills. (Domain 3, Danielson) We saw a 6% increase in ELA Scores since working with TC.      The school also needs to continue to provide multiple opportunities for teacher leaders to model systems, structures  and pedagogical strategies during Professional Development sessions.

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     While 50% of teachers are effectively using a system of formative and summative assessment data, we, as a school,  still need to ensure that all teachers are using formative and summative assessment data to better inform instruction  and meet the needs of students to promote higher student achievement across grades and disciplines. We as a school  provided teachers yearlong PD in Running Records and their analysis to inform instruction. All teachers now have  hands on experience in administering and analyzing running records to inform instruction and increase student  achievement. Our school had a 1.2% increase in ELA state test scores, which means that we have a 26.3% proficiency  rating. The Measure of Teacher Practice data shows that as a school, we need to focus in on improving Using  Assessment in Instruction ratings.       Data Source: F&P and Progress Monitoring, MOTP Growth Explorer       Currently we are administering F&P 3x per year. (September, January, May). Teachers are asked to complete running  records monthly for their students to track their progress and inform grouping and targeted instruction. All teachers  are now doing this with varied levels of success. At the end of each assessment period, we will lead a goal setting  meeting with teachers using the TC Assessment Pro database to progress monitor.       Data Source: PPO-Focus Area-Teacher teams will better analyze student work/progress from common assessments as  indicated in year long assessment calendar, including progress for groups such as English language learners and  students with disabilities , and make adjustments to their unit plans. Teachers will then provide feedback to school  leaders at monthly grade leader meetings. AP's will create data boards to analyze and track student progress to  capture data at a school wide level to provide a big picture view of school progress towards meeting goals.      Data Source: School and grade leaders look at NYS data in Mathematics (2017-18, 16.1% Proficient) and English  Language Arts (2017-18, 26.3% Proficient) as well as F&P. The Item Analysis is used at the beginning and at the end of  the year and F & P data is tracked three times per year. Although this data is discussed among staff, it does not yet  connect with the curricula data that teachers and teacher teams are collecting to create a clear, school wide, coherent   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14      analysis of curricula. We are working with TC Data Staff to provide PD in analyzing data to increase student  achievement via the TC Assessment Pro database.       Data Source: Grade Leaders/Team Meetings: Based on Grade Meetings and Cabinet meetings with grade leaders we  have found that 50% of our teachers lack the skill in analyzing/using data to inform rigorous instruction as well as  understanding individual student needs.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   By June of 2019, we will increase reading and math proficiency across all grade levels as evidenced by a 5% increase in  the percentage of students scoring at or above grade level level 3 from 26% to 29% (ELA) and from 16% to 19% (Math)  as measured by the ELA and Math State Test Scores.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional  development, and/or systems and structures needed  to impact change.

What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  We as a school understand the importance of a child’s social emotional development and its connection to academic  success. We have one guidance counselor to service both our mandated and non-mandated students. We have a  Community Associate for parent/community/child outreach. Our PTA is very active in our school and work with  children during lunch and after school. We have a Teacher Center specialist that serves as a coach in both ELA and  Math. All of the above mentioned constituents along with Administration and Teachers work in collaboration to meet  the social and emotional well-being of all students. We are looking forward to a full implementation of Restorative  Circles, to improve students time on task and student achievement, socially, emotionally and academically. We will  continue to fully implement, as part of school culture, all ten traits of Cloud 9 character development. The Quality  Review indicator 3.4 from 2018 indicates that the school has consistent communication of high expectations resulting  in a culture of mutual accountability for teaching and learning allowing all students to own their educational  experiences and preparing them for the next level.       We are going to continue an advisory program where all adults are responsible for at least one student who is  exhibiting low achievement in social, emotional, and academic areas. This needs to be an area of focus as we have  seen an increase in incident reports with new enrollment.   Teachers continue to use Brain Power strategies during transitions to support learning.    Data Source: Our OORS Report Data shows an increase in OORS reports for the 2017-18 school year by 100 incidents  from 117 to 217. This is 100% increase.

Teachers are using formative data sources such as TC Running Records, NYCPT ELA and Math, i-Ready, monthly  writing work (daily), and ongoing running records (2x per month) in October, February and May to screen and plan for  individual students’ needs, as well as to place students in instructional groups. The challenge for teachers has been to  find tools that will help progress monitor throughout the school year to inform their instruction and make the  necessary adjustments for all/and groups of students. We continue to work on progress monitoring as a key to  student improvement.    Data Source: NYS ELA/Math Preliminary data Spring 2018 “Met Criteria” in ELA/Math and Item Analysis for NYS ELA  and Math.   This data identified children who met preliminary requirements. After receiving actual scores, only 26.3% (ELA) and  16.1% (Math) actually met on the NYS exams. This year we also used preliminary scores for summer school as well as  teacher created portfolios of student work. After receiving actual scores we will reevaluate student needs in  September and continue to do so weekly and monthly throughout the 2018-2019 school year.   Data Source : TC Running Records, Writing Samples, Unit Tests, Interim Assessments   All teachers have been retrained in the administration of running records and analyzing the data to inform instruction.  Receiving Teachers will use this data to plan for 2018-2019. Teachers will continue to receive professional  development in the administration and norming of running records and progress monitoring tools.       Collaborations within the inquiry teams strengthen teachers' instructional capacity while data reveals increases in  student achievement.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  Recruitment    We recruit teachers through HR, Job Fairs, Interviews and Model lessons. Our school team has developed interview  questions as well as an evaluation sheet that is discussed and used to further the candidate along the interview  process. If a prospective candidate is called back for a model lesson, Danielson is used to evaluate that lesson for its  effectiveness and a decision is then made about possible employment. We created a hiring team in May 2018.  UFTTC/NTC Coach will support all new hires.   Retention    In order to retain teachers we provide extensive PD and support through our New Teacher Center and Math Coach as  well other support and outside PD that we send staff to attend. By providing support for teachers to succeed in the  classroom and school, we have found that we have very low turnover rates. Teachers who leave usually do so due to  retirement or relocation.   Assignments    Teachers are assigned based on strengths and data (formative and summative assessments and Danielson  observations). 98% of our teachers are teaching in their license area.   Professional Development    We began with Professional Learning sessions from the Citywide Instructional Expectations to bring a cohesive  understanding to the work that needs to be done in order to provide our students with rigorous, engaging, purposeful  instruction. Based on CIE and administrative observations, student data (F&P, MOSL, State Exams, and teacher input),  a high quality professional development plan was set in motion.

We also plan to continue the design of IEP goals that meet student  needs and align them to the CCLS. We will continue to work with teachers on progress monitoring, looking at student  work using the ATLAS protocol, planning and preparation and guided reading.        2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   Administrative staff attends monthly PD conducted by UFTTC/NTC Coach, Teachers College, ELI and other  organizations. Administrative staff continues to improve their craft through professional journals, books, and articles  and ESSA training.   Paraprofessionals receive training each Monday from 2:35 p.m. to 3:55 p.m in how to support instruction in the  classroom.Teachers work within their professional learning teams 2x per month during common planning time, and  PD every Monday from 2:35 p.m. to 3:55 p.m. The focus of PD this year will be using data more effectively and its  impact on student achievement.

We have our Pre K teachers sit in with our Kindergarten Teachers and discuss curriculum. Pre K teachers are included  in all PD. Early interventions are provided and information about students is shared. Teachers receive monthly PD  from Pre K social worker. Teachers are following Units of Study for Pre K and evaluating students using ECERS.        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.        Assessments are discussed with administration, UFT and grade leaders and then brought back to grade level  constituents. Decisions are then discussed and made based on student needs.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40     may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41            IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Community School 134 Parent Involvement Policy    Parent and Family Engagement Policy      Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. CS 134, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school.

Students in  grades 2, 3 & 4 demonstrated difficulty in academic vocabulary, fluency, and the writing of  English.  Based on results of 2018 NYSESLAT; 14 of our students remained at the same  proficiency level and demonstrated a significant drop in the area of writing.  Eight of our  students mostly dropped one proficiency level from 2016 to 2017.  The focus is to increase  proficiency for  Emerging,  Transitioning , and Expanding students.  Grades 2, 3 & 4 ELL students will receive supplemental ENL instruction from 2 teachers who  are TESOL certified. The focus for the supplemental instruction is in reading and  writing. The  selected programs of instruction will be Imagine Learning and Language Power Reading and  Writing.  Imagine Learning is a technology-based program specifically designed to assist  students in second language acquisition. Language Power Reading and Writing builds language  proficiency with a highly differentiated component. It also provides the rigorous instruction  needed in all four language domains.   Students will also receive additional intervention support  in writing strategies, mechanics, and vocabulary.  50% of instructional time will be devoted to  Imagine Learning  while the other 50% will be focused on Language Power. In addition, students  will receive New York State English as a Second Language Achievement Test (NYSESLAT)  preparation.  Students will practice test prep for 45 minutes weekly during the After School  program. Title III funds will be used to purchase materials. Imagine Learning will continue to be  used along with Language Power during the after school program. Teachers will  be  provided classroom libraries, which are also part of the Language Power program to work with  students.  Beginning students are instructed using Basic Interpersonal Communication Skills  (BICS) through various techniques: TPR, SIOP model, music, etc. Theses approaches are  research-based and yield the most results with our Long-term ELL and Transitioning level  students.  Emerging and Transitioning students will be instructed using comprehension skills as a focus  using the Imagine Learning program. The focus of both after school programs for our  ELLs will be on building and expanding their academic vocabulary, while also developing and  strengthening their foundational reading skills.  Ongoing assessment will be used to progress  monitor student success and the success of the program. Activities will consist of group work,  independent work, and shared/independent writing.  The program is scheduled for 120 minutes, three days a week (Wednesday, Thursday, Friday) for  60 days, after school from 2:40 p.m - 4:40 p.m.  This program services a total of 40 students.  One class will be for Emerging and Transitioning students (20 students)  and the second class will be for  Long-term ELLs and Expanding students (20 students).    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   Selection of students is based on NYSESLAT results and classroom teacher referrals.    The projected start date for the after-school  academy is November, 2018 to April, 2019.  Attendance is taken on a regular basis and records are kept in a Title III binder.  A log of Title III  Parental Contact is kept in a binder along with student samples in the Main Office.

ELL  teachers receive training from outside providers such as UFT, Generation Ready, and Teacher's  College.  The PD will provide training not only to ENL teachers but also general education  teachers. These teachers in turn support students in the classroom using appropriate strategies.  Teachers involved with these two programs receive professional development on  correct usage  and implementation before and during instruction.  There is on-going training on how to analyze  student work to assess and revise student goals in collaboration with ELL liaison.  Teachers also  use results from NYSESLAT performance to assist in planning and preparation for the upcoming  exam.  Teachers also meet with students to discuss goals and progress. This information is used  to further support students during the after school program.    Professional development on Imagine Learning  online is scheduled for two days by an Imagine  Learning consultant; one in September, 2018 for teachers and one on November, 2018 for  parents. These dates are tentative and subject to confirmation of program. The cost of the  Imagine Learning consultant is funded by Title III funds. Additional professional  development  will be provided to teachers by trained ENL staff in order to support the students in  the general education classroom. This additional PD is at no cost.  An in-house staff member, the ELL Liaison, will provide training in Looking at Student Data.  Dates are as follows:    Tuesday, October 16, 2018 - Setting Goals (at no cost)  Tuesday, December 18, 2018 - Looking at Student Work & Next Steps (at no cost)  Tuesday, March 5, 2019- Looking as Student Work & Next Steps (at no cost)  The title of the first two workshops: Imagine Learning - Classroom Library/Imagine Learning  Reading-Online, will be conducted by Imagine Learning consultant (Title III funds).     After assessing students in January, ELL Liaison will look at student data and work with teachers  on how to use data to drive instruction and provide next steps for the remainder of the program.  Teachers can then determine what is needed to prepare students for NYSESLAT.  NYSESLAT prep is also reviewed with teachers during one of the Monday PLC days in order to  better prepare teachers on how to support ELL in their classrooms.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Students are assessed using Fountas & Pinnell (administered four times a year) and a baseline assessment which is the New  York City Performance Task as a tool to guide the academic focus.  The Performance Task is the selected growth model for the  school.  ELL interim assessments are administered twice a year and determines the focus for ENL instruction.  The data reflects  ELL students who have been assessed using these tools demonstrate a deficiency in vocabulary and comprehension skills.  40%  of our English language learners demonstrate low proficiency in Reading.  50% of our English language learners demonstrate  low proficiency in writing. Particular struggles continue to be in the area of expository writing, vocabulary development, and  reading fluency and text complexity.  Children with specific deficiencies in the different modalities are grouped together by  grade. Classroom teachers meet with the ENL teacher to plan on a weekly basis.  The data patterns also demonstrate that for  the past three years, 10-12% of our students continue to test out of ENL,  particularly, in Grade 4 and Grade 5.  The team  continues to analyze the data and look at evidence that demonstrates progress in these two grades.  Strategies are explored in  order to select the most appropriate resources, materials, and approaches that will enhance and support learning.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Currently, most of our free standing ENL students are placed in one class by proficiency level. This is in order to maximize the  hours needed to support students. Teachers who have ENL students in these classes are also provided with ENL strategies and  training to further support the learning.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The school is meeting the AYP for ELLs.  NYSESLAT results indicate ELL movement from one proficiency level to another.  ELLs  are also meeting school-wide goals and demonstrate improvement in writing portfolios. We analyze assessment data (NYS  ELA, NYS Math, NYSESLAT, Running Records, Periodic Assessments, etc.) with a lens for progress.  Meeting AYP for ENL  students are evaluated.  The push-in program has been most successful.  Each year, a bulk of our 4th and 5th Grade students  test in the Commanding level on the NYSESLAT. The after school academy continues to focus on students who  are Transitioning and Expanding. Several workshops for teachers are conducted to support ELL students in monolingual  classrooms.  Assessment and student learning is on an ongoing basis.  Teachers assess students at the beginning, during, and  after lessons using instruments for diagnosing reading and writing abilities, language proficiency, and general achievement.            4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Supplemental services are provided for ENL students after school twice a week. Explicit instruction is given in order to support  students in language and literacy. Selected pedagogical focus is given in concept development; differentiation, assessment ,  and feedback; questioning, academic language, and student discourse.  Several materials including technology is used to support learning.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Data (NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, ELA, Fountas & Pinnell, Unit Tests, etc.) is used to provide high quality instruction for ELL students.  Both the classroom teachers and the ENL teacher use data to identify the area of need, group students and plan appropriate  instruction.  This Tier II intervention takes place throughout the school day including when the ENL teacher pushes in for  services. The ENL teacher provides Tier II instruction by pushing-in classrooms during ELA instruction in Grades 3-5.  ENL  students with disabilities receive Tier III intensive and individualized instruction through after-school support in addition to  pull-out service.  K-2 students are pulled out for instruction for both Tier II and Tier III support depending on how many units of  instruction individual students receive.  The ENL teacher conducts ongoing progress monitoring to ensure movement.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   There continues to be an influx of African and Latino students who speak various dialects entering the school system. Recently,  we are getting Arabic speaking students registered at the school. These students are identified as ENL students.  Students are  administered the NYSITELL.   Based on NYSITELL results, eligible students are placed in appropriate settings.   The data shows a  considerable growth among newcomers compared to our developing ENL students. Currently, the need for a bilingual program  may become necessary based on our increased Latino population. The results of the 2018 NYSESLAT demonstrates a high  concentration of Expanding ENL students. Our special education population continues to demonstrate little  progress.  Additional focus will be on this group of students.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Based on proficiency levels, ENL teacher creates a schedule that will maximize learning. This includes both the integrated and  pull-out model. Students who have scored the same proficiency levels on the NYSESLAT for three consecutive years are placed  in the extended day program for ENL students and also receive more explicit instruction during the day.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   C.S. 134 has a freestanding ENL program with all instruction in English. The ENL population is approximately 18.36% of  the population (currently inclu1ding current Kindergarten students).  This service is delivered to to ELLs via the pull- out and integrated models depending on the number of ELLs on the grade level.  ELLs in grades 3-5 receive instruction  in English content area classes such as ELA, math, science and social studies and are brought together for high quality  English acquisition focused instruction.  The ENL teacher pushes into as well as push into all classrooms to provide  both small group and additional support to ELLs. The current program is for 114  students, with a high concentration  of African and Latino students.  There are no 2 SIFE students.  The current majority is at the Transitioning and  Expanding levels.  Students are generally grouped by grade but are homogeneously grouped by level of proficiency  within the program.  Our ENL program is aligned with mandated ENL, ELA and content area learning standards and  the core curriculum.  The ENL teachers are licensed and receive ongoing professional development.      b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Paste response to questions here:      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Paste response to questions here:         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   As per CR Part 154, the organization of staff ensures that the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according  to proficiency levels in our ENL program by allowing the ENL teacher to either push-in to the classrooms or pull-out of the  classrooms to service students.  Teachers of ELLs are notified in September of the ELLs in their classrooms.  These teachers are  trained in second language acquisition and given an overview of NYSESLAT requirements.  The ENL teacher informs classroom  teachers about students' NYSESLAT scores.  The level of English language proficiency, as well as the scores on all four  modalities are also discussed. Data is analyzed and targeted students receive additional support. ELL students are also invited  to attend the Title III After School program in order to receive extra support. The ENL teacher and classroom teacher  collaborate in planning and working toward a common goal for each student.       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Content area instruction is all in English in the classrooms with native language support when possible.  Classrooms have  libraries with Spanish books.  English/Spanish and English/French dictionaries and glossaries are available to help support  students during content area instruction. Currently, we plant to purchase additional Arabic book to  support our Arabic speaking population. The students who speak other languages are supported through peer translation and  technology.  The ENL program focuses on reading, writing, listening and speaking in English with content are subjects  integrated as well.  If an ENL student is having specific trouble with a topic, the ENL teacher is available to help. Teachers  instruct using ENL strategies such as differentiated instruction, scaffolding for all students, TPR for newcomers, using visuals,  graphic organizers and some teachers have smart boards in their classroom to help with translation when needed through  technology. Teachers are explicit in their instruction to help all students.  They always question and assess students to make  sure the content is comprehensible and students are developing English language skills.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57         4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      N/A     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Currently, we have two SIFE students. These students will be included in our after school supplemental program. The ENL  teacher groups students according to proficiency areas within the grade.  Newcomers and Developing learners receive both  integrated and Pull-out services where the teacher provides small group instruction using interactive resources.  The main  program for newcomers is Imaging Learning which is a technology based program that provides visuals support. This program  also has a home component where students can continue to practice language at home.  Our former ELL work on Language Power, which is a text-based program that contains high-interest text aligned to the  CCLS.  The classroom teacher also works with  former ELLs during the extended learning program after school.  Students are  given instruction in small groups with scaffolds that reinforce student learning.  Test accommodations are given to all ELL and former ELL students.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Teachers of ELL -SWD students use explicit instructional strategies that both access to academic content areas and accelerate  English language development by separating tasks into smaller components.  Separating tasks, help students achieve the goal  and complete tasks.  Teachers use strategies to fit the needs of their students to provide access to academic content areas and  to accelerate English language development.  Teachers assess their students' multiple intelligences to see what kind of learner  they are and then teach using strategies to accommodate their students' learning style.  If a child is a visual learner, the  teacher will use the appropriate approaches.  Students who need help understanding and answering inferential questions, the  teachers will practice skills on vocabulary and context clues to make connections.  Teachers also use prior knowledge and use  different genres to help identify specific books.  Particularly, non-fiction.  Grade level materials are used with teacher support  and students build their knowledge until they can use materials on their own.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  The school uses curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to meet the diverse needs of ELL-SWD students within the  least restrictive environment by pulling children out of the classroom while their class is working on the subject that they have  the most difficulty.  Students are supported in breaking down material in a more comprehensible fashion.  The teachers  address the students' areas of need by matching appropriate instruction.         8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Results of running records are identified and appropriate strategies are utilized during Tier II and III intervention. Based on  results from the New York City Performance Tasks, the ENL teacher works on writing strategies and small group instruction  during push-in. Lessons provide scaffolds and methodologies successfully implemented by the ENL teacher.  Targeted  intervention in Math focuses on student work and unit assessments.  Math lessons utilize manipulative and are modified to  meet the need of ENL students.  After-school intervention is also provided.  During academic intervention, students also prepare for the ELA with ENL teacher. Other content areas are also addressed if  the child needs help in other subject areas.  The success of the ENL program is due to the collaborative effort of the teachers  with the goal of helping each ELL meet or exceed NYS and City learning standards.  Teachers work together to deliver a  balanced approach to literacy as well as tailor content area instruction.  The classroom teachers and ENL teacher meet to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      articulate the instructional plan for the week to ensure curricular alignment incorporating the necessary methodology and  instructional strategies.  Formal and informal assessments are ongoing and include portfolios and projects to determine  growth towards meeting standard work.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      N/A     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  After-school programs are available to ELL students through Title III funds.  Differentiated instruction is practiced using ENL  methodology. Extended time after school is taught by two licensed ENL teachers, from 2:35 p.m. - 5:00 p.m.  Material used for  the program is supplemental to the reading and math program used during the day.  Transitional and Former ELLs  use  the Language Power Reading program.  The rationale behind using this program is to provide extra support in order for  students to perform at grade level on the NYS ELA and NYSESLAT.  This program also provides extra enrichment, vocabulary,  reading comprehension strategies, and writing support.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Imagine Learning is used for Grades K-2; Imagine Learning is used for Grades 3-5.  Students and parents have access to  Imagine Learning at home to support learning. Both technology programs have been set up so that parents and students have  access to material at home.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   All materials are sent home in English and students' home languages.  The translation and interpretation unit is utilized for  specific materials sent home. Parents can also reach out to the ELL liaison who can assist with glossaries and dictionaries.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    The Bilingual Social Worker and Guidance Counselor are on site to support our ENL students.  There is also a Speech Therapist  who provides services to our native Spanish speakers.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Imagine Learning Reading is used for Grades K-5. Students and parents have access to Imaging Learning at home to support  learning.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   An orientation is given to students who are newly arrived.  The ELL teacher, classroom teachers, Guidance Counselor, and  Community Associate, take part in this orientation which is usually given in collaboration with a parent orientation session in  September.  Here is a "Meet and Greet" designed for students who are new to the school, conducted by classroom teachers  and Community Associate, and CBO.  are invited to "Meet and Greet" as a way to inform parents on after-school programs,  health and welfare outreach, sports, arts, and other school community related programs.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    C.S 134 does not offer any foreign language classes.  However, there are staff members who speak a second language who also  assist ELL students when needed.        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59         a.

What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The professional  development plan for ELL personnel including teachers of ELL students, includes training for teachers in ENL  strategies, methodologies, second language acquisition.  This training is provided by in-house personnel licensed in  ESL.  Teachers of ENL students are encouraged to take courses leading to ENL extension. Study groups in SIOP strategies focus  on second language acquisition and planning aligned to Danielson Framework. Generation Ready provides a consultant who  has been and continues to train teachers of ENL students.

A designated staff member holding a special education license will  attend the monthly workshops and then turnkey information to other teachers of ELLs.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  In order to support ENL students who will be transitioning from elementary to middle school, the Guidance Counselor,  Community Associate, Assistant Principal, and Parent Association provide various support systems for parent and  students. Inter-visitations with neighboring schools are encouraged and assist parent in making informed decisions about  where they would like their child to attend.  The Parent Coordinator and Guidance Counselor monitor and support the middle  school selection and application process.  These staff members arrange time to meet with parents and families to provide  translation services and guidance in selection of appropriate schools to meet individual student needs as well as to complete  necessary forms.    Support is provided to staff to assist ELLs as they transition from elementary to middle school includes trainings.      The ENL Coordinator is responsible for providing the necessary training for teacher of ENL students.  Training is provided by  Generation Ready and in-house. Training hours are recorded and placed in teachers' files.           Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60            Every year, the school is making every effort to increase parental involvement. This is attributed to programs that have  become available to parents.  There are several workshops conducted for parents of ELL students by ENL teacher and other  contracted personnel.  The ENL teacher, Assistant Principal, and Parent Coordinator have worked very closely together in  planning and providing additional services.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  Other parental involvement events include the quarterly award ceremonies, Back to School Night, parent-teacher conferences,  PTA meetings, parent workshops, SLT meetings, and field trips.  Our partners with the Sports & Arts provides workshops to  parents.  Among parental needs addressed by the school are translation and childcare services during workshops.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Martin Alvarado, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   C.S. 134                                                                              School DBN: 12X134  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

Yes/No       (*Primary)             * The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs  on translation,   interpretation, compliance and budget.      School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Based on the needs assessment survey conducted at the beginning of the school year, members of the ELL team  made te following recommendations for services beneficial to our non-English speaking population:      -Most materials are scheduled for translation prior to meetings. New materials, if not provided in Spanish, are  translated by a member of the faculty as soon as possible in order to be available in a timely manner. Requests  are also made to the Translation and Interpretation Unit in advance in order to have materials translated on time.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64      -Data based on yearly accountability status demonstrates an increase in different ethnic and cultural backgrounds  other than Spanish. This includes recent immigrants and transfer students coming from various cultural  backgrounds (Arabic, African, Latino). We find that for some African dialects, French is an official language. A  French-speaking staff member assists with translation during the initial enrollment process and completion of the  HLIS. During the parent choice orientation, information is translated in one of the five languages available,  otherwise arrangements must be made to ensure parents are explained the process in their native language.      All materials are prepared in the summer, based on data provided on the demographic breakdown on ATS.  Parents need more assistance in understanding effective instructional practices necessary for increasing the  academic performance of their child(ren). Workshops are provided throughout the year to parents in order to  assist them in utilizing strategies at home.         2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     Written Preferred    Percent Written          Oral Preferred    Percent Oral          Language    The preferred languages at  C.S. 134 are English,  Spanish, Fulani, and  French. These are the  native languages that make  up the majority. A limited  number of our parents  need Arabic translation.  Currently, we have a staff  member who speaks  Arabic. The staff member  assists with translation  during Parent-Teacher  conferences. All other  written correspondence is  available unless specific to  our school. In this case, the  Translation and  Interpretation Unit is  contacted.            3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu).

Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      The Parent Coordinator also receives additional training about the translation and interpretation process when  necessary. The Guide is posted in the front entrance of the school. The Community Associate and PTA president play  major roles in identifying language needs of parents and the circulation of information. Parents' Bill of Rights is  available in the main office and is available in English, Spanish, Arabic, and French.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       A parent survey is given at the beginning and end of the school year. Theses surveys are analyzed to determine  specific concerns and needs of parents. Feedback is also gathered from the SLT and monthly parent meetings.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67
