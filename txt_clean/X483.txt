This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Our Mission at P.S. 483 The Matilda Avenue School is to create a community of life-long learners who are prepared to  meet the challenges of the 21st Century. Through rigorous and engaging standards based curriculum our students will  develop the creative and critical thinking skills necessary to solve real world problems. Thoughtful, collaborative  decision-making will support a positive educational environment. Our students will all learn best when they can take  educational risks and exhibit pride and independence in themselves and others. School wide learning will focus on the  skills students need to be college and career ready.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    P.S. 483 The Matilda Avenue School is a small, new elementary school in the Wakefield section of the Bronx. We  opened in September 2015 with two Kindergarten classes. For the 2018-2019 School Year, we will serve grades  Kindergarten, First, Second, and Third. We will be adding a grade level each year until fully grown, K-5, with  approximately 300 students in 2020. In 2017-2018, the school population comprised of 51% Black, 28% Hispanic, and  16% White students 2% are Multi-racial, and 2% American Indian. Boys accounted for 54% of the students enrolled  and girls accounted for 46%. The average attendance rate for the school year 2017-2018 was 91%   The Matilda Avenue school was founded on the belief that all students can learn when we make learning challenging,  engaging, and fun. We know that collaboration is the key to success and that partnerships increase student  achievement. The Matilda Avenue School will continue to partner with the following organizations for the 2018-2019  School; Education Through Music, which provides formalized music instruction to all students. The 47th Precinct,  where two officers have adopted our classrooms and come in once a month to participate in both student and family  events. The Law Firm of Sayfarth & Shaw, who provide books and supplies to our students and host Holiday  Celebrations. The Foodbank of New York which offers Cookshop weekly lessons and monthly parent lessons. Panera  Bread, which provides baked goods to our families in need. School Mental Health Consultant Program, which supports  us in connecting students and parents in need of assistance with local community agencies. Alvin Ailey American  Dance Theater provides parent workshops and a dance residency for our First Grade Students. Swim for Life, which  provides our Second Grade Students with free swim lessons. We will also continue to collaborate across our school  district through the IFC Collaborative facilitated by Irene Rogan. In addition we will collaborate with other school  districts though critical friends groups and Showcase School Visits. School staff will continue to be a part of  professional learning communities within our district and attend professional development offered through our Field  Borrow Support Centers.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   The student body includes 10 English Language Learners across all grade levels. Their specific needs include exposure  to English language, language acquisition, and vocabulary development. Currently, there are 12 students with  disabilities. Special needs include ICT, SETSS, Speech, Guidance, Occupational and Physical Therapy Services.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Based on the preliminary results of our 2017-2018 Quality Review, our school was well developed in the areas of  Assessment, High Expectations, Leveraging Resources, Goals and Action Plans, and Teacher Teams and Leadership  Development. Our school was proficient in the areas of Curriculum, Pedagogy, Learning Environment, and Monitoring  and Revising Systems. Last year we adopted Teacher's College Reading & Writing Curriculum and will continue to  utilize resources from that program for the 2018-2019 school year. We will continue to use Fundations for word study  and Go Math! Curriculum for Math. We will incorporate Exemplars in Math as well to provide students with  opportunities for exploration and problem solving.   As a new school that is continuing to grow, we will continue to focus on creating a positive school culture that is  welcoming and safe. We will build trust among all stakeholders by identifying a common language in which we will  communicate how our mission and core values will support our collective goal of student achievement. Our intimate  environment gives everyone the unique opportunity to get to know one another on a personal level and to truly cater  to the individual needs of all of our students and their families. We will continue to collaborate with staff, students,  families, the community, and outside organizations to identify how we can work together to provide the resources  needed to support student achievement. All stakeholders will engage in cycles of goal setting, assessing, and revising.  We will use feedback and reflection as a tool for growth. Our focus will also include supporting our staff in providing  engaging and rigorous instruction that will equip our students with the skills needed to be successful. Throughout the  year we will monitor our progress toward meeting our goals.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 11X483   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   0K,01,02,03,04,05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   125   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Our School received a Proficient rating in the area of Curriculum 1.1 on our 2017-2018 Quality Review. Across content  areas, teachers and school leaders tactically plan in-depth units of study that reflect the instructional shifts and are  aligned to the Common Core. Rigorous habits for all students are coherently and strategically embedded into each  task and unit of study. We want to maintain cohesiveness and rigor in instruction across classrooms and vertically  across grade levels, as we continue to grow. A review of our end of year Reading Data collected in June 2018 indicated  that 73.3% of our students moved three or more reading levels. 47.6% of our students met the TC end of the year  benchmark. Our priority need in this area is to further develop our ELA curriculum so that more students will acquire  the skills necessary to meet or exceed grade level ELA standards.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  Recruitment for available positions for 2018-2019 included advertising on the DOE website, Open Market Hiring  System, and New Teacher Finder. Of the hundreds of applicants that applied, the 18D Hiring Committee, comprised of  all staff members at P.S. 483, thoughtfully selected highly qualified candidates who are certified in the appropriate  license areas. Using a criteria based rubric, all applicants were screened to find potential candidates based on  qualifications necessary for the positions that needed to be filled. As a new school, each year we will be growing and  adding new staff members. During the interview and hiring process expectations are clearly defined including what it  means to work in a new, small school and what contributions each staff member can make to our community.  Retention of staff is critical to building a new community, therefore communication is encouraged to support staff in  what they need to be successful . As a small school with a limited staff and budget, new staff is hired strategically to  meet the needs and compliance of various learners, for example,preference is given to teachers with duel  certifications or bilingual extensions, Assignments are based on the qualifications of staff including appropriate  certifications, level of experience, and interest level of teacher. High quality professional development is customized  based on individual teacher goals, and support is given to assist teachers in meeting their goals through weekly  individual conferences with administration.         2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   As a community of life-long learners, the staff of P.S. 483 is committed to continuing to grow and learn to improve our  practices and to find the best ways to meet the needs of all of our students. Student achievement is our common goal  and the basis for which all decisions are made. Professional Development at P.S. 483 will be focused on team building  and establishing trust as we learn about one another and identify individual strengths and needs. We will all engage in  cycles of goal setting, feedback, reflection, and revisions as we work together to meet the challenges of educating 21  st century learners. Staff will also engage in cycles of inquiry as a way of developing best practices and using data to  drive instruction.        Part 3: TA Schools Only   3a.

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).  During the registration process, school staff meets with each parent and child to discuss the child's school history  including all academic, social, and medical needs and/or accommodations. Orientation is provided prior to the start of  the school year so that parents and students can learn more about our school including curriculum and expectations.  Materials are distributed to help parents and students prepare for Kindergarten. In July, a Summer Book Exchange is  held to promote a positive experience with the school culture prior to the first day of school. A Welcome Picnic is held  in August so that parents, students, and staff have an opportunity to meet and get to know one another prior to  school opening.         4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     All staff meets prior to the start of the new school year to plan the assessment calendar for the year. As part of the  planning process for each unit of study, teachers and administration collaborate to determine the assessments that  will be used to capture growth and drive instruction. The Professional Development Team collaborates to design  professional development that supports our school wide instructional focus which is alignment with our CEP goals and  impacts student achievement.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37        Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 483 The Matilda Avenue School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of  Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent  involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the  families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision- making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School  Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of  the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   P.S. 483 The Matilda Avenue School, will support parents and families of Title I students by:   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  All students in grades K-2 will be given The Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment three times a year. In addition we will  be administering performance based assessments at the end of each TCRWP ELA Unit of Study that will be analyzed to  determine writing skills. All lessons will include language objectives that will be assessed and data will be monitored to inform  future instruction. Data collected is analyzed by both the classroom teacher and our ENL provider.  Common Planning time  allows for both teachers to look at individual student data and make decisions on curriculum and instruction based on  need.  Student work samples are collected and analyzed throughout each unit of study to determine next steps and to drive  future instruction.   Modifications include visual supports and vocabulary building for those students who need it.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Teachers meet daily for common planning and weekly with Administration.  Unit Maps and Plans include instruction to support  ENL students.  Common Planning between classroom teachers and ENL provide allows for shared objectives and plans.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46         3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?   Summative assessments including NYC Performance Tasks, Go Math Beginning, Middle, & End of the Year Assesments,  Fountas & Pinnell Benchmark Assessments, and the NYSESLAT Exam are being used to identify baseline and progress  data,  Teacher's College  Rubrics aligned to the common core standards for reading, writing, listening, and speaking will be  used to assess specific areas of need and monitor student progress toward meeting grade level language standards.         4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Support Staff has access to all data and an opportunity to collaborate with classroom teachers to plan appropriate scaffolds  and support.  Daily Common Planning on each grade levels provides teachers with an opportunity to collaborate to design  appropriate interventions.  Daily schedules allow for blocks of instruction and support staff's schedules allow for them to  support students within the classroom during their scheduled literacy or math block based on need.        5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]    Additional support services will be provided to English Language Learners who score below grade level on the annual English  language proficiency assessments.  Tier One interventions in ELA and Math will be utilized within the classroom setting and will  include both small group instruction and computer based remediation programs.  Teachers will follow the protocol for  referring students to the RTI team for Tier Two or Tier Three intervention as needed.  The protocol includes a  teacher referral  should be submitted to Team Leader. Parent Notification Letter should be sent home to parents informing them of the  referral. Notify team members and referring teachers of time, location and date of referral meetings. RTI Folder started for  each student (items in folder include,Referral, Action Plan, Progress Tracker, Assessments & Work Samples). Case Manager will  be assigned to the case. Teacher shares the referral with the team. Dialog ensues. Determination is made. Action Plan  is drafted.  Following the intervention, Case Manager tracking report is shared. There is a rreview of recent classroom grades  and new assessment data. We ddiscuss the following: change intervention, Increase or decrease support, Continue, dismiss, or  refer to next tier.       6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Since we currently service K-2 students only,  NYSESLAT and NYSITELL scores are analyzed for information.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Our Data Specialist disseminates these findings to administration, classroom teachers, and our ENL providers.  Weekly Data  Inquiry meetings with each grade level provide an opportunity for staff to collaborate on scaffolds and supports needed to  curriculum and instruction that will best meet the needs of our ENL learners.              Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Once students are given the NYSITELL exam and are identified as ENL students, then based on their level, instruction  will be provided which will include a push-in model for integrated and a pull out model for standalone ENL  instruction.   Students will be grouped within the same grade level by class. Our ENL provider will push-in to the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47         classroom to provided integrated instruction working alongside with the classroom teacher.

How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?    All ENL students will receive 100% of their ENL/ELA instructional time based upon  CR Part  154  requirements.  Beginner/Entering students receive  a total of 360 minutes per week. 180 minutes of stand alone ENL  provided by an ENL teacher who pulls out students from their classroom and 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA where the  ENL teacher pushes into the classroom.  Low Intermeidate/Emerging students also receive 360 minutes of instruction per week  with the same model.  Intermediate/Transitioning students receive 180 minutes of instruction.  90 minutes are integrated  ELA and 90 minutes is integrated with other subject areas.  Advanced/Expanding students receive 180 minutes using the same  model.  Proficient/Commanding students receive 90 minutes of integrated ELA instruction.       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Students will be taught in English.  Using an ENL model, integrated instruction will be taught within the classrooms provided by  our ENL and classroom teachers.  Stand alone ENL instruction will be pull out instruction provided by our ENL teacher.  The  focus will be on the four modalities, listening, speaking, reading and writing.  Language development will be a focus for all  students.  Each ELA Unit of Study will include language specific standards.  The SIOP Model will be utilized to foster language  development. The demands of NYS Learning Standards will be met utilizing scaffolds and supports such as visual aids,  repetition, graphic organizers, and other teacher made resources.   Additionally, all classrooms will be print rich and students  will be explicitly taught to interact with one another through questioning and using academic vocabulary.         4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?    We will administer the Spanish LAB for newly identified Spanish speaking students.   The Spanish LAB is administered to all  new entrants in grades K to 2 whose HLIS responses indicate a home language of Spanish and who are newly identified as ELLs  based on NYSITELL results. It is administered throughout the year as necessary. The Spanish LAB is used to support  instructional planning in providing  ENL services to these students.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    11X483 is a K-2 school that opened on 9/9/15.    As such, we do not expect having  the following ELL Subgroups; SIFE,  Developing and Long Term.  For our Newcomer ELL's language and vocabulary development will be supported with  visuals.  Opportunities for listening, speaking, reading, and writing will be embedded into the curriculum.  Small group  instruction will support our ELL students.  When necessary tier II and tier III interventions will be utilized. Former ELL students  will be given the required 90 minutes of ENL services per week and the appropriate testing accommodations  needed.  Accommodations can include extended time. separate location, re-reading, bilingual dictionaries, etc.. based on  need.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?    Teachers of ELL-SWDs will utilize the SIOP Model, explicit instruction, modeling and strategic, scaffolded activities to  accelerate English language development.  Visual supports will be utilized during whole class instruction.  Small group work will  be differentiated to meet the individual needs of all students including ELL-SWDs. Grade level materials include Fundations, Go  Math!, Teacher's College Reading and Writing Units of Study, Guided Reading Books, Fiction & Non-Fiction Independent Books,  Poems, Articles, Charts, Rubrics, & teacher made resources.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Curriculum is designed with all students in mind.  Scaffolds and supports are planned with identified misconceptions ahead of  the delivery of instruction.  Teachers revise and edit curriculum based on student outcomes.  All ELL-SWDs have individual  goals that are monitored by the classroom teacher and support teacher. The ENL teacher and Special education teacherl work  to support the language development of the students in the least restrictive environment.  Small group instruction within the  classroom provides a structure for students to be grouped according to specific skills or strategies in need.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   The Matilda Avenue School                                                                              School DBN: 11X483  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      We use written communication via email and also text messages using the remind system. The Interpretation Hotline  would be contacted in the event of an emergency to inform non-English speaking parents. Spanish/English speaking  staff members and parents that speak Arabic/English are also utilized in emergency situations.             Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      All staff members are made aware of our school wide policies and resources available during our beginning of the year  staff faculty conference. Both Principal and Our Language Access Coordinator provide professional development to  staff on what resources are available to assist staff with providing translation and interpretation services for families  that need it. The Language Access Handbook for schools is distributed and reviewed to ensure that all staff members  are aware of how to access the necessary resources including the translation unit and interpretation hot line and  services . As new students register, staff is made aware of parent preference if the language they wish to receive  communication in is other than English.          Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      During the registration process when parents are identified as non-English speaking, they will be informed of the  resources available to help them communicate with school staff. Information regarding translation and interpretation  services will be posted at the main entrance security desk and in the main office.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive.
