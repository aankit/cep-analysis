This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   PS 197 Kings Highway Academy Mission Statement:   Section 4: CEP Overview      At PS 197, we strive to create a secure and nurturing learning environment for all children and staff.

Focusing on the  cooperative partnership of school and home, in educating children, we, together, strive to promote peace, discipline,  and learning. We seek to generate and implement rules and logical consequences, to teach conflict resolution,  decision making skills, responsibility and independence. Based upon a belief that all children can achieve high   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      standards of excellence, we seek to implement a rigorous curriculum that provides opportunities for learning basic  skills through independent and cooperative learning activities. We emphasize the development of critical thinking and  problem solving skills along with the use of modern technology. We invite and encourage cultural arts and  extracurricular activities for our school. We welcome and encourage the participation of parents and the school  community in the teaching and learning process and in school events.      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    PS 197 has citywide Gifted and Talented Program in grades K through 4 along with a schoolwide scholars class in  grade 5. We have four full-time pre-k classes. We also have integrated collaborative teaching and self contained  special education classes on each grade to meet the needs of our students with IEPs.    We offer music, art, dance, science, technology and physical education. Our curriculum supports critical thinking and  inquiry based learning to foster independence and higher order thinking skills. Our classes participate in instrumental  and choral music instruction along with music appreciation. Each year our technology specialist works with classes on  the Lego Robotics program. Students learn problem solving skills through hands on learning. Our Visual Arts specialist  puts on two art exhibitions a year. Families have the opportunity to browse through the work of during the two  evening performances. Every grade participated in a dance program provided by The Arts Connection. This is a DOE  arts residency program.    PS 197 puts on many performances where the students have the opportunity to sing, dance and act on stage. We  have a winter show in December and the spring gala in May. We also have student of the month assemblies where  classes have the chance to perform either about an upcoming holiday or event.   As part of our sustainability initiative we have created a community garden that won the 2015 Golden Apple Award  from the DSNY. This garden promotes active engagement with the entire school community from pre-k through 5 and  the parents. We also have implemented a rigorous recycling program building wide. This has increased student  engagement and building a sense of community.   Our school also participates in many community service activities such as Jump Rope for Heart, Saint Judes Hospital,  and others. This gives students the opportunities to raise money to help others. Students also learn about the  importance of staying active through exercise.    PS 197 has many family nights where parents and other family members have the opportunity to take part in the  school community. Some examples are: international food festival, game night, movie night, parents as art partners  and reading and math parent workshops.    We have a variety of after school programs throughout the year. New York Junior Tennis League and the Midwood  Fee for Service programs are available for grades PK-5. We have received a grant to collaborate with Urban Arts  Partnership for an after school program with enrichment in Dance and home work help. We use ELL funds to organize  a Saturday Academy program for enrichment such as arts, athletics and technology and test prep.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   We have a growing number of English Language Learners. Classroom teachers are working closely with our ENL  (English New Language) teachers to develop a toolbox of strategies to support our community of ENLs.       4.

In June 2016, according to the New York State Mathematics exam, the number of students who scored Levels 3 or 4  was 50.2%.   In June 2017, according to the New York State Mathematics exam, the number of students who scored Levels 3 or 4  was 53.3%.   This is a 3.1 % increase.      School strengths:   Students can form discussions based on their mathematical thinking and problem solving.  Students know how to use scaffolds to build independence in mathematics         Teachers receive Mathematics Professional Development from Metamorphosis, where they examine ways to   enhance the Go Math program and incorporate open ended questions.   School needs:     The importance of planning in relation to the big ideas that allow students to really focus on deep   mathematical thinking;     How essential it is to let the students validate each other; they need to own the math;     The importance of finding productive struggle in a lesson;     Letting students own the mathematics of a lesson, as teachers we are there to question and guide, not to  provide steps to follow;     The importance of developing students’ ability to communicate their mathematical thinking, students should   create work that can speak for itself.     Although the school as a whole saw an increase of 3.1 %, grade 4 students showed a decrease from 46% in   2016, to 41% in 2017. We therefore, need to focus on grade 4 mathematics instruction.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S 197 The Kings Highway Academy, in compliance with the Section 1118 of  Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent  involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the  families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision- making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School  Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of  the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   P.S. 197 will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before October 31 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Meeting where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;   Staff members will conduct parent workshops regularly throughout the year on timely topics for the grade levels.            The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

The program will start as an enrichment program for our ELLs and former ELLs in areas  of physical education, the arts, health, and the humanities.  We believe this enrichment will give  our ELLs the time and space to form new and stronger bonds with their peers, utilize and  develop their skills, and learn new extracurricular activities in a more intimate setting.  Later on  in the 20 sessions, test preparation will be included into the program in addition to the  enrichment portion.  All instruction will be done in English.  We plan to invite our second, third,  fourth, and fifth grade ELLs and former ELLs.  Letters in the parents’ preferred languages will  be sent home.  We will use our multilingual staff as translation support.  Daily attendance will be  taken at the beginning of each session.  One common-branch certified teacher will be designated  to each grade level.  One ENL certified teacher will be present.  This totals to five teachers.A  combination of NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, ELA, and Math exam scores will be taken into  consideration for this program, in addition to classroom teacher and ENL teacher  recommendations.  Additionally, an ELL Social Club after school program will include two ENL  teachers and two content teachers to give 1st and 2nd grade ELLs the opportunity to  acquire English through play and project building.  There will be 45 sessions starting in  November 2018, about 2-3 sessions per week on Wednesdays through  Fridays.  This after school program will start at 2:20pm and end at 3:50pm.  Again,  all instruction will be in English.  Materials will be purchased for both programs.  All materials purchased for these two programs  are purely supplemental and separate from the ELLs’ daily, mandated instruction.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  To guide instructional planning for our ELLs, we use different kinds of formative assessments suggested and provided by the  Teachers’ College reading and Writing Project of Columbia University (TCRWP): Goal setting, Student observations, self and  peer assessment, and student record keeping. Goal setting is based on the student work or classroom tests to determine  where students are and where they have to be. Student  observations assist teachers in gathering evidence of our ELLs’  learning to inform instructional planning.  The evidence gained during students’ observation is used to take an action in the  form of scaffolding or feedback to support  ELLs’ language or subject matter learning. Self and peer assessment  involves  students in their learning  to see each other as resources for understanding and checking for quality work. Student ongoing  record keeping   helps students see where they started and the progress they are making toward the learning goal.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      Formative assessment practice allows teachers to monitor students’ learning so that they may adjust instruction accordingly,  provide students with timely and useful feedback, and encourage students to reflect on their own thinking and learning. To  support this effort, we work with our colleagues across the grade level  or multiple grade levels to create a year-long plan,  monthly units of study which is shared through Google Docs, where we can change and add to the plans together. During  planning, we take into consideration our ELLs’ reading level, past or outside school experience with reading and writing,  stamina, parents’ educational background, SIFE status, language proficiency level, number of years in ENL, disability, country of  origin, economic status.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  To identify baseline, progress and areas of need we use the following summative assessments: NYSITELL-to identify students  who are entitled to English as a New Language programs; NYSESLAT-to measure student progress in developing English  language proficiency;  ELL Periodic assessment results-to determine the strengths and needs of ELLs in their acquisition of  English Language skills;   ELA, Math and Science test results-to measure student progress toward New York State standards in  English Language arts, mathematics and science.  Summative assessment helps evaluate the effectiveness of programs, school  improvement goals, alignment of curriculum, or student’s placement in specific programs.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    As a result of summative assessment, we make instructional adjustments and interventions during the learning process.  Teachers use different features of classroom scaffolding that enable ELLs to develop their full potential and eventually become  autonomous learners.  Providing supportive environment helps ELLs feel safe and supported to explore ideas and take risks, it  also helps ELLs feel comfortable collaborating with others, listening to others, and being listened to attentively; during  scaffolding  teachers respond to the needs of their ELLs at a given moment to support them in their next level of  learning;  once  the student becomes more capable, the teacher hands over more autonomy to the learner as the learner  progresses.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   The staff at P.S. 197 looks at the ELL’s number of years in ENL, their literacy level in English and their native language,  understanding of content areas, socio-emotional needs, results of the NYSESLAT, parental involvement, SIFE status, and all  samples of the student’s work.  Our school uses different screening tools to identify students who are not meeting  benchmarks, such a standardized tests, language assessment tools in English and native languages, informal interesting with  the student, parent, and teachers.  As a result, differentiated instructions are used to meet the diverse needs of all  students.  Differentiated instruction considers student’s English proficiency, prior educational experience, the amount and  type of ENL instruction, the impact of language and culture on instruction and learning, ensuring that the languages used for  intervention matches the language used for core instruction.  When evaluating instructional programs, the results of  instruction is compared to results for “true peers” to decide whether the students is responding to intervention or needs more  intensive intervention.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   To evaluate and inform of our ELL programs we generate the EDAT using information from the RLAT, RNMR and the RESI.  The  main dashboard of the EDAT generates the assessment data of the NYSESLAT, NYSITELL, ELA and math assessment data, ect.  Using the   EDAT we can monitor SIFE status, progression and regression of the NYSESLAT, ELA and math status, holdover, and  long term ELL status.Our ELL team uses the state language proficiency data from  NYSITELL and NYSESLAT to understand  where ELLs are along the continuum of language development and how to provide appropriate scaffolds for them according to  their proficiency  level.  Based on the ELLs proficiency level, ELLs receive a specified amount of standalone ENL and integrated  ENL.  The standalone ENL instruction is delivered by the certified ENL teacher, Integrated ENL instruction is delivered by the  dually certified teacher or by ENL teacher’s coteaching with a content area teacher. As for former ELLS, They receive 90  minutes of integrated ENL after testing out.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   We adjust instruction to meet the cultural, linguistic, academic, social and emotional needs of our diverse students. We  integrate language and content instructions collaborate with the classroom and content area teachers to promote academic  achievement of our ELLS, use instructional resources that are linguistically, age/grade appropriate, and aligned to Common  Core Learning Standards. ELLS with disabilities are provided with high-quality instructional and support services in alignment  with their IEPs and current policies.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Three fully licensed ENL teachers teach their ELLs via a Standalone and Integrated ENL program model.  While  pushing-in, we support the targeted group of ELLs working on the learning material in collaboration with the  classroom teacher.  An ENL teacher works with ELLs during content instruction and provides acquisition and  vocabulary support while retaining instruction tie in their mainstream classroom.  A pull-out model is used for the  structured instruction of ELLs from one or more classes in a separate location.  ELLs are grouped both  heterogeneously (mixed language proficiency levels) and homogeneously (when the English language proficiency level  is the same).  The latter is often used when grouping newcomers who are at the preproduction level of language  development.  ENL teachers always plan carefully with general education teachers to ensure curricular alignment.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Not applicable.    c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Not applicable.       2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Our school will ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency level in each  program model. Based on the number of ELLs on each level, our school will calculate ENL teacher need using the metric posted  on DOE’s website and adjust the hiring practices to meet all mandates while providing students with a high quality educational  program that addresses our students’ academic and linguistic needs. Beginning September 2015, there are 5 proficiency levels  for ELLs based on the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT. CR Part 54-2 provides the chart how to breakdown total number of minutes in  ENL. Entering students will receive 360 minutes; 180 minutes will be standalone ENL and remaining 180 minutes will be  integrated ENL/ELA. Emerging students 180 minutes integrated ENL/ELA, 90 minutes Standalone ENL, 90 minutes are flexible  standalone ENL or integrated. Transitioning students have 90 minutes mandated integrated ENL/ELA and another 90 minutes  are flexible. Advanced ones  are getting  180 minutes integrated  ENL and Commanding ones are getting 90 minutes of  integrated ENL. ENL teachers will create a schedule;  Copies of the schedules will be provided to the teachers and  administrators, and will be posted on the classroom doors.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      English language learners are held to the same high expectation outlined in the CCLS. The standards state that “it is possible to  meet the standards of speaking, listening, reading, and writing without displaying native-like control of conventions and  vocabulary.”(Standards for English Language Arts and Literacy in History/Social studies, Science, and Technical  Subjects/introduction.)  ENL strategies and learning materials used are aligned to CCLS and reflect the shift in ELA/Literacy evident in the CCLS.  Activities in content areas are scaffolded to increase complexity and rigor. Questions are text-based, academic vocabulary is  present in all the materials. Students are required to write from many different prompts. Progress assessment is ongoing, both  formally and informally.  Content area instruction is provided to all ELLs.  The students are grouped according to their English language proficiency level,  language development, and academic needs to address their weaknesses and strengths effectively.  The instructional  approach used to teach literacy to ELLs is based on Balanced Literacy which means developing literacy skills by incorporating a  number of activities, including read-alouds, shared reading, guided reading, independent reading, interactive reading, phonics,  spelling, shared writing, guided writing, modeled writing, interactive writing, and independent writing.  ENL strategies are used  to provide ELLs with the educational tools of communicate in social settings, achieve academically in all content areas, and in  socially and culturally appropriate ways.  All students are receiving their mandated services.  ENL strategies and learning  materials used are aligned with NYS Standards.  Progress assessment is ongoing, both formally and informally.  Instructional  shifts deem that there will be a stronger emphasis on Informational Reading and Writing.  Therefore, P.S. 197 has strived to  make informational texts and highlight in the literacy workshop.  There is a Science teacher and a Social Studies teacher who  either push in or pull out whole classes, which is supplemented by field trips appropriate to their grade level and the topics  previously covered that school year thusfar.  Bilingual and monolingual picture dictionaries are available to the students, which  are organized by topic or theme, such as numbers, family members, feelings/emotions, etc.  ESL teachers balance between  English structures and content-specific vocabulary throughout their instruction of math, social studies, language arts, and  science.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   ELLs are evaluated only in English; they are not evaluated in their native language because the school provides only the  Freestanding ENL program at this time.  However, our ELLs are provided native language support via our bilingual and trilingual  staff, mainly in Spanish and Russian.  The school library has a collection of books for ELLs both in English and their native  languages.  Students are taught to use glossaries, bilingual dictionaries, and technology to enhance their independent learning.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a.     SIFE  i.     SIFE student require rigorous early literacy instruction in conjunction with oral proficiency skills.  SIFE students are typically  behind their peers in general and basic academic skills.  Therefore, the alphabet and phonetic skills are targeted first.  Listening  skills are critical to their language acquisition.  Minimal pairs are a great technique to see how carefully they can hear and  separate phonemes.  Digraphs and blends are used afterwards.  Storytelling is a strong instructional method to get SIFE  students used to listening to others and re-create their own stories.  All four modalities must be addressed as any other sub- group.  The main aspect that differs a SIFE student from any other mainstream student is the lack of literacy skills.  b.     Newcomer   .     Newcomers receive the most support out of all the students.  Instruction is designed based off of the diagnostic tools such  as AMAO, the previous year’s NYSESLAT, the NYSITELL, and TC assessments.  Newcomers receive the highest level of  scaffolding.  Vocabulary words are introduced strategically based on importance to the text.  Then, grammatical structures are  covered through the texts.  Newcomers are assessed formally and informally throughout the year.  Targets are adjusted  accordingly based on instructional need.  Newcomers receive interpretation services for non-ELA tests for the first two years  upon entry.  These students often work with a partner to improve their oral communication skills.  Games, pictures,  manipulatives, modelling, songs, and videos are all great realia to get ELLs to make connections with language and the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      meaning.  c.     Developing   .     Most ELLs test out of ENL after 3 years, but for students that receive services for 4-6 years are given concentrated  instruction in content areas and advanced reading and writing skills.  ELLs that do not test out of ENL after 3 years, sometimes  lack academic skills such as focusing, self-help strategies, and independence.  These skills keep the student from performing  well in both ENL class, on tests, and in their mainstream class.  In these cases, the classroom teachers seek RtI for these ELLs  before they are possibly referred for Special Education evaluation.  ENL teachers use content area materials -- that are on  grade level -- and adapt them to this subgroup.  Some of our ELLs come from families that travel back to their home countries  on a regular basis.  This can set back the children’s language acquisition process when they return to New York.  Additionally,  our Advanced ELLs often need extra attention with the skills of retelling, inferencing, providing details, using context clues, and  critically reading informational texts.  Teaching these students to read as writers and write as readers is key.  Learning to write  expressively for their own personal enjoyment is a strategy to have these students write with more interest and passion.    d.     Long Term   .     Although P.S. 197 does not have any students with more than 6 years of service, the ENL teachers would target the ELL's  more advanced and complex skills in content areas.  The ELL would be in the upper grades, having been in ENL services for so  long.  Therefore, listening to speeches about historical moments, reading primary documents and comparing perspectives  would force the ELL to connect all four components of their language acquisition.  Channeling content and vocabulary through  so many mediums, will enrich the ELLs ability to use more diverse, varied, and higher leveled language.  e.     Former ELLs   .     All subgroups of ELLs have certain common needs that must be addressed, including those who recently tested  out.  Former ELLs receive accommodations and 2 years of integrated ENL services after they score as Commanding  Level.  Former ELLs receive time and a half for the NY Common Core ELA and Math tests for the next two years after they  tested as proficient, as well as bilingual glossaries/dictionaries.  In many cases, the former ELLs may be less proficient in their  reading and writing skills than their mainstream classmates.  Classroom teachers will notice if the reading and writing support  is necessary and will put them in the respective reading or writing small groups.  Former ELLs still need to expand their  vocabulary, practice and experiment with using a variety of complex sentence structures, and use complex literacy skills to  approach native-like language development.  The Common Core Learning Standards guide the teachers in the former ELLs  achievement.  When former ELLs fulfill these standards, they are on par with their native-speaking peers.se to questions  here:        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Particular consideration is given to identifying students in need of improvement and students with special needs.  An Individual  Education Plan (IEP) is in place for all Special Education ELL students.instruction is organized around task and learning  groups.  All teachers who serve Special Education ELLs have the required qualifications and language competences.   At P.S. 197, we serve 16 ELLs who are also students with disabilities (SWDs), 3 of them receiving ENL services for 4-6 years and  the remaining 16 are receiving 0-3 years.  All ELL-SWDs use grade-level materials to provide access to academic content areas  and accelerate English language development.  The grade and the instructional goals are indicated in the Individual Education  Plan (IEP) of every ELL-SWD.  The instructional strategies are similar to those used for general education students.  Scaffolding  is one of the ways to meet their needs.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  ELL-SWDs are either part of the CTT classes, which usually have one general education teacher, one special education teacher,  and a teacher assistant, or study in self-contained special education classes, which have one special education teacher and two  or more teacher assistants.  ENL teachers work in collaboration with the teachers and staff serving ELL-SWDs.  They teach them  via a Stand Alone and Integrated ENL program model.  At our school, we have one CTT class and one self-containing special  education class on every grade.  The latter usually contains ELL-SWDs belonging to two consecutive grades.  All  accommodations for ELL-SWDs are determined by a team of teachers including special education teachers, content area  teachers, and ENL teachers.  All accommodations, such as the extended time, translation of test items in the student’s   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      language for content area test, etc. are consistent with day-to-day instructional methods and are never first introduced during  this testing.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Each of the three ENL teachers provide services to one grade band each.  One teacher has Kindergarten and First Grade,  another has Second and Third Grade, and the last has Fourth and Fifth Grade.  From there, the three ENL teachers use a  combination of standalone and integrated instruction to satisfy all required instructional time.  All classroom teachers'  schedules were gathered and coordinated so that an appropriate schedule could be made to see all children at times that  would not interfere with their content area classes.  The ENL instruction is delivered through small group instruction with a  focus on English language objectives, while emphasizing reading and writing strategies.  Several classes are usually served  during the day.  The number of ENL instructional units that a student receives is regulated by New York State CR Part 154  regulations and determined by student English proficiency levels as per the NYSITELL and / or NYSESLAT scores.  Entering and  Emerging ELLs are mandated to receive 360 minutes of ENL instruction per week; transitioning and expanding students are  mandated to get 180 minutes of ENL instruction per week, and commanding ELLs are mandated to receive 90 minutes per  week for 2 years after exiting or scoring out with a passing NYSESLAT score; all ELLs are mandated to receive 180 minutes of  ELA instruction per week.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Based on data trends, P.S. 197 has implemented new programs into this academic year.  We now have a yearly subscription to  Imagine Learning, which is used for supplemental instruction and data tracking for our newcomer ELLs and ELLs with special  needs.  Imagine Learning has been a great asset to the classroom teachers by providing scaffolded instruction based on  diagnostic and formative assessments.  We have also initiated an after school program using Title III funds in order to promote  healthy social interactions between our ELLs.  Our ELL Social Club was very successful in boosting ELLs’ confidence and their  oral language skills.  Additionally, we also have residency partnerships with Urban Arts, Making Books Sing, and Materials for  the Arts through our acquired Arts for ELLs/SWD grant.  These programs are providing during the day and after school  instruction for our ELLs, SWDs, and mainstream students by integrating art into academic skills such as storytelling,  conservation, and teamwork.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?  P.S. 197 is not discontinuing any of its current programs this year.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All ELL are afforded equal access to all school programs, including after school and supplemental services.  ELLs receive  targeted instruction via after school programs.  We are planning several after school academic programs for our students in  grades 3-5.  They will be scheduled on Tuesdays and Wednesdays beginning in February and continuing until the ELA and Math  examinations.  Midwood Development After School Program is a community-based program housed in our school.  This  program provides homework assistance, physical education, and arts / crafts.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Our ELLs are taught how to use glossaries, bilingual dictionaries, and technology to enhance their learning.  All required  services support our ELLs at different levels of their language development.  An ENL teacher provides integrated ENL support  to all student groups with ENL students in the after school programs.  The classrooms are equipped with the smartboards,  which are regularly used to support the instructional materials for language arts and math.  The materials and resources used  are age and grade appropriate.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   The school library has a collection of books for ELLs both in English and their native languages.  Students are taught to use  glossaries, bilingual dictionaries, and technology to enhance their independent learning.   Our Freestanding ENL program   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         provides native language support via our bilingual and trilingual staff in Spanish, Russian, Arabic, Haitian-Creole, Albanian, and  Georgian.  Furthermore, children widely use bilingual dictionaries and glossaries in math, science, and language arts.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Required services and support correspond to ELLs' ages and grade levels.  This is accomplished through continual articulation  with classroom teachers.  Books are leveled A through Z and they are available between the two ENL classrooms.  The ENL  teachers are aware of student levels and use material accordingly.  The mainstream teacher, speech therapist, and RtI teacher  is aware of their levels and appropriate materials are used.  This includes students who are at the third grade reading and  writing levels but are in the fifth grade because of their age.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    The 2017-2018 school year will be the first year that P.S. 197 will no longer be co-located with I.S. 381.  Because our school is  expanding so quickly, P.S. 197 will now be the only school at this location.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Before registration, our parent coordinator happily guides the parents or guardians through the schools for a tour of where  their child will go for each subject and grade level.  Our parent coordinator is able to give this tour both in English and in  Russian, for our large Russian speaking population.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    There are no language electives offered at this elementary school.          18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Not applicable     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Our ENL personnel includes three K-12 ESL-certified teachers.  They participate in meetings and workshops offered by the  Office of ELLs.  Workshops are conducted during the school year in the areas of literacy, math, science, and ENL.  These are  conducted by our ENL teachers, literacy coach, principal, and assistant principal.      The Professional Development time that we are provided with on Mondays is used for teachers to turnkey PDs they have  been to, unit plan for grade levels, collaborate with vertical teams based on subject, and provide various PDs to teachers based  on common struggles in the classroom.  To guide ENL teachers with common core support for ELLs, staff developers from Teacher's College come to P.S. 197 about  twice a month to fine tune the teachers' techniques and lesson focuses in reading, writing, and social studies. The entire staff  team has faculty conferences about once a month where CCLS and Framework for Great Schools are discussed and explored to  further support all students, including ELLs.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59         2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Professional development for ENL teachers, classroom non-ENL teachers, and teacher assistants includes challenges and  strategies associated with teaching ELLs.  They are: New York State - LEP identification process; English proficiency levels of  ELLs; essential elements of effective program models for ELLs; ENL methodologies and description of classroom practices;  second language acquisition; instructional scaffolding used with ELLs; the critical components of reading instruction for ELLs,  etc.  ELL support specialists as well as professors of the City University of New York (CUNY) are invited to provide professional  training, as needed.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Throughout the school year, the ENL teachers make arrangements to meet with parents via letters, phone calls, emails, and in  person in order to discuss our short term and long term goals for the child.  NYSESLAT scores are discussed with the parents,  and we answer any questions they may have about what the results mean for their child.  This involves their language  proficiency and what they will need to achieve in order to progress to the next levels of language proficiency.  We also discuss  what we will do with them throughout the year, what their glows and grows are, and what will be expected of them for  formative assessments in all their subject areas, including ENL. Parents are offered translated letters as well as in person  translation interpreters from staff members at P.S. 197.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   To promote family engagement, families with children who were beginner, intermediate and advanced ELLs attended  workshops presented by Urban Arts to “Support Literacy in an ESL Household.”  Our school also hosts various events in order  to inform parents and highlight student’s work, such as Common Core Workshop, ELA Test Prep Workshops, Grade 5 parent  workshops to support parents for middle school decision, Family Literacy Nights where teachers demonstrate helpful tips for  parents who struggle with assisting their children in reading.            Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Rosemarie Barbiere Nicoletti, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and  activities are adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Kings Highway Academy                                                                              School DBN: 22K197  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      To assess language preference of our school’s parent community for both written and oral communication, the  Language Access Coordinator (LAC) tracks the language preferences of all parents in the school community.  Written and oral language preference data is collected via the following forms: 1. Student Registration Form- completed by the school at the initial admissions 2. Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)- completed by all parents at the initial enrollment of their children at school. 3. Emergency Contact Card (Blue  Card) - completed by all parents at the beginning of every school year. Our school also uses a School Level Adult  Preferred Language Report(RAPL). Parents' preferred languages for communication gets updated throughout the  year as a new student enrolls at our school.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63      To update parent's preferred language by individual students our Language Access Coordinator uses the Update  Parent/Adult Info (PARU) screen in ATS. As for updating parent's preferred language by grade level or official class,  our school uses the Update Parent's Languages (UPPG) screen in ATS. Throughout the year, our Language Access  Coordinator regularly generates and reviews up-to-date ATS reports which indicate preferred languages for  parents in our school community.           2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community.

Translated versions of this document in the covered languages are  available at http://schools.nyc.gov/RulesPolicies/ParentBillofRights/default.htm   Our school will post signs in the conspicuous location at or near the primary entrance in five covered languages  needed in our school, Russian, Spanish, Urdu, Arabic, Chinese, indicating the availability of interpretation service. Our  school staff is familiar with the Over-the-phone interpretation services. Language Identification Cards are displayed at  every entry point of the school.This card facilitates the language identification process by instructing LEP parents to  identify the language from a list of translated instructions.   Safety plan of P.S. 197 will contain procedures for ensuring that parents in need of language access services are not  prevented from reaching the school's administrative office solely due to language barriers.           Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?

Letters on the website in 9 languages inform them about the services  available at school. Parents can use the telephone number on the letter to share their opinions about the translation  service at school. Furthermore, on the same website parents can click on online feedback form and send a  confidential message to the chancellor.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66
