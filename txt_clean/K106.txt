The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7     In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           8       NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           10      Section 4: SCEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   At Edward Everett Hale Elementary our mission is to work in collaboration with students, families, and the community  to provide a nurturing environment committed to achieving excellence. We foster academic achievement where each  child is presented with a solid foundation of skills, knowledge, and values. This framework will enable the scholar to  become a well-rounded, college and career ready productive member in an ever changing world.      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   The Edward E. Hale School P.S. 106, is an elementary school nestled in the Northern part of the Bushwick community  in Brooklyn. It is a community who prides and celebrates the beauty of its diversity. Composed of a rich cultural  ensemble that reflects many cultures, beliefs and customs which makes our community quite unique and rich in  character. Our culturally diverse population is comprised of various ethnic groups, with an increasing rate of  immigrant groups from various countries such as Mexico, Ecuador, Dominican Republic, Honduras and Yemen.      Throughout the past five years, the community has undergone changes that have affected student registration across  School District 32. As the community undergoes gentrification, student enrollment has decreased. P.S 106, currently  houses a total of 430 students from pre-kindergarten through grade 5. The school embodies 12% Black, 85% Hispanic,  2% White, and 2% other students. Out of our 430 students, 33.33% are classified as English Language Learners (ELLs),  27.27% are students with disabilities and over 90% live below the poverty level. The average attendance rate for the  school year 2017 - 2018 was 91.6%.       The scholars at P.S. 106 partake in State and City approved curricula which include programs such as GoMath,  Passports, CS4ALL, Allgebra4All, Fundations and Reading Streets. In collaboration with the COMPASS program (a CBO  housed in our school), we aim to develop well-rounded individuals. Our students are afforded the opportunity to take  part in social and emotional developmental programs and activities. Through the Tiger Leaders, our students build  citizenship and leadership skills as they learn and collaborate with peers. The scholars are encouraged to participate in  democratic decision-making for the larger student body on their grade. Tiger Leaders facilitate the organization and  execution of the Fifth Grade Graduation, Field Day, Red Carpet Day, and Spirit Days. Behavioral incentive programs,  such as the Boys and Girls Basketball Program are bridging social gaps between age groups, gender roles, language  and cultural barriers. Our Art Club, bridges families, staff, former students and current scholars in exploring various  art forms and mural making. As a result, the school’s collaborative efforts promote a thriving and productive school  culture for students and adults, as noted in the decreasing number of incidents and suspensions.       We will continue to strengthen rigorous instruction through collaborative teams, Professional Development and data  analysis. This year, our primary grade teachers were engaged in norming the results of the Fountas and Pinell  benchmark assessment as well as full implementation of the Fundations system. As the teachers analyzed assessment  data, fluency was determined to be an area of need. Our Literacy Coach supported the development of fluency  lessons that promoted coherency and impacted student learning as well as teacher instruction.          3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           11      Out of our 430 students, 33.33% are classified as English Language Learners (ELLs), 27% are students with disabilities.  The ELL population is rapidly growing. While the majority of our ELLs' meet educational standards and expectations in  our Bilingual classes, some demonstrate diverse needs, other than the attainment of the English language. About 5%  of these students have not received prior educational instruction. We currently have two Bilingual Special Education  classes.

As per the 2017 NYC DOE School Performance Dash Board, Edward Everrett Hale Elementary School rated 3.56 in  Effective School Leadership and 3.55 in the Trust domain of the Framework for great schools.       This year, we have established leadership teams, grade leaders, and the Ambassador group who are charged with  various leadership roles that encompasses instructional, social-emotional and development of positive school culture.       We have established systematic feedback meetings for articulation. Supervisors use the Danielson Framework for  Teaching to establish clear expectations for classroom practice and support teacher development. Teachers receive  timely feedback that highlights strengths, identifies challenges and provides next steps to promote professional  growth and improve classroom practice. Grade level teams as well as small group and individual planning sessions  help meet the specific needs of new teachers.    Based on teacher surveys conducted in September, Professional Development workshop series’ were organized to  meet teachers needs that included analyzing data to design data- driven instruction and integrating technology into  our classrooms. Through this forum, the staff has expressed they feel safe in sharing their needs and feel supported  by the Administration...Thus, building on Trust.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           44      and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           45      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Edward Everett Hale Elementary-Public School 106 , in compliance with the  Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a  parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and  the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and  decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the  School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed  members of the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Edward Everett Hale Elementary-Public School 106 will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           46      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           47      ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.             2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           48   School-Parent Compact (SPC)      School-Parent Compact (SPC)       Edward Everett Hale Elementary-Public School 106, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of  student achievement between the school and the families.

There are 541 students of which 142 or almost 26% are English Language  Learners.  (These statistics are as of the most recent submission of the LAP).  Most of our  English Language Learners are also immigrants--the majority coming from Spanish speaking  countries and a few coming from Haiti and Arabic speaking countries.  We house two types of  services for our English Language Learners--Transitional Bilingual Classes ,one per grade,  two  special education classes (12:1:1)  k, 1, and 2 bridge) and a bridge 3,4, and 5). We also offer Free  Standing ENL in accordance with CR Part 154 and Title III.  There is one ENL teacher who  services entitled students whose parents choose ENL as the instructional program for their  children, students with special needs whose IEPs indicate the need for ENL service and ELLs  whose L1 is other than Spanish and whose parents refused the transfer option or where there is  no transfer option available.  The ENL teacher uses a Pull-out/Push-in model.  All bilingual and  ENL teachers are fully certified. An analysis of our data shows the needs to focus on reading and  writing domains for ELLs.  We plan  to use Title III funds to strengthen our education for  ELLs  in Transitional Bilingual classes by providing strong rigorous instruction in reading and writing  in L2 in alignment with the Common Core Standards including building strong content  knowledge, building independence so that our students can comprehend and evaluate complex  texts across content areas, articulating ideas, and acquire Tier III vocabulary in L2.  We will also  use Title III funds in after school programs to serve as a platform for providing extra enrichment  in English language practice through math and literacy instruction, while creating a supportive  forum where our TB ELL students can interact and share knowledge of customs, culture and  language.  *Subgroups and grade levels of students to be served:  Our After School classes will serve TBE ELLs in grades  2-5.  It will also serve ENL ELLS in grade 1 and 2.  *Schedule and Duration:  The After School program will commence on January 9, 2019 and run through April 25, 2019,  for a total of 28 sessions, 2 days per week, 2  hours per day.

These assessments  measure a variety of skills — both  in decoding and comprehension.  It also informs students' progress in sight word recognition, spelling, sound-symbol  relationship, reading with fluency and writing.  We use this data to inform instruction and define our learning targets and short  term goals.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The teachers are provided with common meeting times.  The teacher common planning time allows for analyzing data,  creating long and short term goals.       3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?     To evaluate the success of our ELLs, we look at several assessments — standardized ELA, Math, Science and Social Studies  tests, NYSESLAT results — how many students moved up a level, periodic, interim and “Mock” tests to see growth,  informal  assessments — Running Records, teacher made tests, parent-teacher conferences and meetings, the School Report  Card, the Parent/Teacher Surveys, student participation in after school,  articulation with cluster teachers and all service  providers to see how the students are doing.  The information we get from this  evaluations provides the data to evaluate our  program for our ELLs.        4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    The  data is compared and aligned to the learning goals.  Students not meeting goals are provided with small group instruction  as well as push-in/pull-out services.  Student goals are created and both summative and formative  assessments   are used to  measure growth.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Our school uses data such as NYSESLAT, ELA, Math, NYSITELL and periodic assessment to determine which Tier of Instructional  support to provide our ELLs. First, a universal screening is given when the student first enters the school system.  This  screening which consist of an interview with parent, NYSITELL and LAB( Spanish speaking students) are used to guide  instruction for ELLS. Theses assessments are used to establish a baseline of student performance. Those students who fall in  Tier II and Tier III  are enrolled in the extended day. Eighty percent of our ELLS participate in our extended day tutorial  program. The extended day tutorial program consist of students in Tier II and III who are our targeted students. They are part  of the Inquiry Team Population where students are provided with  core instruction tailored to their needs and are monitor to  assess progress in targeted skills.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].       The data above indicates that ELLs tend to master listening and speaking before they master reading and writing.  Reading,  considered to be one of the receptive aspects of language and writing, considered to be one of the expressive aspects remain  a challenge for our students. Many of our ELLs received a “P” in listening and speaking but did not test out due to the  reading/writing.  This is a clear indicator that there is a need to increase explicit ESL instruction throughout the grade levels to  provide ELLs with the tools necessary to navigate the language through deep structure, text patterns and genre so that the  ELLs will be better equipped to navigate language through persuasion, editorializing, debating and the other supra segmental  features of the language correctly.  In  analyzing  the data, one can see that the challenge arises once the students have to read and write on their own.  This is in  line with what research states, “Learners hear more language, a greater variety of language and have more language directed       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           62         toward them …” (Gibbons, p. 17).  It is significant that most of the ELLs in this category fall in the middle indicating a need to  broaden the language teaching to challenge and push our ELLs ahead through scaffolding and strategies that will help them  navigate the L2.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?  There is a minimum of one common planning time provided for grade teachers and two period per week for vertical  planning.  During vertical planning meetings and Professional Development on Monday, Bilingual and ENL teachers have the  opportunity to examine data, plan for instruction, design strategies  and tools  to build proficiency   in language development.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.                  Instruction in the Freestanding ENL program is organized using a push-in/pull out model.  During the push-in  model the ENL teacher co-teaches with the classroom teacher and provides the extra scaffolds and support needed by  the ELLs to master the deep structure and vocabulary of L2.  While the ELLs may have different proficiency levels, the  students are grouped accordingly.  During the pull-out model the ENL teacher works with ELLs across proficiency  levels in small groups to foster higher linguistic knowledge in order to create critical thinking skills. She groups  according to proficiency levels as well as grade level.                     The school staff has a clear vision that includes high expectations for ELLS supported by a plan of action.  Teacher  monitors ELLs progress by analyzing data. Teacher are then able to individualize students needs and provide  scaffolding strategies and differentiated  instruction. Collaboration and planning among teachers during inquiry team  meetings takes place to ensure that students needs are met. Curriculum and instruction  are delivered and aligned to  the CCSS to help students master skills needed. Parents are informed through P.A. meetings, letters and progress  reports on school instructional focus and how they can help their child succeed.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.                      Instruction in the Transitional Bilingual Classes is organized using the self-contained model.  There is one  bilingual class from 1-3. Also we have one Transitional Bilingual bridge class 4/ 5. There are two additional bilingual  classes serving special needs’ ELLs in a 12:1:1 model k-2 and 3-5.  The classes move as a block for different cluster  periods.  The classes are organized heterogeneously since we do not have enough students to form an additional  bilingual class per grade or on contiguous grades.In the Transitional Bilingual Classes the student home language is  used to help students progress academically in all content areas. The amount of English increase over time but there  will be home language instruction to support the language development of English.     c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Instruction in Dual Language program seek to offer our students the opportunity to become bilingual, biliterate and  bicultural while improving their academic ability in two languages. At our school this year we implementing  a Two  Way Dual Language Program in Kindergarten that includes both native English speakers and ELLs. The teacher provide  instruction in both English and Spanish. Our goal is for the students to develop literacy and language proficiency in  English and in the home /target language. The major objectives of this program are having a successful forum for  addressing the language and academic needs of English learners and having an opportunity for other students to gain  a world class education that instills the promise of more independent world       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           63         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?                       In our Transitional  Bilingual classes the bilingual teacher provides the mandated number of instructional minutes  according to proficiency levels obtained by NYSESLAT and in accordance with CR Part 154 for ENL, ELA and HLA.  Since our  bilingual classes are organized across proficiency levels, the teachers use differentiated instruction to provide the mandated  number of ENL/ELA to each entitled student.  According to CR Part 154, bilingual teachers provide one unit of study in Native  Language Arts (180 minutes) per week; two units of ENL for Beginner and Intermediate students as evidenced by the  NYSESLAT for ELLs in grades one through five and the LAB-R for ELLs in kindergarten or those without NYSESLAT scores; and  one unit of study of ENL and one unit of study of English Language Arts for Advanced students.  The Content Area Instruction is  provided in the native language following our program model (60-40, 50-50, 25-75) except for Social Studies which is  conducted in English using scaffolding techniques such as thinking maps, mapping, cognates, and so forth.   In our  Two Way Dual Language program we  have the 50/50 model. In a 50/50 model, the instructional day throughout the  elementary years is always 50 percent English and 50 percent the minority language. Careful consideration in curriculum  planning is done to alternate the language of instruction of content areas so that students become equally versed in math,  science and social studies in both languages. Language arts for each language also is taught while paying strict attention to the  different methods used in teaching literacy in different languages. The program focused on core academic curriculum, include  high quality language arts instruction in both languages with use of thematic units. In our Dual Language kindergarten class we  have complete separation of the two languages without use of translation or repeated lessons and we use interactive and  collaborative teaching strategies.             The ENL teacher provides all targeted ELLs in the Free Standing ENL program with the mandated number of units of study  (two units of study) for the Beginner and Intermediate level students as per NYSESLAT and/or LAB-R assessments as well as  one unit of study of ENL and one unit of study of ELA to the advanced population of ELLs.  Our ENL teacher also uses  differentiated instruction to provide the linguistic needs of the entitled ENL students.  Our librarian who also has a Bilingual  Common Branch license provides additional instruction  to students in bilingual as well as Free Standing ESL classes to support  the students needs in language. Content area instruction is provided by the mainstream classroom teacher using ENL  methodologies to provide a learning classroom environment in which our ELLs can effectively acquire academic content  knowledge.  In addition, the ENL teacher parallels her instruction with the unit of study in Science/Social Studies followed by  the classroom teacher.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.               In our Transitional Bilingual classes (Spanish) content areas (Math, Science and Social Studies) are delivered in the native  language using a 60-40 model.   In this way the content is comprehensible to all of the students and helps them transition to  the 50-50 model around January.  The bilingual teachers take one content (Social Studies since this content can be broken  down using manipulatives - maps, thinking maps, use of prior knowledge etc.)) to help ELLs start to navigate content area  vocabulary and structures.  Teachers use charts, thinking maps, projects, performance tasks,  use of smart boards, technology,  cooperative learning, peer tutoring, games, field trips, differentiated instruction and other proven methodologies to enrich the  language development of L1 and prepare their students to move to the 50-50 model and then the 30-70 model by March    In our Dual Language class the language- minority students build their native language proficiency, which in the long run  strengthens their acquisition of the English. English speakers develop proficiency in a new language, and their English skills are  strenghted  by this additional cognitive process. They maintain use of English , so their English skills do not diminish during the       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           64      time they are immersed in the new language, and their English school achievement eventually outperforms that of native  English speakers who have been schooled in English-only instruction.               In our Freestanding ENL program content areas (Math, Science and Social Studies) are delivered in English by the  classroom teacher using pictures, thinking maps, charts , computers, baskets of books in the students’ native languages, peer  buddies performance tasks, performance tasks, smart boards, technology, and other proven methods to make content  comprehensible to enrich language development.  The ENL teacher provides support to the ELLs in content area using word  banks, charts, Venn Diagrams, labels, games, graphic representation, QAR, and other proven methods to scaffold the language  to make content more comprehensible and enrich language development.  While the cluster teachers provide instruction in  English to both bilingual classes and monolingual classes where there are ELLs, these teachers provide language rich/print  rich  enviroment  that help ELLs manipulate the higher language and structures needed in the content areas.  Our cluster  teachers have been provided with staff development in L2 strategies to foster deep structure and higher vocabulary--figurative  language, idiomatic expressions, multi-meaning words and so forth.  Our music teacher provides activities in rhyming, lyrics,  and songs/poetry that helps ELLs in listening and speaking.  Our social studies/science cluster has attended Q-TEL workshops.          4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?               There are several tools used to evaluate ELLs in their native language (at P.S. 106 ELLs who are Spanish speaking and  receiving bilingual instruction are evaluated in Spanish).  The initial identification is done using the HLIS.  The answers are  verified and analyzed by the ESL teacher.  Once a potential ELL is identified and screened as  elegible  for testing, the ELL  student (Spanish speaking) is given the Spanish LAB as a form of language dominance.  Once placed in the bilingual classes, the  ELLs are given  'Calles" baseline and unit assessments in Spanish. Informal tests in the content areas,  and common core  performance task are also used across the grades to evaluate native language throughout the year. The inquiry teams targeted  students are given informal assessment in Native Language according to targeted skills. At the end of the school year students  in bilingual classes in grades 3-5 receive the ELE.  Data is analyzed and instruction driven according to students' weaknesses.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status       a. Describe your instructional plan for SIFE.           Our instructional plan for SIFE students include support in L1. Teachers have a " Estrellita Kit" in the bilingual classroom for  thoses students in 3-5 grade who cannot read in native language. For those SIFE students reading strategies are done in the  native language using Estrellita, sight words, penmanship, individualized instruction, letter formation, breaking words down  into syllables, matching beginning sounds to the picture,  and other pre-reading strategies.  For SIFE students in the  Freestanding ENL program there is support in the L1 using baskets of books purchased.  In addition all SIFE students receive  support from our technology teacher using a special decoding and comprehension program called "My On." The classroom as  well as cluster teachers (expecially our writing and literacy teachers) provide differentiated instruction in beginning reading  and writing strategies.  The ENL teacher provides some multicultural lessons and material on American culture.  These  students also form our inquiry target population.  Finally they are encouraged to attend the extended day program where  further instruction is given, as well after-school .        b. Describe your plan for ELLs in US schools less than three years (newcomers).       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           65         For our newcomers (0-3 years) we offer the Transitional Bilingual Program (Spanish) and use the 60-40 model especially for the  first four months of entry into our school. We follow the curriculum per grade as well as the mandated number of units of ENL  and Native Language.  Content area exams are given in the native language.  For the newcomers who are not in transitional  bilingual classes, the ENL teacher provides the mandated number of units of ENL and confers with classroom teachers to help  provide the content area in English using concrete and abstract objects, thinking maps, cooperative learning, summarizing, K- W-L maps, games, small group activities, role-play, field trips and a cadre of strategies to foster content area vocabulary and  comprehensible input and output. Also, the newcomers are taken LEAP Arts for ELLs program. This program provides  quality  educational art program to promote access and equity for our students. through artistic inquiry and expression we are  providing our ELLs and newcomers a path to be more engaged in learning, building their creativity, collaboration,  communication, and critical thinking skills. This program will enhance the creative expression of our students but also will help  them master academic content. The program will run from November 7, 2018 through April 2, 2018 twice a week. students  from grades 2-3-4-5 will be participating in this program.        In addition, since NCLB now requires ELA testing for ELLs after one year, all of our cluster teachers that impact on ELLs provide  differentiated instruction for them targeting vocabulary and deep structure to foster higher critical thinking skills.  The cluster  teachers along with the classroom teachers provide  reading comprehension and vocabulary development using context clues,  flowcharts, synonyms/antonyms, and multi -meaning words, to help this population of students move on to the next  level.   This population of students is provided with strategies to find key words and phrases to answer reading comprehension  questions.  The ENL teacher prepares her population of newcomers here for one year or more concentrating on reading  comprehension strategies—the five “Ws”, key words, vocabulary development.  She confers with the classroom teachers and  offers scaffolding techniques to the ELLs as well as offer suggestions to the classroom teachers that they can use to help the  ELLs in their classes.  The ELLs in both bilingual and Free Standing ENL. ELLs who will be tested after one year are also provided  with ELA strategies and given one period of ELA along with the ENL periods.  ENL strategies for ELA are also incorporated  throughout the day. This population of ELLs are also provided  with and encouraged to participate in  the extended day and  afterschool programs.     c. Describe your plan for ELLs receiving service 4 to 6 years.          For our ELLs receiving service 4-6 years, we provide differentiated instruction emphasizing reading and writing strategies  across content areas.  These students also receive extra periods of AIS from the clusters.  All of our cluster teachers and out of  classroom personnel attend weekly inquiry team meetings; hence, they are aware of the target population and are part of the  discussions of Best Teaching Practices for ELLs.  This is part of our on-going, in house staff development.    This population of  ELLs is encouraged to attend our  afterschool  programs — especially the one that specifically targets ELLs in grades 3-5. The  ENL teacher promotes reading and writing through a variety of strategies that emphasize vocabulary and language structure —  word banks, context clues, content dictation and many others.       d. Describe your plan for Long-Term ELLs (completed 6 years).          ELLs are entitled to bilingual/ESL services until they test out of the NYSESLAT. This year we have no long term ELLs  (completed 6 years).  Nevertheless, for those ELLs who fall under this category, we provide instruction using a SIOP type model  to foster the language needed to move on to higher learning.  The classroom teachers, along with the clusters and out of  classroom personnel (ENL teacher, SETTS, Speech teacher)  use a variety of visuals — flow charts, circle maps, bubble maps ,  and many others to help this population break down the language into comprehensible input.  They also use captioning so that  this population can see the relationship of main idea and details.  Our cluster teachers who impact on classes where there is  this population differentiate instruction using material from multiple sources that target reading and writing.  The ENL teacher  provides many opportunities for reading and writing using strategies such as context clues, outline note, semantic feature  analysis, reading for a specific purpose and note taking to facilitate higher forms of linguistic development. This population  also receives services from our inquiry team where these students are part of the target population.These students are also  encouraged to attend after school.          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           66      e.  Describe your plan for former ELLS up to 2 years after exiting ELL status.             Our plan for continuing transitional support is to place former ELLs in the grade appropriate monolingual classroom  where our Freestanding ENL students receive services.  The classroom teacher has been trained in ENL strategies and uses  these strategies to foster the academic as well as social language needed to be successful in school.  The ENL teacher  continues to monitor the level of the former ELLs and continues to provide technical assistance to the classroom teacher as  well as all other teachers who impact on these students.  These students also receive services from the AIS cluster teachers.              Our continuing transitional support includes 90 minutes per week of ENL services and compliance with the testing  accommodations for ELLs who have reached proficiency on the NYSESLAT for two years.  These accommodations include:     * Time Extension, Separate Location, Bilingual glossaries and dictionaries, simultaneous use of English and alternative  language editions of the exam.         6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?        The IEP teacher ensures that ALL teachers and related service providers  receive a hard copy and/or digital access to ELL  SWD's IEPs.  At the beginning of the school year teachers and related service providers meet in their PLC's to discuss  scheduling of services and accommodations to be provided to ELL SWDs and sign the required Chapter 408  acknowledging  that they have been made aware of student and their IEP.    The instructional strategies and grade -level material used to access academic content and accelerate English language  development are parallel to their general education peers.  Teachers and service providers use pictures, graphic organizers,  charts with realia, computers, baskets of books in the students’ native languages, peer buddies performance tasks,  performance tasks, smart boards, technology,  and other proven methods to make content comprehensible to enrich language  development.  The teacher and providers support the student in the acquisition of language and content using word banks,  charts, Venn Diagrams, labels, games, graphic representation, QAR, and other proven methods to scaffold the language to  make content more comprehensible and enrich language development.  Students are provided with extended time to  complete tasks given.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?             Our school uses curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to meet the diverse needs of ELL-SWDs as follows:  All  ELL-SWDs parallel their general education peers in curricular and instructional materials.  The materials are adapted and  modified as per the linguistic needs of this population. While the school focus may be on a specific unit of study (e.g. Writing  Realistic Fiction), our ELL students have flexibility to use peer tutoring, shared writing, modeling and other forms to produce  the desired writing piece.  Our ELL-SWDs also use graphic organizers, technology, the use of the smart board and other forms  of manipulatives (computer) to foster the writing piece.  In addition, the assessments are often modified so that the ELL-SWDs  have more time; hence scheduling flexibility is achieved and our students do not feel frustrated if they cannot complete the  task.  They can complete the task since their time can be extended.  Our ELL-SWDs participate in different school wide  activities with non-disabled peers (trips, holiday celebrations, inter-class visitations, assembly performances and shows,  Heritage month celebrations, art, school spirit days--Halloween Parade, Pajama Day, Flag Day).  Flexible scheduling also takes  place via mainstreaming of ELLs-SWDs with non-disabled peers as per IEP stipulation.        8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.          Our targeted intervention programs in ELA, Math and other content areas are open to all ELL subgroups.  We have an after  school program that begins in January and run through May. The program is held on Wednesdays and Thursday from 2:30 to       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           67      4:30 pm.The program provides ELA, Math, Science and Social Studies practice to prepare students for the NY state exams.  Students who are in a Transitional Bilingual Class receive Math and Science instruction in Spanish.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?        For the upcomming school year we will continue to  implement a tutoring program for ELLS on Wednesday and Thursday that  focuses on skill building and strategies needed need by ELLS in grades 3-5 to move up on the NYSESLAT exams.  Also this year  we have a new core curriculum science program from grades K to 5 called Science Amplified. Science Amplified Program is a  program that inspired students to think like scientist and allow students to visualize scientific phenomena.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   No programs or services will be discontinued.        11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.     ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs .They participate in all school activities and afterschool. They also  participate in different students clubs like dance club, art club, Run Runners and basketball teams.    The after school and supplemetal services offered to ELLs takes place on Wednesday's and Thursday's from 2:30 to  4:30.  Students receive practice opportunites to develop the skills required to be successful in all 4 domains fo the  NYSELAT  (Reading, Writing, Speaking and Listening).  The classroom teacher provides students with the after school letters to  be signed and returned to school for participation in the ELL program.        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.          All ELLs, regardless of subgroup receive the same materials. We have purchased On Our Way To English to encourage  reading and writing as well as listening and speaking.  There are computers  in the bilingual classrooms equal to those in  monolingual classes.  Ells attend the computer LAB.   We also have a state of the art library complete with computers and  research material.  Our librarian is a licensed bilingual teacher and is available to all students who need to use the library for  research.  She is available to offer additional scaffolds to our ELL population. Technology is  available all around the school.  Teachers have smartboards in their classroom and desktop computers to use in the classroom. They also have rolling labs of  laptops computers so students can use them all at once.       13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?           Native language support is provided in the Transitional Bilingual Program via the nature of the class. There are literature and  chapter books in Spanish in our transitional bilingual classes.  There is also  native language support (Spanish) is delivered by  the teachers through Reading Streets in Spanish, Science Amplified in Spanish,  independent leveled readers and  Estrellita.  Students have Spanish-English dictionaries, glossaries with content area specialized vocabulary, resources such as  globes (Spanish), a writing resource (Spanish). Our library also stocks many books in Spanish. Our Dual language program  students have access to the standards and resources that will enable them to develop skills in both languages. the program  address language standards in both languages as well as content standards appropriate to the grade level. During the 50%  English portion the Reading Street program is been used. During the 50 % instructional part of the day we using  Estrellita.  Native language support is provided in the ENL program as baskets of literature books and dictionaries have been  purchased in the languages present at our school.  This material is housed in the monolingual classes where there are ELLs as  well as in the ESL classroom. Ells have access to dictionaries, glossaries, and leveled readers in the languages present at our  school.        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           68              All required services support and resources correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels using differentiated instructional  strategies, the Intervention  component of "Reading Street" the use of technology in the classroom, "My On," and the use of  running records to access and drive individual instruction.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?            All ELLs, regardless of subgroup receive the same materials.  We use a Newcomers’ Kit—On Our Way to English for all new  arrivals.  In addition, we have purchased Spotlight on Literacy to encourage reading and writing as well as listening and  speaking.  There are computers in the bilingual classrooms equal to those in monolingual classes.  Ells attend the computer  LAB.   We also have a state of the art library complete with computers and research material.  Our librarian is a licensed  bilingual teacher and is available to all students who need to use the library for research.  She is available to offer additional  scaffolds to our ELL population. Technology is  available all around the school. Teachers have smartboards in their classroom  and desktop computers to use in the classroom. They also have rolling labs of laptops computers so students can use them all  at once.       16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).           Before the beginning of the school year, newly enrolled ELL students are given a tour of the school with their parents and  observe our bilingual classes as well as our monolingual classes.  They speak to the teachers, look around and get an  orientation of the school, our programs, testing schedules, expectations, school goals and see the video on the different  programs offered.  Our principal also speaks to the students and parents and highlights special projects offered such as th Cook  Shop , Green Big theatre,LEAP program and Resume  Writing Workshop.        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    N/A       18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   Our school has a Two Way self - contained Dual Language program. We implementing a 50/50 model,the  instructional day is always 50 % English and 50 % Spanish. Careful considerations in curriculum planning is  done to alternate the language of instruction of content areas so that the students become equally  versed in math, science and social studies in English and Spanish. Language Arts for English and Spanish  also is taught while paying strict attention to the different methods used in teaching literacy in different  languages.For example, Spanish literacy has traditionally been based on a very systematic sequence of  learning vowels, syllables, and then syllables combines into meaningful word units. English in the other  hand, is typically learned through  a phonological approach where individual letters are sounded out to  decode the given word. The dual language provide access to develop skills in both languages as well as  content standards appropriate to each level. Program balance language by dividing instructional time       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           69         based on content area.In the dual language class the teacher maintain separation of the language no  translation. the skills taught in each language are coordinated to maximize cross-linguistic  transfer and  support in the content areas.     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?         Our professional development plan for all personnel who impact on our ELLs (classroom teachers, paraprofessionals,  guidance counselor, special education teachers, occupational/physical therapist), speech therapist, secretaries, SAPIS worker,  IEP teacher, clusters)  includes on-going workshops on strategies and skills needed by ELLs to promote language  development.  Professional development on ELL strategies are given during Professional Development time on Mondays  afternoon. Some of our staff also attend professional development outside of the school and the professional development  Saturday Academy. All of our literacy and math workshops presented by the Staff Developer and data specialist also address  the needs of ELLs.  The Staff Developer, data specialist and ENL teacher demonstrate strategies to promote L2.  There is also  professional development provided by companies who conduct workshops on instructional materials for ELLs. During the  Inquiry Team meetings professional development is provided at the school on Best Practices  and Common Core State  Standards (CCSS) that correlate to the ENL standards and regulations of CR Part 154.  In addition, the Bilingual Department have vertical meetings twice a month.The meetings are on fridays from 1:30- 2:20.

The administrative staff at our  school (Principal and  assistant principals) hold bilingual licenses and conduct professional development needed by the staff  who impact on our ELL population.  In addition, our school psychologist and social worker also hold bilingual licenses and  provide professional development on psychological and social needs of our ELL population.  Finally, professional development  for staff who impact on our ELL population is provided by the Network Professional Development.            2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.   As ELLs transition from elementary to middle school, they attend an orientation session at the middle school where middle  school personnel meet and explain the school, goals, expectations and so forth.  In addition, the ENL teacher sends out a  memo to each Assistant Principal in charge of Bilingual/ENL programs at the end of the school year with a list of ELLs who will  attend that school and the type of program they received here.  In this way there is a continuum of services for each ELL and  an easy transition from elementary to middle school.  We also assure that all parent letters are placed in the cumulative record  of the ELLs.  In addition, the contact person from each middle school visits P.S. 106 in the Spring and explain programs and the  expectations of each middle school.  Finally, our students, including the ELLs have the opportunity to visit nearby middle       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           70         schools prior to graduation.              The professional hours as per CR Part 154.2 are provided through a series of workshops of ELL training for all staff where  mandates are shown, strategies are demonstrated and modeled, the pedagogical staff looks at different testing instruments,  including the NYSESLAT, program models are discussed and a cadre of strategies are suggested to help ELLs master L2. Theses  workshops will take place twice a month on Mondays PD sessions.  It is our commitment at P.S. 106 to provide professional development for teachers and other staff responsible for the delivery  of instruction and services to Limited English Proficient students.   The Professional Development program will focus on  providing teachers with scaffolding and differentiated instructional strategies for teaching ELLS. It will also focus on modeling  strategies on how to prepare ELLs to meet and exceed the NYC and NYS Performances and Common Core State Standards  and  how to achieve higher scores on all city and state assessments. Facilitators for the professional development sessions will  include school administrators, Network personnel,  ENL teacher, the data specialist, staff developer, IEP teacher, and the  librarian.     Agendas and signed attendance sheets are maintained and stored in a folder by the Assistant Principal as well as the facilitator  of each PD session.           Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   The ENL, IEP teacher and Libarian hold annual meetings with parents of ELLS to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress , language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas on  Tuesdays afternoon during Parent Engagement Time. Theses meetings takes place on the second Tuesday of the month. Topics  of workshops include language development and assessments ELLS will take during the year. The classroom teacher also meets  with parents on an individual basis to inform parents of students needs and progress and inform parents on how to help their  child at home. In addition, our Parent Coordinator,  meets with parents on a regular basis and provides  workshops and  technical assistance to parents. The meetings are held in English and Spanish.   For other languages we use the DOE Language and translation interpretation services.        2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.             Our parental involvement includes different aspects.  We have a Parent Association which meets monthly; in addition,  there is a parental involvement as part of our School Leadership Team which apprises parents of curriculum, budget and  school projects.  There are also workshops held monthly on different topics including Breast Cancer Awareness, Asthma,  Discipline and bullying, Nutrition, Stress and Domestic Violence. We  offer Zumba classes, My hero and I Dance activity, The  Cook Shop, Sip and Paint program to build a sense of community and build a bridge between school members and  parents.  Our parent coordinator meets with parents on an individual basis to discuss specific parent concerns, offers  information on housing, and help parents fill out forms for students transitioning to the middle school.  .  All information is  provided in the language of the parent whether it is written or spoken. Our Parent Coordinator also refers parents to  community organizations (for example Ridgewood /Bushwick) depending upon the concern and need of the parent.   *               2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           71      Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Magaly Moncayo, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.            2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           73                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Edward Everett Hale                                                                              School DBN: 32K106  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

Yes/No       (*Primary)             * The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs  on translation,   interpretation, compliance and budget.      School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      The data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written and  oral communication include collecting data via the following forms:    *student Registration Form    *HLIS    *Emergency Contact Card(Blue Card)        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           75      *ATS Reports( RCPL,RAPL,RCON),etc.    At P.S. 106, our main languages are English and Spanish with a few students speaking Hatian Creole and  Arabic.This information was obtained from the RHLA report in ATS.We also use information obtained from the  HLIS. There are two questions on the HLIS (Part 3--Parent Information) which asks parents in which language they  would like to receive written information; and in which language they would perfer to communicate orally with  staff. We use the data collected from this information to assess our school's written and oral interpretation needs.  We also look at the RPOB to assess the languages spoken in our school. Furthermore, we review the data in our  LAP to verify languages spoken in our school. We look at agendas, parents’ notification letters, parents attending  PTA meetings, Parent Coordinators logs, Parent/Teacher Conference attendance sheets,parent teas, after school,  evening and Saturday activities attendance and ENL attendance sheets to assess who attends our activities.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     Written Preferred    Percent Written          Oral Preferred    Percent Oral          Language    A review of the data  indicates that our largest  language group for which  translation and oral  interpretation exists is  Spanish. We also have a  few Arabic speaking  parents as well as a few  Haitian Creole speakers.  The findings are reported  to the school community  at Leadership Committee  meetings, faculty  conferences, to all  personnel dealing with  parents (Parent  Coordinator, Attendance  personnel, School Based  Support Team,  Secretaries, SAPIS worker,  Teachers and so forth).                       3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.                 2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           76     Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services    1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be   distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.      Document Name    Month/Frequency Distributed to   How do you plan to translate?   Families    Include procedures to ensure timely  provision of translated documents      to parents.       At PS 106, we disseminate document  such as parent monthly calender,  parent handbook wich we disseminate  at the beginning of the year,New York  Testing dates etc. We do in-house  written translations and use  community personnel as the need  arises.
