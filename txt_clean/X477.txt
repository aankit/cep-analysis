This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   MISSION STATEMENT   Section 4: CEP Overview      The mission of Marble Hill School for International Studies is to develop in each student the necessary skills to acquire  and apply knowledge. Students are provided with a social, emotional and physical environment that is nurturing,  supportive, intellectually challenging and conducive to learning. Students are empowered to become self-directed,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      lifelong learners inspired by their personal quest for an understanding of themselves and the global society in which  they live.             2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   Marble Hill is a college preparatory school and therefore has additional academic requirements to ensure all students  graduate college ready. Students take 4 years of Math and Science, 3 years of Foreign Language *, 4 years of Advisory,  and a one-semester College Readiness class in the first semester of senior year. Classes are an hour long and students  receive additional instructional time in Math and History in the 9 th and 10 th grades. English Language Learners (ELL)  students receive additional English instruction based on their English level. All students complete a minimum of 100  hours of Community Service over the course of their high school career. In the 11 th and 12 th grade students can  take 1-3 AP courses per year (US History, English Literature, English Language, Statistics, Biology, Spanish Language,  Spanish Literature).    *ELL students may receive foreign language credit based on their language of instruction in their home country and  the age they came to this country.   School Partnerships:   ● New Visions and the Affinity Group - our chosen public service provider that supports our staff with professional  development in and outside of the school and data tools.   ● The DreamYard Project – provides residencies in visual art, drama, and dance to our 9 th and 10 th grade students,  once a week on Wednesdays. They also have a drama community service group that writes and produces their own  plays on student issues which they present in middle and elementary schools as well as a Saturday program at the  center in the south Bronx, which a few of our students participate in regularly. For the past three years, we also  participated in the International Poetry Exchange Project that was started by DreamYard and Ambassador Kennedy.  Our students have competed against students in Japan, South Korea and the Philippines via video six times a year as  well as during trips to Japan and South Korea. This year we will travel to Japan again and in addition to having the  Poetry Boxing, we will also meet Mrs. Abe, the First Lady of Japan.    ● IMentor - We have partnered with Marble Hill since the fall of 2013 and provides every incoming 9 th grade student  a mentor that follows them for four years. Weekly communication with the mentors happens during class time with  the support of a IMentor staff member and Marble Hill teacher. IMentor will recruit, check and train every mentor  and provide a staff member per each grade for 2.5 days a week to support the program which includes planning and  presenting the weekly lessons to all students in the grade, following up with students and mentors to ensure they are  communicating via email weekly and planning and leading the monthly mentor events at our school. Program  Managers also coordinate and collaborate with our CBI College Advisor around college and career awareness and staff  around academic and emotional needs of students.    ● CBI – College Bound Initiative – provides a 12 month college adviser that works to create college awareness across  all grades and guides students through the entire college application process as well as prepares students for  enrollment in the college of their choice. The CBI adviser also conducts workshops for parents and teachers on all  elements of the college process.      DreamYard Project - Arts partner since 2002. They have provided arts residencies in fine art, dance, drama,  and music production to our 9th and 10th graders and arts electives at times to our upper class men when  grant funding has permitted. They also included us in the International Poetry Project in 2014 and our   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      students have participated in annual poetry competitions with students from Japan, the Philippines, and  South Korea.    ● Lehman College Now Program – they have provided College Now courses for juniors and seniors as well as summer  programs for our rising 10th and 11th graders.    ● CUNY LINCT to Success Collaborative Program– since the fall of 2012, we have participated in this program which  trains our College English teacher to prepare seniors who have not achieved the CUNY entrance requirements in the  ELA Regents, for the CUNY COMPASS entrance exams. Seniors take a College English course, get two opportunities to  take and pass the exam, a tour of a CUNY school, and free class materials while our 12th grade ELA teacher receives  ongoing professional development over the course of the year.    ● SEO - Mentoring program that accepts 9th graders based on merit and family income.

We have conducted 9 student and teacher exchanges with 2-8 students from each school, 2 teachers, and  an administrator from our school and their students then visit our school for a week and stay with our students while  attending Marble Hill classes.                3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Special Populations:   ● ELL – 30%, 139 students   ● Special Ed - 13%, 61 students   ● SIFE (Students with Interrupted Formal Education) students are 14% of our population, 61 students   Marble Hill School for International Studies diverse student body is comprised of over 30 languages and 40 countries,  servicing students that come from all over the Bronx and parts of upper Manhattan.    English Language Learners and SIFE students need academically rich language instruction in all subjects and learn  English through content in all grades. Double blocks of English are provided to ELL students in 9th - 12th grades and  9th and 10th Grade Global teachers are dual certified in TESOL and History to address the heavy linguistic demands of  the Global curriculum. Additional tutoring after school and on Saturday's is also necessary and encouraged for our ELL  and SIFE students.    For our students with disabilities, a content and special education teacher are in their four core subjects of English,  Math, Science and History and they often have only 1-2 different special education teachers through the course of   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      their day too so that these teachers get to know them and their learning needs and styles very well. These Special  Education teachers provide testing accommodations and work with their co-teachers to modify, supplement and  support students and ensure the content is accessible to all of the SWDs in the room. Resource room is required for  some students and additional tutoring after school and on Saturday's is also necessary and encouraged for our SWD's.  Counselling, speech, mobility para's and OT or PT are required for others. We also have some students that receive  busing to and from school and we ensure they have time to receive study and receive tutoring after school as much as  possible.    For all of our high needs students teachers create language rich tasks and use project based assessment and oral  portfolio assessments that require students to use language in all modalities to describe their learning across all  content areas. We also use scantron to assess English and Math levels and growth over the course of the year.   Our guiding mission is to ensure that all students are given the opportunity to learn about the world first hand from  their peers and teachers, in a nurturing and challenging academic environment. We promote students engaging in the  world through project based learning, second language acquisition, Advanced Placement and College Now  coursework, community service, extracurricular activities, field trips, and international travel and exchanges.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The greatest progress was made in the Framework Element of Collaborative Teachers during the 2017-2018 school  year. Teachers met in teams two times a week to work on projects and literacy. Additionally the PD team  comprised of a teacher from every department, developed a PD plan that incorporated department, grade time  and professional learning teams around teacher chosen topics. Through the teacher teams and the PD structure,  teacher collaboration increased greatly. Looking at the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide our teachers scored higher  than the borough and city on the following responses:     96% of teachers said that teachers at our school actively try to improve their teaching, (12% higher than the   borough)     89% said that they design instructional programs together (5% higher than the borough)     100% say they talk with one another about instruction (4% higher than the borough)    86% of teachers said they had opportunities to work productively with colleagues at their school on PD (1%   higher than the borough)      100% of teachers aid that they recommend our school to families seeking a place for a child and to other   teachers as a place to work. (20- 21% higher than the borough)    Key Areas of Focus for 2018-2019 School Year will be around around Supportive Environment and establishing a  classroom and school culture where students with IEP's feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and  peers.   Our Special Education Department and Guidance will review all IEP's and share with content teachers to ensure  that appropriate IEP's are developed for every student. Content and Special Education Teachers and  Paraprofessionals will work together on the classroom format, activities and lessons; adapting the instruction to  each student's need to ensure that the lessons are comprehensive and rigorous for all students. For teachers who  have students with IEP's and teach the class alone, administration and the special education team will support the  teachers to ensure they are also servicing their students with IEP's appropriately.    Through our differentiated PD program teachers will collaborate with grade, department and mixed groups by  teacher chosen focus around problems of practice. Special Education will be the focus of PD for all teachers, once a  marking period.    Another key area of focus is Rigorous Instruction. Our Algebra teachers and Special Education teams will focus on  working with our SWD's to improve their outcomes on the Common Core Algebra Regents for our 9th, 11th and 12th   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         grade students with IEP's who have not yet taken or passed this regents to increase the average score by at least 5%  from last years average score of 65 to 68 by June 2019.             2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 10X477   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   437   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     SCHOOL STRENGTHS & ACCOMPLISHMENTS:    ● Committed staff: We have a 96% teacher retention rate this year with one teacher going on sabbatical, one coming  back from sabbatical and another returning from family leave. Our teachers are extremely dedicated to our students  and the majority have spent 3-15 years working at Marble Hill SIS. Likewise the administration, guidance and support  staff have also worked at the school for 9- 16 years and work together very collaboratively. This commitment leads to  a high degree of trust (Excellent at 4.43, .98% higher than the borough average) and collaboration among our  teachers, administrators and support staff that translates into strong connections with students and families.    ● We had a high annual attendance rate of 93% for 2017-2018.    ● Strong college-going culture that is supported by College Bound Initiative, IMentor, parents, students, teachers and  the school program. Our school graduation requirements demand our students complete 4 years of Math and  Science, and 3 years of foreign language for mainstream students, and 110 hours of community service. We also have  built up our AP course offerings to cover at least one AP in each department. OUr College Readiness index has  increased from 55% in 2014 to 72%    ● We reached the excellent level in most areas of the School Quality snapshot for 2017-2018 school year, increasing  from a 2.78 to 3.90 in Strong Family Community Ties.    ● We have a very strong project-based assessment system that leads to a oral portfolio presentation at the end of  each semester for all students. We have had this project-based assessment system since we opened in 2002. This  rigorous system provides students with a meaningful way to use English to explain and defend what they have  learned in all their classes each semester, while also presenting a revised and edited project from each class.    ● We have developed and maintained strong partnerships with DreamYard, IMentor, and CBI that have lead to  greater enrichment opportunities for our students outside of school and in the summers that have included summer  college, International Poetry Exchange to Japan and South Korea, job shadowing and career exposure, college fairs,  Parent/Guardian presentations, Art shows and exhibits, and college process support throughout high school.    PRIORITY NEEDS:    While we have always served a large ELL population, our special education population has grown as well as the range  of levels and needs of this population of students in each grade. This year is the first year we have had an additional  ICT strand in the 9th grade, making it 2 out of our 4 strands in 9th grade have students with IEP's. This translates to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15      more of our teachers having an ICT class and/or have students with disabilities in their classrooms. This led to us  hiring an additional Special Education teacher, bringing our department to 5 special education teachers.    Additionally, per the NYC School Performance Dashboard, the 4-year graduation rate for our ELL's was 84% in 2018  (14% higher than comparison schools) compared to 75% for our SWD's (10% higher than than comparison schools).  While this is a drastic increase from 2017 when we were at 46% graduation rate of our SWD, compared to 61% for our  comparison schools; we need to continue to focus on improving our supports and instruction to better serve our  students with disabilities.    The Common Core Algebra Regents is the first and only regents all of our 9th grade students take and our SWD's have  had an average score of 65 for the past two years while our ELLs and whole school average was 69 in 2017-2018, a  drop from 73 for whole school and 71 for ELL's from 2016-2017 school year. Our average incoming proficiency levels  based on 8th grade scores is a 2.86 in Math compared to 2.94 in ELA. Math is a difficult subject for our higher needs  students.    Additionally, our teachers have expressed through PD surveys, the need for more support in serving students with  disabilities and developing productive co-teaching partnerships. One group of teachers that includes our special  education department and some content teachers, have also chosen to work on special education in their small group  PD time.    Our varied PD structure that included monthly Special Ed break out time by grade, is essential to meet this priority  focus as well as common planning during circular 6R time in teachers schedules.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   Our Math and Special Education teams will focus on working with our SWD's to improve their outcomes on the Common  Core Algebra Regents for our 9th, 11th and 12th grade students with IEP's who have not yet taken or passed this regents  to increase the average score by at least 5% from last years average score of 65 to 68 by June 2019.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          16     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and  strategies your school will implement to achieve the  identified goal for this Framework for Great Schools  element, including:   Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible  for implementation and oversight.  This goal was created after the SLT team comprised of parents, teachers, students and the principal reviewed our data  dashboard, school survey from last year and saw that our special education students under-peformed in most areas,  especially Math. Knowing the importance of the Math Regents in students meeting college readiness benchmarks,  this goal was set.    Progress made towards the goal will be shared out at Math and Special Ed Department, SLT and Cabinet meetings  over the course of the 2018-2019 school year. Students with disabilities in the Algebra courses and their parents will  be made aware of the content and skills covered on the Algebra CC regents, the importance of passing the Algebra CC  Regents to not just graduate but attain College Readiness levels to avoid remediation in college. They will also learn  about how remediation in Math and English can negatively impact a students college application process as well as  progress in college. Parents will be apprised of their child's progress through weekly parent outreach time, parent  educational conferences and parent/teacher afternoons/nights. The Math and Special Education teachers will  conduct parent outreach and talk with students weekly about their progress as well as guidance counselors will call  parents as needed. The Math and Speical Ed departments as well as SLT and administration will review the progress  towards the goals.               Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment   Part  4a.

The cabinet will also review the  progress monthly via feedback from teachers to their department representative on the cabinet as well as by  reviewing student class progress and marking period grades. At the end of the fall and spring term, the Algebra and  Special Education teachers will assess the impact of their work that term as well as a whole school sharing of this  feedback and discussion on how to improve the process for the spring term. Administration will discuss student  progress in Algebra during pre and post observations too.      Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. (e.g. Performance Series, January  Regents, etc.)  Student grades in Algebra that are comprised of: notebooks, class work, assessments and projects will be used to  assess student progress in comprehending the content that will be covered on the Algebra CC regents the students  will take in January 2019 (upper grade students) and/or June 2019 (9th grade and 11/12th grade students). Students  will do practice Regents questions as well as mock Regents too over the course of the year to assess their progress  towards passing the Regents.

What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  One of our strengths is our college going culture focused on academics. We require more academically of our  students to graduate (4 years of Math and Science, 3 years of Foreign Language, and 100 hours of community service)  than NY State requires for high school graduation. These high standards we have maintained for all our students are  strived for by our students, parents and teachers, creating a culture focused on    Now, due to:         changing school population and Increased special education population from 10 - 13% in last 4 years as well  as,  greater range of levels and needs in our special education population, from high functioning students with  autism to formerly self contained students, and students with mobility paras,    more limited tutoring supports we are able to provide outside of school, and     budget constraints;    we need to refocus our efforts on improving our services to our special education students throughout the school day  in our ICT classrooms which are now 25% of our classes, through our resource room and team-teaching models.    Special Education Statistics from New Visions Student Sorter:      53% of our Special ed population is in the schools lowest third.     20% did not earn 10+ credits in the previous year with 66% having failed 1-22 credits during high school    15% have a GPA ranging from 53-64%    27% have GPA from 65-69%    25% have GPA from 70-79%    50% are off - almost on track to graduation   Additionally, both content teachers and special education teachers overwhelmingly stressed in post observations and  mid and end-of year reflections that they needed additional time and support to work more effectively in the ICT  classrooms to support our students with IEP's.

Include  the  timeline  and  identify  key  personnel  and  stakeholders  responsible  for  implementation and oversight.  The SLT team, comprised of teachers, parents of students with IEP's, students and the principal reviewed the data  from the NYC dashboard, New Visions portal, and school survey and identified the lower pass rates of our students  with IEP's as an important area to focus on since credit accrual can prohibit a student from being promoted to the  next grade, lower their GPA and negatively impact the tragectory of student's high school career and possbilities to  continue their education after high school.    Our parents will meet with the special education teacher, content teachers, guidance and/or administration for their  annual or triannual to understand their child's progress from last year as well as the accommodations that are being  recommended for their child this year. Most of these meetings will happen between October and December 2018.    At all parent events, including the Parent Association and SLT meetings, services and needs of our students with IEP's  will always be highlighted and addressed to ensure all parents understand the needs of our special education  population. Teachers will also reach out to parents during Parent outreach time each week and meet with parents at  Parent/teacher conferences 3 times a year or more as needed.         Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment  Part 4a. Indicate resources you will leverage to achieve this annual goal and implement this action plan, including  human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc.  Through out weekly parent outreach and once a during PD time, all staff will have time to meet with their co-teachers  and receive PD around areas that impact our students with IEP's such co-teaching models and strategies, the Writing  Revolution, or how to create modifciations for students with IEP's for classwork and assessments.    All special education teachers will be kept at a regular program full-program, as opposed to having an additional class.  This will ensure that they all have 2 periods a day free to prep and meet with their co-teachers.

Our  other 9th grade special education teacher will mentor this teacher, as she has worked with the teachers and  curriculum of this grade for 3 years now.    Since few of our special education teachers have strong Math backgrounds, we have taken the one that is stronger in  Math and looped her to follow her previous 9th grade ICT class up to their 10th grade Geometry class. Likewise we  have one teacher who is stronger in the Global History curriculum, working with both one 9th grade global class and  one 10th grade global class.    Per session has also been set aside for special education teachers to finish IEP's, provide resource room help after  school (1.5 hours two times a week) and tutoring on Saturday's (3 hours a week) and meet with their co-teachers  after school hours (1-2 hours per week).    Special Education teachers will be sent to content area PD too to ensure they will be able to better support their  students in Math, Science and writing across the curriculum. Textbooks, online resources, and other resources like  manipulatives will be purchased to help support our students with IEP's throughout all their classes.      Part 4b.

They have the opportunity to participate in professional  development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement.      Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   School Strengths:     Committed staff: We have a 96% teacher retention rate this year with one teacher leaving for family leave.   Our teachers are extremely dedicated to our students and the majority have spent 5-13 years working at  Marble Hill SIS.    Per the 2017-2018 School Survey:     96% of teachers say that they usually look forward to each working day at their school. (Q4a)    100% of teachers say that they recommend their school to families seeking a place for their child. (Q4b), and    100% of teachers say that they recommend their school to other teachers as a place to work. (Q4h)   This commitment leads to a high degree of trust and collaboration among our teachers; as well as strong connections  between students and teachers as well as families.    Priority Needs:   Per the 2017-2018 School Survey results:   100%of teachers say that they talk with one another about instruction,(Q8d) but 85% of teachers say that at their  school teachers make a conscious effort to coordinate their teaching with instruction at other grade levels. (Q8b).   As we have a high retention rate and most of our teachers have worked together for a few to over 10 years, trust is  high among our teachers but time is never sufficient enough to allow for enough meeting time across all the various  groups from PD groups, Department, Grade, Cabinet and PD Teams weekly.    Our high-needs populations of special ed and ELL are shifting in make-up and increasing in percentages and more  people are and will be teaching students with IEP's in the near future. Additionally the state standards and  assessments continue to change teachers are facing new Regents exams they must prepare students for irregardless  of English level and student IEP's. We need to continue to adjust our classroom pedagogy and assessments to address  these shifting state standards and assessments, student populations and their individual needs.    Our weekly meeting times need to be as productive as possible to ensure each team is meeting their yearly goals and  impacting student performance positively. Through our varied PD schedule, all teachers will choose a problem of  practice and group to work with at least twice a month, a Special Education PD monthly and a Department team  meeting once a month. The Department teams will focus on coordinating their instruction across other grades to  scaffold the skills and content students need to learn and master at each grade.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          25           Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  All our teachers are currently HQT and we had 96% retention from last year. When/if we have a position, we have a  hiring team composed of teachers from the relevant subject as well as other departments and administration We will  use the DOE supports and New Visions supports to assist us in finding appropriate candidates for any open positions.  We also may reach out to past student-teachers who we were unable to hire at the time but that proved themselves  as strong new teachers and were very interested in working at our school.       Our first priority to to ensure the candidate has the appropriate license for the position and teaching schedule.  Teacher candidates are expected to do a demo lesson and both the hiring committee and students assess the  teacher’s demo lesson and then meet with the teacher to hear their reflection on the lesson and answer the  candidates questions about our school and the position and expectations.       We will ensure that there is target professional development for our new teachers as well as mentors in the licensed  area on our staff to support the teachers as they are beginning at our school. Throughout the year administration will  continue to meet with new teachers to ensure that all areas of our school expectations and requirements are fully  explained and the new staff are supported in addressing these needs.       We have a Professional Development team composed of a teacher from 5 departments, the principal and an assistant  principal. The teachers have chosen topics to focus on in Professional Learning Groups (PLG) by semester based  around the school needs identified in our school data and this CEP, as well as the transition to common core and their  departmental needs.         2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      Our PD committee meets to review school and teacher needs by department and determines a format to allow for an  in-depth study of the topics/skills each PLG will work on in the semester. Administration and teachers will identify and  attend relevant and pertinent PD outside of our school too and turn key the learnings with their colleagues.       As per teacher request, a schedule of Wednesday PD will be created that allows for:     4-6 whole department PD sessions    Our own teachers and staff to share best practices that teachers can try out in their own classes or adapt as   needed     Time for whole school topics that may be mandated (Child Abuse and Suicide Detection and Prevention to   Special Ed services) or desired (Writing Revolution Strategies).     Teacher determined teams to address topics and strategies they are specifically interested in such as   Integrating Technology into the classroom, Formative Assessment and how it can be implemented and used  to adjust instruction and impact student outcomes, Transition to new Math standards...   At times, specific staff or departments may be required to do certain PD as determined by administration due to  school, student or staff needs. One example is coaching that will take place with our special education department to  work on using testing data to determine interventions and strategies to use with students with IEP's.       During the observation process teachers will also receive specific recommendations around PD based on the  classroom observation and student data. Teachers are frequently told to visit specific teachers or subjects to observe  strategies that they can adapt or implement in their own classrooms. Additionally this year, teachers will continue to  intervisit within the school and outside the school through the Showcase School Program of the DOE.       Three teachers, one Assistant Principal and the Principal are also in the Learning Partners program as the Host school.  These teachers are working on assessment in the classroom to strengthen types of formative and summative  assessments they can implement and mentor their Urban Teacher Residents in as they work with them throughout  the school year.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44      participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Marble Hill School School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A  of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      Marble Hill School for International Studies will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:      ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

Newcomers, the "D" strand, at our school, are among those that are often most at risk for  being held back.  This past year 82% of our newcomer  10th graders have not been successful on  at least one of the required Regents for this grade (Geometry, Living Environment and Global  History) and will be attending summer school.    They struggle to make sense of some of the  dense texts found on some of these exams.    At Marble Hill our philosophy is to give ESL students the same educational opportunities as  their native English speaking counterparts. Our ELLs cover the same academic content, do the  same projects and work to the same standards as our mainstream students. To attain this  goal, ELLs need additional support outside of the classroom. To this end we are providing After  School Enrichment and Saturday Academy programs. These programs will allow our students to  expand on what they learn in the classroom and apply the concepts and skills in varied ways.  They will deepen their understanding of class projects as well as supplemental work in areas in  which the students may be struggling. Teachers will use a variety of methods to deliver  instruction: QTEL methods (several general ed teachers have been trained in QTEL),  Wrtiting Revolution, ESL through the content area approach, second language acquisition  strategies and test sophistication for Regents success. All instruction will be in English with  supports such as bilingual dictionaries and glossaries.    Subgroups and grade levels of students to be served:  The funds for Title III will focus on  students in the 9th and 10th grades.  The majority of these students will be from our D strand  with additional ELLs who struggle with literacy and/or are ELLs with disabilities.  The majority  of the students in the D strand (in 9th and 10th grades)  are entering and emerging with thirteen  transitional students.    Schedule and Duration:   Funds for direct direct instruction will be used for after-school  enrichment and our Saturday Academy. Saturday Academy will run from mid October through  the end of the school year.  The hours of operation for the Saturday program will be from 9:00 to  12:00.  After school programs will occur one day per week for one hour from 3:20 to 4:20.  The  program will occur on Thursdays as this is the day that students do not participate in Physical  Education.  This program will be supplemented by other funding sources.  During this time students will engage in enrichment activities to further their language and  content skills.  There will be an emphasis on games and communicative activities.  Additionally,  they will read engaging texts and respond to them.  Texts will be chosen for their level of interest  as well as how well they support the content of the classroom.  Students will be grouped by  grade as to better support the content of the grade.    In addition to enrichment activities, students will have an opportunity to work on projects to  increase their content knowledge. Projects will have a heavy writing focus.  Records will be kept by the teacher and attendance will be submitted to the Assistant  Principal.  Notifications will be sent to parents with translations in Spanish, Bangla, and  Arabic.  We have staff in-house that can translate.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   Language of Instruction:  Because of the diversity of our ELL population, all instruction will be  given in English.  Number and Types of Certified Teachers  Enrichment programs will be staffed by highly qualified faculty including five ESL certified  teachers, two math teachers, and one science teacher. In addition, the two administrators that will  be overseeing these programs are also ESL certified and will be working alongside the content  teachers..  These administrators will rotate duties on Saturdays.

Because of this we take professional development for this population very seriously. Many of  our staff have attended trainings to learn about effective strategies for our population. However,  everyone needs to brush up their skills in this area.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         Part C: Professional Development   Teachers to receive training:  All staff members will receive the mandated training required by  Part 154; however, there will be additional training for teachers working most closely with the  SIFE and new comer populations in the Saturday Academy and After School Programs.    Schedule and Duration: We have professional development built into our weekly program each  Wednesday from 2:10 to 3:40.  Because weekly professional development is already built into  our program, in house PD will come at no cost to Title III.   Professional Development for Title  III teachers will be more focused in the first semester to allow teachers to fully incorporate  strategies and methodologies earlier in the year.  The Principal, Kirsten Larson and the Assistant  Principal, Wanda Dingman as well as ciertified ENL teachers (Pat Bernal, Karen McMurdo,  Mary Hughes, , Melida Maldonado and Jenna Goman) will provide PD.  Sessions will be  monthly for one hour.  Agendas and attendance will be recorded and available on the Google  Drive along with materials provided to the teachers.  In addition, New Visions, the UFT and the Office of English Language Learners offer numerous  professional development session throughout the year for both content specific  and ESL teachers.  Many of our teachers take advantage of these opportunities.  We would like  to send teachers to similar trainings and use some funding to pay for per diem substitute  teachers.   We are working to make sure that all of our content and ESL teachers are trained in the Writing  Revolution, Hochman method. Most of our teachers are trained, but the remaining (and new)  teachers will be trained early in the 2018-2019 school year.  This allows all ELLs to have a  consistent writing curriculum.    Topics to be covered:   Our PD calendar is divided up into whole group sessions, department  sessions and student inquiry.   This year we will focus heavily on incorporating the Writing  Revolution strategies into the classroom.  This will cover sentence development, note taking and  outlining.  The second area of focus will be vocabulary development of tier 2 words.    Name of Provider:  Professional Development will be presented by  our Assistant Principal and  other members of our ESL department.  These staff members are all licensed in ESL.    The Writing Revolution workshops are provided by the Writing Revolution and are paid for by  an outside funder.       Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact  higher achievement for ELLs.  NOTE: These are in addition to mandated activities, such as  parent orientation during ELL identification process.     rationale       schedule and duration      name of provider    how parents will be notified of these activities   topics to be covered   Begin description here:              Rationale: At the high school level parent involvement drops off considerably. It is important  that each time we get the parents into the building, we make sure that what we offer them  is  valuable to both them and their children. It is especially important that parents of ELLs feel  comfortable at their child's school.  They are often uninformed about the school system and the  process of getting their children into college.  To this end it is crucial to provide  oppportunities for the parents to engage in school activities.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55         Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    Schedule and Duration:  Parent workshops will occur three times throughout the year.  Each of  these sessions will be approximately one and a half hours.  Topics to be covered. The parent coordinator, PTA president and ESL coordinator will create an  agenda for a series of workshops for parents of ELLs. There will be a strong focus on the  necessity of a college degree and what it takes to attend college.  Possible workshops  include:  high school graduation requirements, an overview to the College Application  Process,  and the Financial Aid Process.  Other topics to be addressed are Bullying and  Cyberbullying, citizenship/immigration issues, and the US education system including  standardized testing.   Parent sessions will be provided by Marble Hill teachers and the college  office.  Partner organizations (College Board Initiative and iMentor) will also help to facilitate  the sessions. To better engage the parents we have had success in using personal translation  devices.   We have the capacity to translate in two languages for up to sixteen parents.  We have  speakers of Spanish, Bengali and French to translate for these meetings.  If the need arises we  can purchase additional headsets.   Additionally, this year we would like to have one event in which we invite members of  community groups that support parents to come and present their work to parents.  This will be  done in a "college fair" format and allow parents to get information about a variety of supports  and opportunities.    Agendas and attendance will be recorded and files will be kept with the parent coordinator.      How parents will be notified of these activities:  • Direct calls from the parent coordinator, administration and teachers.  We utilize resources at  the school as well as DOE translation services  • a bi-monthly newsletter  • emails from our online grading system-pupilpath  • phone messenger with translations in Spanish  • materials sent home with the student or mailed       Part E: Budget   FOR SCHOOLS NOT CONCEPTUALLY CONSOLIDATED ONLY.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Currently we use Edperformance-Scantron to evaluate the reading levels of our students.  The most important information we  get from this tool is the lexile levels of our students.  We can determine to what degree our ELLs are performing in relation to  the lexile levels identified for each grade by the Common Core Standards.  This assessment also breaks down individual  skills.  For example, we can see to what grade level a student can predict a probable outcome in a passage, define vocabulary  in context, etc...    The use of edPerformance data has been critical in our drive to create a reading culture at our schools.  The first step is to  create an awareness in students of their own lexile level.  Our ELL classroom libraries are color coded with stickers indicating  lexile level ranges.  Students choose books within the appropriate levels to accelerate reading growth.  Additionally, teachers  use data to group students and determine which texts to use when texts are differentiated.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      Additionally, we use teacher created tests and assessments to determine each student's language acquisition progress as well  as their progress toward mastery of content.      One of the foundations of our school is project based learning.  In each class students complete two projects during the  semester.  English Language Learners produce the same projects as their peers; however, the projects are scaffolded to  promote success for our ELLs.  Rubrics are created to identify elements of the projects to be assessed and trends are evaluated  at both the individual student and class level.    Additionally, at the end of each semester, students present one project from each class to a teacher in a one to one portfolio  presentation.  This practice has been instituted to give our students, particularly ELLs, the opportunity to show what they  know in an oral manner.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   During freshmen orientation all students are assessed on their reading using Ed-perfomance.  Additionally, all ELLs are given  the assessment at the beginning of the year in their ENL class.  Lexile levels are distributed to teachers in order to make  appropriate material selection.    All portfolio project descriptions and clarifying questions are provided to each teacher on the school-wide drive.  This allows all  teachers, regardless of their content area, an opportunity to understand the projects and content of each class.  Answers to all  questions are also provided to the teachers facilitating the student presentation.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  As mentioned earlier, we use Ed-performance assessments at the beginning of the year.  Additionally, we assess the students  throughout the year to measure reading progress.        At the end of each term every student has a portfolio presentation with a pedagogue to present a project from each of his/her  classes. In addition to the presentation of the projects, this one hour interview includes a number of questions about the  content of each course.    This assessment allows us to identify language acquisition needs as well as content knowledge.      Our school also has a policy of final examinations in each class.  Most class examinations have a writing component and are  modeled after the Regents examinations if appropriate.  In addition, mock regents examinations are given throughout the year  to monitor progress.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    We employ several intervention if students are not meeting the standards and benchmarks set forth for them.  Our first step is  to meet individually with the student to determine if there is any issue that we need to be aware of that is impeding  progress.  Additionally, we hold a conference with  the parent/guardian so that they can be informed of any situation.  These  meetings are generally held with the guidance counselor, assistant principal, principal and/or classroom teachers.  Translation  services are used when necessary.    Classroom interventions include additional help from paraprofessionals or co-teachers, appropriate groupings with other  classmates, materials that are differentiated and scaffolded to meet the students' needs, leveled libraries, structured writing  methods and graphic organizers.  Most of our teachers have been trained in the Hochman Writing Method.  This allows  students to see the same writing strategies over multiple classes.    Students may also participate in our outside of class interventions including Saturday Academy, after school tutoring, peer  tutoring on Wednesday or Phonetic Awareness class.    We are also fortunate to have a school-based health clinic sponsored by New York Presbyterian Hospital.  There are two school  psychologists who work with students who are going through traumatic experience.  We have found that this is often the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         cause of low motivation and progress of some of our ELLs and this service has become very important in the success of our  immigrant population.       5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   We use the NYSESLAT, all Regents examinations and PSAT/SAT results to evaluate and inform our ELL programs.  As we are a  college prep school and we would like our English Language Learners to have the same opportunities as their English proficient  peers, we take all standardized tests into consideration when making programming decisions at the school.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   At the beginning of the year we have a session with the entire staff for an overview of all data points of the previous school  year.  Additionally, all information is shared on the school drive.  Teachers have access to individual student data on both the  drive and on Skedula.  Aggregated data can also be found on the shared school drive.      Data is also reviewed with various school teams.  The cabinet reviews data to determine if additional programs are needed to  meet the needs of the students.  Department teams review assessment data to choose materials and amend curricula.  The  programming team reviews data to determine course offerings and individual student schedules.           Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.     To address the needs of all ELLs, Marble Hill has developed a Freestanding ENL program that is comprehensive and  rigorous. This Language Allocation Policy for a comprehensive ENL program addresses the development of basic  literacy skills through second language learning.  English Language learners are assigned to one of two strands according to levels of English proficiency: entering to  transitional and expanding to commanding. This design allows students to receive the New York State-mandated  ENL/ELA allotted instruction time based on their proficiency levels.    Fifty percent of the incoming freshmen at Marble Hill are ELLs.  Each grade is divided into four groups (strands).  Two  of the four groups are comprised of ELLs.  Although the two ELL groups are divided between the most proficient and  least proficient students, the strands tend to be heterogeneous.  In the 9th and 10th grades the students travel with  their strands four days a week.  On Wednesdays groups are mixed for advisory and art/music classes.    In the ninth and tenth grades they are given the following courses:  •  An ENL through the content area approach in the Global History  classes. This class meets for 6 one hour blocks  during the week.  The dually licensed ENL/Social Studies teacher uses language acquisition strategies to provide  instruction in Global History  using a balanced literacy approach. Again, ENL strategies are infused into instruction so   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61         that content is amplified.  These teachers have also been trained in the Hochman writing method and have adapted  that for use with ELLs.  .A self-contained ENL class for the support of ELA content and language acquisition in the beginning and intermediate  levels, and for the development of the four language skills, is used as a functional approach to language learning. In  these classes, students develop the necessary skills for writing, reading, and word work. At the advanced levels, a  literature class is taught as part of the ELA class requirement;and a stand alone ENL class is taught by a  licensed ENL  teacher to provide simultaneous cognitive and second language acquisition.  • An ENL/ELA course.  This course focuses on the major literary components based on the CCSS.      In the 11th and 12th grades students’ schedules are individualized based on the needs of the student.  Students are  with their strands for ENL class, but all strands are mixed for most content classes. We work on a block schedule and  classes range from one to two hours.  •  An ENL through the content area approach in the Economics/Government classes. In these classes, the dually  licensed ENL/Social Studies teacher uses language acquisition strategies to increase English proficiency while  preparing students for college level work in a rigorous social studies class.  Many of our commanding students are  programmed for these classes.  •  A self-contained ENL class for the support of ELA content and language acquisition is given to all ELLs in the  eleventh and twelfth grade.  These classes are taught by ESL certified teachers.  • We also offer an ENL/ELA class taught by a dually licensed ESL/ELA teacher.  •  ENL certified teachers also push in to various math and science courses in the upper grades.      Fifty percent of the incoming freshmen at Marble Hill are ELLs.  Each grade is divided into four groups (strands).  Two  of the four groups are comprised of ELLs.  Although the two ELL groups are divided between the most proficient and  least proficient students, the strands tend to be heterogeneous.  In the 9th and 10th grades the students travel with  their strands four days a week.  On Wednesdays groups are mixed for advisory and art/music classes.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   At the beginning of each semester the ENL coordinator determines the needs of the students based on their NYSESLAT  scores.  Students in the ninth and tenth grades are then put into strands based on their needs.  Ninth and tenth graders must  take one or two additional courses in ELA/ English as a New Language aside from the ENL through the content areas  classes.  Schedules for each individual student in the eleventh and twelfth grades are analyzed by the school counselor and ESL  Coordinator to ensure compliance.  The Assistant Principal also analyzes the data reports given monthly by the superintendent  to identify students who may have been improperly programmed and changes are made to ensure compliance.    Because of the diversity of our population, we do not have HLA.  However, Spanish speaking students do have the opportunity  to take AP Spanish Language or Literature.       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   We have a variety of teachers providing services to our ELLs.  All instruction at Marble Hill is given in English.  We have  judiciously programmed teachers so that they may best support our students.  Our dually licensed teachers in ESL/Social  Studies work in double blocks with our ninth and tenth graders to scaffold material for success in this demanding, heavy text   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62      course.  We also use one of these teachers to give instruction in Economics and Government.  These social studies classes use  methodologies such as QTEL and the Hochman writing method to support language development.  We are working to align all  projects to the CCLS.  In these classes there is a heavy emphasis on textual analysis and argumentation.    In the eleventh and  twelfth grades ELLs take US Literature and Composition. These courses are aligned to the CCLS. The courses focus on the  development of the listening, speaking, reading and writing skills in English language while addressing literature and literacy.  The service providers are qualified ENL teachers.          We also employ ENL licensed teachers to co-teach in upper level math and science classes as needed and available.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   As mentioned earlier, students at Marble Hill come from a variety of language backgrounds.  When possible, we determine the  initial literacy level in languages such as Spanish, French, Japanese, Chinese and Bangla with an in house assessment. For many  of our lower incidence languages we have very little ability to assess as there are very few resources for assessment.   We have  many students from Africa who speak languages that are newly written and our students are not literate in them. Spanish  speaking students are given the Spanish LAB.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a. SIFE.  In order to address the specific needs of Students with Interrupted Formal Education and long-term ELLs, the school has a  variety of programs. As part of the school’s extended day program, after-school ENL and ELA tutoring is mandated in order to  further develop speaking, listening, reading and writing for students at the beginning levels of English proficiency. Additional  tutoring, which focuses on improving reading and writing skills, is available for intermediate and advanced level students. The  school’s Saturday Academy offers classes with similar foci. Writing skills are specifically addressed in professional  development, networking conferences, and in collaborative planning sessions between teachers. SIFE monies are used for  developing our SIFE library, Explorers Club and several book groups.  b. Newcomers  Because almost 80% of our students have been in the US for fewer than three years, we have worked very hard to create an  instructional plan for newcomers.  In 9th and 10th grades students have an extended block in Global History.  This allows  students more time to absorb the content and focus on reading and writing in the non-fiction genre.  9th grade students must  take the Common Core Algebra Regents at the end of their first year.  An after-school tutoring program has been put in place  for ELLs.  Classroom instruction at every level now includes test sophistication so that newcomers know the expectations of  the exams and gain confidence. Our newcomers are our most active members of our Saturday Academy.  We will continue to  push this for our newcomers.     c. Describe your plan for ELLs receiving service 4 to 6 years.  Approximately 50% of our ELLs receiving services from 4 to 6 years are also SIFE.  The instructional plan for these two groups is  similar, with extended day programs and Saturday Academy.  Many of these students are stuck in the intermediate stage and  this year we will focus on curriculum maps that will move students more quickly from intermediate to advanced proficiency  levels.  d. Describe your plan for Long-Term ELLs (completed 6 years).  We have a very small number of students who are long term ELLs (4).  Generally these are students who have difficulties with  literacy.   Collaborative learning and scaffolded activities help to promote literacy skills in Long-Term ELLs while allowing them  to use their stronger modalities to help them access rigorous content material.  Long Term ELLs attend after school and  Saturday programs.   e. Describe your plan for Ells identified as former ELLs.  The first thing we do when the NYSESLAT results come out and a student tests out of ESL, we evaluate to see the extent to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63      which the student should continue receiving ENL services.  If the student continues to struggle in the language, we continue  with a full ENL course .  If the student is successful they are given an  additional course taught  by our dually  certified ENL/Social Studies teacher. .  This course may be a social studies or English class.  Furthermore, we continue to allow  students accommodations on standardized assessments such as the Regents examination. All students are evaluated at the  end of each semester to determine the best program for him/her.       6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Most students with disabilities who are ELLs at our school are in ICT classes.  One of the responsibilities of the special  education teacher is to find resources appropriate for the ELLs with disabilities.  Some resources that are currently used  include graphic novel versions texts read in literature classes.  Additionally, adapted texts in science and social studies are  used. In mathematics we are using IXL which is an online program that is computer adapted.  Students can work at their own  pace on material appropriate to him/her.    Also, teacher made PowerPoints allow students to access content with many visuals.  Teachers have been experimenting with  technology.  One technique we will be exploring in the next two years is flip learning.  This will allow students to view lectures  and/or videos at home and discuss the material and do hands on activities in the class.  This will allow students to view at their  own pace and review material that they do not initially understanding.  This technique has a lot of potential for SWDs.         7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?   At the 9th and 10th grade level we have an ICT class in every major subject area.   In the 11th and 12th grade we have ICT  classes in math and English for both grades and US History for 11th grade and a mixed grade science course.  This allows all ICT  students to meet the needs of their IEPs.  For the following year we are appealing to get funding for an additional special  education teacher.  Our special education population is growing and the majority of that population is also ELLs.  We schedule  special education teachers so that they work primarily with one grade.  This allows them to really get to know the students  socially and academically.  Also, because they are in all of the academic classes, they are able to make interdisciplinary  connections and incorporate them when co-planning with the content teachers.  Additionally we have a Resource Room for  students who need it.  Sometimes we will give this in addition to the ICT classes.   We also employ six paraprofessionals that  work with ELL-SWDs.  They speak both Bangla and Spanish.   Students are released early on Wednesdays.  We have used this  time for SWDs to work with their paraprofessionals and/or student mentors on content and skills that they are having difficulty  with.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  As mentioned earlier, all instruction at Marble Hill is conducted in English; however, we do have bilingual paraprofessionals  that help in the classroom (Spanish and Bangla).  For the lowest level 9th grade class we also have a bilingual certified  teacher  that co-teaches the Environmental Science class.  In math we use programs such as IXL to meet the students at their level.  In  Social Studies we have two dually certified teachers who use ENL methodologies in the classroom.  Our science teachers for  ninth and 10th grade are QTEL trained and use scaffolding to facilitate content knowledge and language acquisition.  Additionally, 12 of our teachers have been trained in the Hochman writing method and eight more teachers will be trained in  the upcoming year.  Two of the administrators hold ESL licenses.  They observe all teachers of ELLs and work with them to  incorporate strategies for improved language acquisition.     Students also have the opportunity for extra help in content classes through after-school tutoring and Saturday Academy.          9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64      We will continue with the programs that we are currently conducting.     Improvements for the next year include training more  content teachers in the Hochman method.  Most English, ENL and Social Studies teachers are using the method and we would  like to expand the writing program to more content classrooms.      Next year we would like to strengthen our teacher teams.  We have modified our SBO so that twice a week teachers will work  on teams on an identified academic focus.  For the first term teachers will work to revise and create projects.  We will focus on  more student engagement and rubrics that are student friendly.  Additionally, we would like to improve the reflective  component of the projects.  The second semester will focus on literacy development in our lowest third.  The majority of these  students in the lowest third are ELLs.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Marble Hill’s program allows ELLs equal access to the same curriculum as English-proficient students. Content teachers work  together on lessons, projects and assessments to ensure that ELLs are receiving the same materials and information as their  native English speaking peers.  This equality has been achieved largely because of emphasis on teacher collaboration, which is  a consistent and high-quality feature of this program. Moreover, many of the Marble Hill School faculty members hold an ENL  license,.  Other faculty members have taken course work in TESOL, QTEL professional development seminars, and have  completed private ENL certificate programs.    Through our Title III grant we have an extensive after school and Saturday academy.  Both of these are well attended  by ELLs. ELLs are also very active in many of the clubs and sports at the school. Many of our clubs have actually been started  by ELLs.    We have many ELLs who are involved in the campus library and are peer educators with our school-based clinic.    Through our Title III grant we have an extensive after school and Saturday academy.  Both of these are well attended  by ELLs. ELLs are also very active in many of the clubs and sports at the school. Many of our clubs have actually been started  by ELLs     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Materials used in the classroom include:  •  Laptop carts for individual projects, class work, periodic assessments, or group work.  Many teachers have participated in  google docs workshops and are incorporating that into the ELL classroom.  This allows immediate feedback from teachers as  well as other students.   We have recently purchased a cart of iPads which we are equipping with apps appropriate to ELLs. This has been most useful  to our SIFE population.  •  Teacher created power points to support class discussions and group work.   •  Various levels of ENL textbooks and workbooks that focus on the teaching the four language skills through rich content.  •  Math and History books that are adapted for ENL students.  •  High interest books for Independent Reading for all lexile levels present in our school and covering all genres, especially non- fiction to support the other academic subjects.  •  Bilingual translation dictionaries in all the native languages of our students.        13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Students at Marble Hill come from a variety of language backgrounds which make it difficult to consistently instruct in the  Native Language Arts.  However, students are encouraged to use their first language in any way that will help them access the  material used in classes.  This may come in the form of language translation dictionaries or help from classmates with similar  language backgrounds. Students who speak Spanish may take AP courses in literature and language.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65      We have also hired bilingual educational paraprofessionals.  They speak Spanish,   Bangla and Urduquestion here:          14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    A great difficulty in working with high school ELLs is finding resources that are low level, but age appropriate.  We have gone to  great lengths to find materials that are readable, but do not appear to be too juvenile.  This includes both text books and  literature.    We also have a state of the art library on the campus.  The librarian is experienced working with ELLs and is  accommodating to their needs when choosing resources and delivering lessons.              15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    We are a co-located school.  As mentioned earlier, we have a school-based clinic that is a great resource for all schools.  The  clinic offers summer internships for students from all schools to train as peer educators.  At Marble Hill these students have  always been ELLs or FELLs.    The shared library offers many opportunities for our ELLs.  There are book clubs throughout the school year with a variety of  books at different interest and lexile levels.  Additionally, we have several students who volunteer with the librarian.    John F Kennedy has an extensive sports program and ELLs from all the schools are very active on many of the teams.    The Affinity group will be holding several professional development sessions for ENL teachers from the five DOE schools in the  building. This will allow teachers from all schools to work together for the betterment of all ELLs in the building. During the  spring 2017 semester administrators from four of these schools met to identify areas of interest in regards to ELLs.       16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   ELL students entering from intermediate schools attend an orientation during the spring prior to the first semester at Marble  Hill. This allows students to get a glimpse of the culture at Marble Hill.  During this orientation we invite ELLs to attend a  special four week summer bridge program.  Students who do not attend the orientation are contacted by phone, mail and/or  their middle school guidance counselor.  Every attempt is made to get as many ELLs as possible to attend the summer  program.  During the summer program students work on literacy and numeracy, as well as general preparations for high school  work.  They complete two projects (one in math and one in ELA) that are similar to what they will be expected to do when they  begin the fall semester.    Students who enroll during the school year are integrated as quickly as possible into our school.  They meet with both the  guidance counselor and the assistant principal to orient them to the US and our school.  Additionally, we pair them with a  student mentor, often from the Honor Society to help them adjust. These students are also encouraged to attend our Saturday  Academy.  At the Academy they can get extra help in any content area.  They also have an opportunity to socialize in an  environment that is safe and welcoming.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    ELLs and FELLs are given the opportunity to take classes in Italian, Japanese and Chinese.  Additionally, Spanish speaking  students can also take AP Spanish Language and Literature.        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66   N/A           Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Since ELLs make up approximately one third of the school’s population, Wednesday afternoon professional development  sessions have dealt with issues specific to this population. Topics have included: student-level data analysis, test review  strategies for ELLs, project-based assessment for ELLs, strategies for modifying whole-class assignments, introducing text book  strategies for content-area classes, and development of language skills across the disciplines through interdisciplinary projects.  In addition, the model of the school provides teachers with daily networking time, during which teachers engage in  professional development (e.g., writing strategies, the writing process, error correction, and project sharing) or work  collaboratively to plan instruction.  •  Many of our teachers are trained in QTEL  • We also have many teachers who are trained in the Hochman Method for writing.  Teachers have worked extensively on  teams to adapt the method to better serve our population.  An additional 8 teachers will be trained over the summer and fall  2017.  •  Teachers will be trained on how to create projects aligned to the Common Core State Standards.  •  Teachers will be trained on the Inquiry Team process and strategies they are using to help students learn academic  language.    •  Teachers will be trained on how to differentiate their lessons at monthly departmental and staff development meetings  (ongoing throughout year)  •  Teachers will be trained on how to use data to help identify strengths and areas in-need-of improvement in their  classrooms.        2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  For our teacher of ELLs, we provide PD in house on incorporating scaffolding within projects and class work,  QTEL  methodologies, the habits of effective readers, writing strategies and formats for various genres of writing, as well as  curriculum allignment to the Common Core Standards.  This work will be recorded through agendas and attendance of  teachers.  During PD we also have Professional Learning Communities.  Each group chooses an area that they would like to  research to further their practice.  Areas that teachers of ELLs will be focusing on are increasing independent reading for ELLs,  discussion techniques and protocols to increase student questioning.     To comply with the 15% required for all teaching staff, we will focus on strategies that can be used in the ENL classroom.  This  training will be given in house by trained ENL teachers. These session will also be recorded through agendas and  attendance.  Before our semi-annual portfolio presentations (all teachers will interview ELLs) we will give the entire staff a  session on how to elicit information from ELLs.              2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67      Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Paste response to question here:      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   To comply with the mandate that the parent of each ELL must have an individual conference at the school to discuss the  progress of the student, we sent out an invitation to meet with the ENL coordinator with the continuation of services letter  that was sent out at the beginning of the year.  As there has been little response to these letters, we will phone parents and  send out specific dates for each parent to meet with the ENL coordinator.  Additionally, as parents come into the school for  other business the ENL coordinator or the guidance counselor meets with the parents.  As with all one to one meetings at the  school, if there is a need for translation we try for an in house translator.  We find that the message is given much more  effectively if it is given by someone who understands the school.  If this is not possible, we use the translation/interpretation  service at the DOE.              Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Kirsten Larson, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Marble Hill School for Interna                                                                              School DBN: 10X477  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Our initial step is to use the parent's home language report (RAPL) to analyze the predominant language of our  parent and student body. During freshmen orientation sessions with parents, we also make sure to have our  parents provide their preferred language of communication.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community.

This  information is also relayed parent events such as the ELL Informational sessions at the beginning of the year and the  monthly PTA meetings.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       We will use information from the Learning Environment Survey to determine if parents are happy with the  communication they receive from the school. We also collect informal data at the end of each informational session  to assess how we can improve.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          75
