The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7     In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           8       NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           10      1.

PS73X , The Bronx School of Cultured Pearls is an elementary school with 694 students on register for the 2017-2018  school year. It is located in the Highbridge section of the Bronx with the neighborhood taking its name from the High  Bridge built in 1848 to carry Croton Aqueduct water across the Harlem River. PS 73X is just a few blocks away from  the new Yankee Stadium. We are located in Highbridge, a residential neighborhood geographically located in the  southwest Bronx is serviced by the 44th police precinct. For decades Highbridge has been one of the poorest  communities in America. More than half the population lives below the poverty line and receives public assistance  with 87.07 % of our students eligible for free lunch. The majority of our residents are of Puerto Rican, Dominican ,  African American and a growing number of students from the content of Africa. PS73X provides an education for  students in PreK-Grade 5. Our classes include monolingual, dual language, Special Education freestanding and  inclusion classes. Our school has departmentalization in grades 3-5. The classes have math and science with one  teacher, and literacy and social studies with another teacher. One teacher is responsible for teaching math and  science while the other teacher is responsible for teaching ELA and Social Studies.       This year we are continuing our collaboration with Ann Edwards in training teachers in the Orton Gillingham  Approach. It is a phonics based multi-sensory, structured, sequential cumulative approach to reading and writing. We  have instituted Early Literacy Reading Matters in grades K-2. This is an interactive read aloud approach that  encompasses literacy stations, an additional coach from reading matters that is provided for grades 3-4-5 focuses  Guided Literacy, Peer observations, balanced literacy conferencing and Guided Literacy inter-visitation. Our  Coach/facilitator demonstrates how to use interactive Read Aloud Strategies and Guided Literacy to help students  monitor their reading and to use context clues to determine the meaning of vocabulary words during their reading. In  Grades 3, 4-5 we have begun Teacher Rounds. Teacher Rounds creates a framework for critical colleageship. It  supports and assists all teachers to develop a shared vision of good teaching practices. The focus of this group is  student learning. We have a Teacher Development Coach who gives 1-1 coaching to 3 teachers focusing on Designing  Coherent Instruction (1E) and Engaging Students in Learning (3C). This year we have continued with our Dual  Language Consultant who works with both Dual Language and monolingual teachers. She focuses on engaging  students in learning (3C). This is a continuation of last years focus.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           11      We will continue to service our ENL            3.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  Our school secretary has worked closely with teachers to ensure that those that are not HQT meet all required   documentation and assessment deadlines. Lead teachers, mentors, and administrators are assigned to support  struggling and unqualified teachers. Informative professional development is given to retain HQT. Differentiated  professional development is given for all constituencies of our school and is open to all staff members (i.e. Special  education, English as a Second Language, CCCS, UDL, Danielson’s framework).        2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the strategies and activities for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, staff, and  paraprofessionals that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/information,  early intervention services, etc.).  At PS73 our preschool program effectively transitions children from preschool and other early childhood education  programs to kindergarten in a variety of ways. We coordinate professional development activities of preschool and  kindergarten teachers in order to align pre-kindergarten and kindergarten curricula and goals. Our PreK and  kindergarten classes are on the same floor allowing our preschoolers familiarity with the kindergarten classrooms and  teachers. The Administration encourages intervisitations across the grades so that teachers on the grades above and  below know the expectations of each grade. Sharing information about a child’s experience in preschool is particularly  important in cases where a child may need extra support in order to experience success in school. For example, for  children who are having particular difficulty with spoken language or cognitive skills upon entry to kindergarten, our  preschool teachers provide the kindergarten teacher with the child’s history, which would likely include  documentation of steps taken to help the child progress toward his or her program goals        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     The teachers at PS73 meet at least twice a week to plan for their grade. During these meetings, the assessments and  data are used to drive instruction. In addition every Monday afternoon teachers meet for professional development in  order to learn best practices of using data to drive instruction. Teachers use baseline assessments from EUREKA Math  before each Unit and then using that data plan the next unit accordingly.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           42        Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           43      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)    Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS 73 X, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.    The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.

Of those 79 students, 23% (22 students)  have been here for only one year. According to the ELL  Data Analysis Report Tool or EDAT, about 25% of our ELLs remained at the same proficiency  (31 students), 9 students regressed 1 proficiency level and 1 student regressed two proficiency  levels.  Our goal is to improve student performance  in core subject areas for ELLs and support their  language development.  In order to better support our students and ensure they progress along the  new language continuum, we will continue to departmentalize instruction  during the core  instructional day, providing them with integrated ENL support and supplement core instruction  during our ELL after-school Academyl to meet varied linguistic and academic needs of our ELL  in the school year 2018-2019. This will ensure that our ELL students are progressing on the  NYSESLAT and perform well on city and state level assessments.  Our performance data on TCRWP and the state ELA exam shows that our ELL population in  grades 2, 3 and 4 are mostly performing at Levels 1 and 2. Additionally, the NYSESLAT data  shows that our ELL population in grades 2 through 4 needs to work on speaking and writing  skills. They need to work on their critical thinking and academic language skills in both  languages, along with using a variety of literacy strategies. Therefore, teachers are focusing on  academic vocabulary development, reading comprehension strategies, discussion and writing  skills during classroom instruction. Furthermore, the Spanish LAB-R  and the data collected  using the ENIL (Evaluacion de Niveles en la Lectura), a formative assessment tool in Spanish,  provide us with valuable  data, which reveals that  many our new arrivals have literacy  deficiencies in their home language. We have entering ELLs,  who are largely early  readers.  Therefore, the school will offer an Early Literacy ELL Program, which will focus on  providing additional supports to this particular ELL subgroup to help narrow literacy  achievement gaps in Spanish to support the transfer of literacy skills to English.  Teachers will  use the ENIL Program to coach, confer and meet with targeted reading groups to provide  strategy lessons to support students' language and literacy development. The Early Literacy ELL  Program will commence  in October 2018 and go through May 2019 on Wednesdays and  Thursdays, from 2:30 to 4:00 pm, an average of 3 hours a week. There will be 36 instructional  sessions. Two certified bilingual teachers will provide instruction.  The student to teacher ration  will not exceed 15.  Additionally, PS 73X has planned a comprehensive after-school ELL Academy for language  instruction to support our ELLs' varied linguistic and academic needs. The primary goal of this  program is to amplify the literacy, mathematical, and cognitive/academic language skills of all       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           51      Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   ELLs by incorporating recognized and research-based ENL instructional strategies across core  content subject areas, so they can perform at city and state grade levels. These ENL strategies  will include, but are not limited to: scaffolding, TPR (Total Physical Response), song and chants,  graphic organizers, (i.e. tables, story maps), modeling and retelling, sequencing,  and Orton- Gillingham approach to teaching early literacy.   ELL students will also receive supplemental  instructional support through the use of I-READY and Imagine Learning, a technology program  used particularly with our newcomer (entering-emerging) ELLs.   Teachers will regularly use the data collected from these varied data sources to progress monitor  and to inform small group targeted instruction.  In addition, ELL students will work with  challenging and authentic activities in Math, Science, Social Studies, Technology, and ELA that  meet their unique learning styles and participate in special events that recognize the diversity of  their cultural backgrounds. Additionally, home language instruction will be used an entry to  support learning in the new language.    The program will commence October 2018 and go through May 2019. 106 students are eligible  to participate in the after school program. The language proficiency levels are as follows:   2nd  grade (29) ELLs total): 4 entering, 7 emerging, 12 transitioning, 2 expanding  3rd grade (37) ELLs total): 7 entering, 5 emerging, 7 transitioning, 17 expanding  4th grade (20) ELLs total): 10 entering, 3 emerging, 4 transitioning, 3 expanding  5th grade (20 ELLs total)  9 entering, 4 emerging, 4 transitioning, 3 expanding  The ELL Academy will be Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:30 to 4:00 pm, an average of 3  hours a week. There will be 36 instructional sessions. Two certified bilingual and one ENL/CB  (Dually certified) teachers will conduct the classes from 2:30 to 4:00 pm. There will be two  teachers assigned to three groups of students. Each teacher will be responsible for designing  lessons that integrate Science and/or Math or ELA and/or Social Studies. In addition, there will  be one technology teacher assigned to design technology activities that support all grades in the  lessons taught in these content areas. Each grade will be subdivided into two groups based on  proficiency levels as determined by the NYSESLAT or NYSITELL.   Entering and emerging students will receive more intense, skill-driven activities  in the home  language, whereas the transitioning  and expanding students will receive more academic  language enrichment. Content will be departmentalized by subject area  (Reading/Science,  math).  After 45 minutes of instruction, students will switch. The extra 45 minutes will be  dedicated to supplemental technology instruction using Imagine Learning and I-READY. There  will be one technology teacher serving all three grades. This teacher will work with the other  instructors to align what students are doing in the content areas with what they are doing in  technology. One supervisor will be assigned to monitor teachers' instruction and support teacher  development and help with providing instructional resources to enhance learning. The supervisor  has extensive training in state mandates for ELLs and has been exposed to the curriculum and  regulations pertaining to ELLs.  This knowledge will be freely shared with the teachers  in order  to move the students academically. In addition, there will be a rotating schedule and every third  Thursday, parents will be invited to work with their child during the technology piece.  The teachers assigned to be instructors in the ELL Academy possess a Bilingual or ENL  certification , as well as many years of experience working with ELLs. Teachers will  differentiate instruction to meet the needs of ELLs using various resources including Imagine  Learning, I-Ready, Genius Plaza, NYSESLAT preparation resources designed by NYC RBE- RN, and a variety of traditional and contemporary literature from Ready Gen, Scholastic, book  bins, and leveled books for classrooms both in English and Spanish. They will track student  progress with the TCRWP (administered 4 times throughout the school year), teacher generated  assessments, teacher conference notes, and progress monitoring  data from I-READY.

There will be ongoing articulation between classroom  and Academy teachers to provide continuous support to ELL students in achieving English  language proficiency so they can meet the same standards established for all students across the  grades. This communication plan helps to inform Academy instruction for each grade level  aligned with the core curriculum.   In order to improve teaching and learning in the core subject areas for ELLs, at the beginning of  the academic year, a needs assessment survey was given to all staff.  Based on the results, a  series of monthly workshops will be designed to address teachers' desires and needs for  professional development.   Teachers will receive ongoing training and support from the  Assistant Principal, Luis Quan, who is an ELL expert in addition to regular cycles of external  instructional support provided by the NYC RBE-RN at Fordham University.  . Workshops will also be led by  in-house staff members who also have years of experience,  successfully teaching ENL, bilingual, and literacy. In addition, the Bronx FSC and other outside  professional learning opportunities will provide workshops and individual assistance to all the  staff working with ELLs on the methodology and strategies of teaching ENL.    Ms. Rasuk, our ENL coordinator,  will maintain accurate student records by creating  spreadsheets that track students attendance, agendas for PD's, Parent workshops and  attendance in a binder that will be located in Mr. Quan, AP's office in Rm 306.

We will conduct the formal/  informal interviews during the following times: *On Tuesdays between 2:20-3:00 p.m., parent  teacher conferences, workshops, school events, and PTA meetings. Staff members and the  administration will  make every effort possible to answer any questions and concerns that parents  may have. Parents provide valuable information about their children, their background, strengths  and weaknesses, behavior and academic work, as well as their socio-economic situation. We will  work closely with them, for instance, when we have to make referrals for different services based  on the students’ needs. Based on that information, PS 73X has a parent program in place for the  academic school year 2018– 2019. One of the goals is to assist parents of ELLS  by offering  comprehensive community services that address their immediate needs. We have a partnership  with different community organizations such as SCAN and The Bronx Museum of Arts. They  provide academic services as well as services in legal, housing, child abuse, domestic violence,  and other social areas. They also provide information on how to use the available resources in  the community. These services are at no cost to the school.     We have been fortunate to partner with a web-based program,known as Genius Family Plaza,  since the summer of 2014 that has been able to provide targeted instruction to ELLs in math and  literacy and support their cognitive skills development.  The technology teacher assigned to  the  program will continue using Family Plaza, the parent engagement component of the website will  also be fully utilized. Parents will receive training facilitated by school-based staff and Family  Plaza consultants on how to use the program to help their children improve their reading and  how to communicate with teachers through SMS, email, notes, and phone calls. Family Plaza  helps parents with capacity building opportunities, communication tools, evaluation tools, family  literacy, academic support, and GED, ENL & computer skills.

On Thursday, parents will have  access to the computer lab, on a rotating schedule during the technology block. Based on  previous parental surveys and informal interviews with our parents, we have found that it is  important for us to provide  translated materials, information and conversations in their  native  language. Parents will also be able to receive SMS texts on their phone about their child's  progress through the site in their preferred language in addition to Class Dojo and Remind. There  are also thousands of instructional  videos on the website in a variety of languages that parents  can access to learn how to better help their children master difficult academic content at home.  Also, there will be an open invitation for parents to come and work with their child every three  weeks to enable both students and parents to use the program to its full potential and increase  students' academic skills.  In addition, PS 73X provides other parent workshops that are designed to inform parents about  their children's academic and social growth.  These workshops inform them on their rights as  parents as well as, to enable them to assist their children in their academic and social growth.  The PS 73 administrators, teachers, and social workers, invite guest speakers  to  provide  meaningful presentations. The workshops are conducted in English and Spanish  to  meet the need our community. The presentations include  themes like “The Parent Connection:  Available Programs for our English Language Learners”,  "An Overview of the Dual Language  Program,  "How to support ELL students with literacy at home using the ENIL resources",  an  ENL language Series for Parents, and “Helping your child develop critical thinking skills”.  Parents will be notified of these activities by mail, emails, fliers and parent brochures in the  parents'  language of choice as indicated on the Home Language Identification  Survey.   Attendance and agendas will be kept on file.      Part E: Budget   FOR SCHOOLS NOT CONCEPTUALLY CONSOLIDATED ONLY.  Ensure that your  Title III budget matches your Title III Plan.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  1. We use ongoing assessments and collections of student work to effectively plan for instruction and professional  development.            Formal assessment tools are used to assess early literacy skills including  the NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, TCRWP in English and  Spanish, Orton Gilliham (OG) for emerging readers, Estrellita (for Spanish reading), students’ math and writing  portfolios,  Informal assessments include conference logs, writing/math  journals, and reading and writing folders, among  others. Using the data collected from all these sources, teachers are able to create an academic profile for ELLs and analyze  their strengths and weaknesses. Our formal and informal  data  shows that our ELLs struggle with reading and writing more       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           58      than listening and speaking.     Analysis also shows that those ELLs who come with high literacy skills in their native language, they are able to achieve  the  English language much faster than those ELLs who do not have a solid literacy foundation in their native language. This  analysis allows us to  focus and scaffold  throughout the day's lessons to make language and content accessible to all ELLs,  including: native language instruction, small group instruction, explicit vocabulary instruction, graphic organizers, visual aids on  word charts and word walls.     2. What is revealed by the data patterns across proficiency levels (on the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT) and grades? Of  the  ELLs who took the (9 students) the 2016 NYSESLAT at PS 73X, 7% (16 students) scored Commanding,  9 students in  Kindergarten, 3 in first grade and 4 students in the fourth grade. We have 27% (58 students) performed at the expanding level,  more than half in the lower grades. 24% (52 students) performed at an transitional level.  26% (57 students) of ELLs increased  a proficiency level. Also noted, of the 24 ELLs who are also SWDs, 60% (15 students) increased a level. Using this data, we are  able to ascertain that more than half the students are coming in the lower grades and performing as beginners; as they move  through the school, they score intermediate, and then by the time they reach fourth and fifth grade, they score advanced. Of  the 40% (77 ELLs) who did not increase a proficiency level, 26% (20 students) were advanced ELLs in the upper grades who  remained at the advanced level due to a lack of progress in the reading and writing sections of the NYSESLAT and 38% were  newcomers who received 0 on the NYSITELL and scored Entering.         3. How does your school use information about Annual Measurable? What does the data reveal? (see SED memo and AMAO  tool) The patterns across the four modalities affect instructional decisions on an individual student basis. Teachers scaffold  lessons to address students' strengths and weaknesses as shown in class and in their NYSESLAT test scores. We use the AMAO  data to figure out ELL placement and grouping within the classrooms. Students who have not moved a level or gained 43  points, or those who have decreased a proficiency level, are looked at closely and teachers determine in which area(s) the  students need extra support. Scaffolds such as small group instruction, conferencing, explicit modeling, and vocabulary  instruction are then built into lesson plans throughout the day to address these needs. This past years, our current  Freestanding ESL students made negligible progress in the reading and writing portion of the NYSESLAT. Therefore, a certified  ESL teacher will push into the classroom during both Reading and Writing Workshop to ensure small group instruction  incorporating ESL methodology.  The school also provides a common core aligned curriculum in both ELA and Math (ReadyGen  and Go Math, respectively) that has built-in scaffold and flexible grouping, with an emphasis on vocabulary.        2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   We have 3 ENL teachers supporting two grades (one testing grade and one non testing grade) to support classroom teachers  with ESL strategies through various co-teaching models. In addition, the ENL teachers partake on those teacher teams to  further support the grade and advocate for our ELLs.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  ELL success is based on a variety of factors. We look at the NYSESLAT and the AMAOs 1, 2 and 3, which includes AYP for  ELLs.  We also look at the TCRWP and portfolios to gauge the academic success of our ELLs.  Although the majority of the ELLs  scored  a Level 1 on the 2015 ELA state exams, it was determined by ananlyzing the Scale Scores that the Level 1 were high  Level 1. Also our ELL population includes student with only 1 year or less in the school system and they are not proficient in  their Native Language as well.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Determine the specific scaffolds that target the content area demands: Recognizing the precise way in which content should  be broken down for students learning a new language or developing their home language is key for selecting scaffolds. . The  ENL team can support teachers in understanding how to create content area scaffolds such as graphic organizers, sentence  starters and rubrics that target the content area standard and match the students’ language ability in the new or home       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           59         language.   Develop specific language objectives: The linguistic demands within the Progressions will facilitate for planning for integrating  language as a teaching goal. Teachers will be able to plan for the specific language that a unit demands. For instance, knowing  the words that are necessary for introducing cause and effect (i.e. because of, due to, when) will reinforce and clarify the  content area concepts and thus help guide teachers to language development for the content.        5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]    To provide academically at-risk ELLs with scaffolded, rigorous, and culturally responsive instruction, a strong Response to  Intervention (RtI) model is in place. We have interventions in place that increase in duration and intensity over time.  All ELLs  receive strong core instruction. The rigorous standards set by the Common Core are not lowered, but rather teachers use a  variety of scaffolding techniques to make content accessible to ELLs. These techniques are based on ENL methodology and  include: accountable talk, conferencing, TPR, visual aids, songs and chants, repetition, shared reading, whole class-teacher  projects, explicit modeling, etc. Tier 2 ELLs work in small groups with their teacher to ensure that they access the material with  extra time and activities. Additionally, Tier 2 ELLs are identified by the Spanish LAB-R as underdeveloped academically in their  native language (i.e. SIFEs), so they work in small groups during Extended Day to develop native language literacy skills that  can then be transferred to developing English language proficiency.  Teachers can also partner with the family to ensure that  work continues at home so that students overcome academic difficulties. Furthermore, ReadyGen and Go Math have Tier 2  and Tier 3 interventions built into the program that teachers utilize with the students. As students improve (as measured by  reliable and valid assessments such as the English and Spanish TCRWP), the extra supports are decreased  or removed.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].      What is revealed by the data patterns across proficiency levels (on the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT) and grades? Of the  214  ELLs who took the 2016 NYSESLAT at PS 73X, 3% (7 students) scored commanding, mostly in grade 1 and grade 3. 30% (57  students) performed at the expanding level, more than half in the upper grades. 24% (52 students) performed at an  transitional level, split about evenly between the upper and lower grades. The remaining 43% (67 students) performed at the  entering/emerging  levels, over half of those in the lower grades. 44% (94 students) of ELLs increased a proficiency level. Also  noted, of the 24 ELLs who are also SWDs, 60% (15 students) increased a level. Using this data, we are able to ascertain that  more than half the students are coming in the lower grades and performing as beginners; as they move through the school,  they score intermediate, and then by the time they reach fourth and fifth grade, they score advanced. Of the 40% (77 ELLs)  who did not increase a proficiency level, 26% (20 students) were advanced ELLs in the upper grades who remained at the  advanced level due to a lack of progress in the reading and writing sections of the NYSESLAT and 38% were newcomers who  received 0 on the NYSITELL and scored Beginner. .     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   We disseminate our findings through weekly teacher team meetings and our Marvelous Monday PDs.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           60      a.  Freestanding ENL program.              Our school has 2 programs.  We have  Dual Language classrooms, and Stand Alone ENL program with a  Integrated /standalone model. All classes are grouped heterogeneously with mixed proficiency levels. The language of  instruction in the  DL classes are Spanish and English, and the Stand Alone ENL classes are English only. PS 73 is a Dual  Language school.  All DL classes (grades K--5) receive their instruction from certified bilingual teachers. The DL  program follows the 50/50 side-by-side and self contain models. The students alternate between two classrooms  every other day, with a classroom for English instruction with one teacher, and another classroom in Spanish with  Spanish instruction. All content areas are taught in both languages and lessons are continued from the previous day.  In  grades 4-5, a Self-Contained DL model is followed. The students and teacher remain in the same class and the  teacher plans for both English and Spanish lessons. Instruction is taught in English and Spanish on alternating days and  all content areas are taught in both languages. Lessons are continued from the previous day. All K-5th grade ELL  students in general education, ICT, and Special Education classes receive their instruction from a certified general  education or special education teacher, while their ENL instruction is delivered by an ENL certified teacher in a Push- in- integrated or Standalone-Pull-out model.  The LAB-R and NYSESLAT results are used to  program students and their service/ instruction. Students who are at the  entering or emerging  levels receive 360 minutes a week of ENL services. Students who are at the  transitional  or  expanding levels  receive 180 minutes a week.  The commanding students receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL  services per week as per CR Part 154-2.4[b]: The programs follow the heterogeneous model. All the aforementioned  ENL program models help ELL students to achieve English language proficiency and attain the standards established  for all students for grade promotion and graduation. In order to enrich language development, teachers have been  trained in scaffolding, differentiation, vocabulary development as part of the ToMs (Targets of Measurement), and  the newly developed Bilingual Language Progression.  Our language and instructional approaches are driven by both  authentic and standardized assessments, and student profiles. This includes explicit language and content objectives  within each lesson, the scaffolding of accountable talk, vocabulary and expressing those ideas in writing.        b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Paste response to questions here:      c.  DL program.  If applicable.       All DL classes (grades K--5) receive their instruction from certified bilingual teachers. The DL program follows the  50/50 side-by-side and self contain models. The students alternate between two classrooms every other day, with a  classroom for English instruction with one teacher, and another classroom in Spanish with Spanish instruction. All  content areas are taught in both languages and lessons are continued from the previous day. In  grades 4-5, a Self- Contained DL model is followed. The students and teacher remain in the same class and the teacher plans for both  English and Spanish lessons. Instruction is taught in English and Spanish on alternating days and all content areas are  taught in both languages. Lessons are continued from the previous day.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?                    2.     How does the organization of your staff ensure that the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according  to proficiency levels in each program model (TBE, Dual Language, ESL)? a. How are explicit ESL, ELA, and NLA instructional       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           61      minutes delivered in each program model as per CR Part 154 (see table below)? Organization of our staff ensures that the  mandated number of instructional minutes are provided according to the proficiency levels of our ELLs as assessed by the  NYSITELL or NYSESLAT.  In compliance with CR Part 154, ELL students who are at entering, emerging  levels receive 360  minutes a week of ENL services and those that are at the transiting and expanding level receive 180 minutes a week. The  program serves all students with limited English proficiency (ELL) until they achieve proficiency in the English language as  assessed by the NYSESLAT. ELL students in DL classes receive ENL services by their certified bilingual teachers during their daily  content area instruction. All ELLs in our DL classes receive NLA through the Two Way Immersion Model where there is  50%/50% instruction in English and Spanish in all content areas of the NYS core curriculum. ELL students in the stand alone ENL  program receive their services in an integrated / stand-alone  model by certified ENL teachers.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      3.    Describe how the content areas are delivered in each program model. Please specify language, and the instructional  approaches and methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of  the Common Core Learning Standards. Across all programs, scaffolding, differentiation and small group instruction are used to  meet the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards. In the DL program, all ELLs receive the same academic content as  those who are native English speakers. In the DL program in kinder-third grade, approximately 50 students are shared between  two teachers. One group receives instruction in Spanish all day, while the other in English all day. The following day, the  students switch the language of instruction (those who were with the Spanish teacher switch to the English teacher and vice  versa ) and lessons are continued from the previous day. To make sure that all content is covered, the DL teachers are given  time for weekly planning sessions in addition to the weekly grade meetings. In fourth and fifth grade, a Self-Contained model is  used and teachers and students stay in the same classroom every day. However, language alternates between Spanish and  English every other day, and lessons are continued from the previous day. To ensure students' academic progress in the stand  alone ENL program, we utilize collaborative core curriculum planning between classroom teachers, clusters and ENL support  service teachers. This means that beyond explicit ESL collaboration between classroom teachers and ESL teachers during the  integrated period, also taken into consideration are the language needs of ELLs for all content areas. For example, classroom  teachers monitor the understanding of linguistically challenging material and use a variety of phrasing and synonyms along  with visual aids to clarify meaning. During math, teachers of ELLs devote extra class time to untangling difficult word problems.  In Social Studies, teachers scaffold their instruction with visual aids such as maps, atlases and illustrations to increase  comprehension. These strategies include but are not limited to: sheltered instruction, conferencing, small group instruction,  visual aids, songs and chants, field trips, explicit modeling, TPR, illustrated word walls, technology and personalized bilingual  dictionaries. In addition, ELLs in all programs in the school work in small groups during, before, and after school that focus on  literacy and academic language. Technology is also used to promote ELL achievement and progress. Finally, in all lessons the  DL and ENL teachers include a content objective, aligned to the Common Core, and a language objective to make sure that  ELLs are meeting the demands of the CCLS and also developing their English language proficiency.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?       How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their native languages throughout the year? ELLs in the DL  program in K-2 are assessed in Spanish using Estrellita and Spanish OG.  ELLs  K-5 are assessed with the Spanish TCRWP. In  addition, all units end in a product in both Spanish and English, which is evaluated using agreed upon, research-based rubrics.  Throughout the year, ELLs in the DL classes are assessed in all subjects through these mid-unit and end of unit assessments.             5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   a.   SIFE         2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           62      b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status           6. How do you differentiate instruction for ELL subgroups? a. Describe your instructional plan for SIFE. b. Describe your plan  for ELLs who have been in US schools less than three years (newcomers).. c. Describe your plan for ELLs receiving service 4 to 6  years. d. Describe your plan for long-term ELLs (completed 6+ years). e. Describe your plan for former ELLs (in years 1 and 2  after testing proficient).   a.    The SIFE population in our school is supported with the resources as follows: -Differentiation of instruction in all areas - Tier 1, 2 and/or Tier 3 RtI as needed -Grade appropriate instructional support materials -Ongoing communication with parents  to monitor their children's progress -Small group instruction in native language whenever possible   b.     Newcomers When a new student is registered in our school, we facilitate the transition with the resources as follows: -A  "buddy system" in which we identify a similar student in his/her class who will assist during the day. -A parent interview and a  student interview -Students are encouraged to participate in after school programs -Home and school communication in the  native language -Differentiated instruction in all areas as needed -Required participation in our Extended Day program in  which they receive small group instruction -Provide students access to bilingual dictionaries and glossaries -Tier 1, 2 and/or  Tier 3 RtI as needed   c.     ELLs with 4 - 6 years service an extension of services is requested for ELL students between 4-6 years and Long-Term ELLs.  Same support structures as above are provided.   d.     Long-term ELLs An analysis on the NYSESLAT, ELA, and Math assessments suggest that their problem is in reading and  writing. Our action plan for this group involves: -Monitoring the students progress in all content areas to differentiate  instruction and accelerate their English language dvelopment and cognitive/academic skills. -Participation in the school's  literacy after-school programs -Ongoing communication with parents to monitor their children's progress -Tier 1, 2, and/or 3  RtI as needed   e.    Former ELLs -Former ELLs within 1 years of testing proficient on the NYSESLAT are placed in classes where a certified ESL  pushes in and in this way they receive the one period of service a week that they are entitled to. -Our testing coordinator  keeps track of former ELLs who have tested proficient in the last 2 years and those students receive the same testing  accommodations as ELLs.       6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?    How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable diverse ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP  goals Page 52 Courses Taught in Languages Other than English NOTE: This section refers to classes/subject areas in which the  language of instruction is English and another language which all students in the class speak.

PS 73 provides ESL  services as per CR Part 154 to its special education students. The latter are in ICT, Special Education Self-contained, and general  education classes in grades K-5 (and in TBE classes in grades 4 and 5). The school's plan for ELL-SWDs in least restrictive  environments includes all of the above mentioned instructional strategies and materials. Our plan also includes: -collaboration  between the classroom and ENL teachers and service providers -consistent scheduling of ENL teachers push-in services to  optimize planning, goal setting, and monitoring -Monitoring newcomers and/or SIFE students for possible special needs status  -Ensure that teachers of students with IEPs are familiar with the students' specific needs and that all services are provided as       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           63      per IEP mandates -Ongoing communication with parents to monitor their children's progress        7.

Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.                 9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      We participated in an intensive summer institute for dual language where teachers met with the consultant at the end of June  and beginning of July of 2015 to prepare for the new academic year. We worked on rubrics and graphic organizers in Spanish  for listening, speaking, reading and writing. We also did some curriculum planning as well for the first three units of the school  year.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We discontinued transitional bilingual in all grades due to the lack of interest based on parent selection form and other data.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  The programs are offered to all students who are classified as ELLs, we advertise, send letters home, parents apply and they  send the children to our school to receive these services.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  We use Family Plaza, Safari library (in both languages). We also use National Geographic and Reading A-Z.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           64         We have a dual language 50/50 model. In regards to ENL, we use a integrated and a stand-alone model. It depends on the  number of children who need the service. ENL is given to all students whose language is other than English on the Home  Language survey.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All the materials are age appropriate and engaging for all students to become actively engaged in all four areas  of language  acquisition: listening, speaking, reading and writing. We also foster the cultural aspect of the children's background into the  curriculum.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    We use Family Plaza, Safari library (in both languages). We also use National Geographic and reading A-Z.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   We meet with  the parents in June. During registration, we talk to the parents about different programs that we offer. The  guidance and the parent coordinator are also involved. All other activities include ells, like student counsel, graduation events,      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    We have Spanish dual language programs.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   We use a fifty /fifty side by side model in all grade levels. We also include self contained dual language  models in some classes as well. The language of instruction is divided as follows: one day content is given  completely in English and the next day, content is given completely in Spanish, we don't translate what  was taught the day before. We just continue with the flow of the lesson, we just change the language. At  times, we do simultaneous  language teaching (depending on the level of difficulty)         Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Please include all teachers of ELLs.) 2. What  professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ESL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs as they engage  in the Common Core Learning Standards? 3. What support do you provide staff to assist ELLs as they transition from  elementary to middle and/or middle to high school? 4. Describe the minimum 7.5 hours of ELL training (10 hours for special  education teachers) for all staff (including non-ELL teachers) as per Jose P. 1 and 2. The teachers' professional development  plan includes participation in professional conferences and workshops offered through the NYCDOE Office of English Language  Learners (OELL). These professional training opportunities address effective ways of stimulating literacy, math and content       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           65         area language development in the second language of both English and Spanish dominant students. As a result, English  speakers will develop English language competency in speaking, listening, reading and writing without compromising academic  performance by their involvement in a DL program. Likewise, the ELLs will develop high levels of speaking, listening, reading  and writing ability in their native language without foregoing its development as they accelerate their English language  development. 3. The parent coordinator and the bilingual guidance counselor provide all parents and students the necessary  information about middle schools' requirements and placement. These staff members help ELL students make the proper  school choice as they transition from elementary to middle school. In audition, the ELLs in 5th grade that are moving to a  middle school the following year participate in the 5th Grade Academy. Six weeks prior to graduation, classroom teachers  become content specialists and classes move from teacher to teacher throughout the day in the way they would in a middle  school. In this way, ELLs experience a new schedule in an environment in which they feel comfortable. 4. On staff development  days, the bilingual coordinator and/or ESL teacher, members of RBE-RN, and the NYCDOE OELL provide numerous ELL  workshops and over professional development. All classroom teachers receive instructional support in ESL methodology.  Attendance is taken and records are kept in the teachers' files.   Paste response to question here:        2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Paste response to question here:     Paste response to question here:          Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  2. Does the school partner with other agencies or Community Based Organizations to provide workshops or services to ELL  parents? 3. How do you evaluate the needs of the parents? 4. How do your parental involvement activities address the needs  of the parents? 1 and 2: Parent involvement in our school is a key component of our yearly planning. School orientations are  provided for parents of newly registered ELLs by the Parent and the Bilingual Coordinators to provide them with information  about the DL and ESL programs at PS 73. Parents are informed of program descriptions, instructional requirements, and school  expectations through an orientation video, parent guides and other literature in the parents' home languages. As required  under CR Part 154, parents of newly enrolled ELLs are also invited in the fall and spring semesters to Parent-Teacher  conferences to discuss student performance. Information shared with parents of ELLs includes: the Language Allocation Policy;  the NYSESLAT, ELA, Math and the Science state tests; testing exemptions, modifications and accommodations for ELLs; and the  grade promotional policy. All meetings are translated for parents in Spanish and other languages when a translator is available.  Recognizing that the parents of ELL students face their own challenges in transitioning and adapting to a new culture and  school system coupled with their own need to build confidence and capacity to support their children in school, we constantly  build on our parent involvement activities. Parents are invited to participate in monthly PTA meetings and workshops. Other  parental activities include holiday celebrations, school assemblies, and graduation ceremonies. 3. Parental needs are evaluated  through formal interviews and informal conversations during parent-teacher conferences, workshops, school events, and PTA  meetings. Staff and the administration make every effort possible to answer any questions and concerns that parents may  have. Parents provide valuable information about their children, their background, strengths and weaknesses, behavior and  academic work as well as their socio-economic situation. We work closely with them, for instance, when we have to make  referrals for different services based on the students' needs. 4. Because parents are essential members of our school  community, parental involvement activities always address their needs. We work closely with them to monitor student  academic progress and ELL students' development of English language proficiency.           2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           66            2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   We welcome parents during our terrific Tuesdays and any class field trips.   In addition, we host a series of parent workshops  on various academic and parenting  topics.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Vivian Bueno, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.            2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           68                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PS 73X                                                                              School DBN: 09X073  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      The data and methodologies we use to assess language preferences of the parent community at PS 73X is first to  administer the Home Language Identification Survey, and then to conduct a thorough parent interviews in the  parent's language of preference by a licensed pedagogue. Once the parent has filled out their language  preference/ language survey form, Student Emergency card, and language home survey, the data is entered  manually into ATS. We use the RAPL and UPPG reports in ATS to ensure that all written communication is sent  home in the parent's language of preference.

Preparation for the translation of written documents occurs two months in advance of distribution.  The documents are drafted in English and then given to an appropriate staff member or sent to the Translation  and Interpretation Unit for translation. In our school we have several staff members who serve as written  translators for most of our high incidence languages including Spanish and French. The remainder of the  translation is performed by the Translation and Interpretation Unit. When all translated versions of the  documents are received they are copied and collated into grade level classes.    Timely provision of interpretation services at group and one-on-one meetings upon request when such services  are necessary for parents to communicate with teachers, guidance counselors, school nurse and/or other school  staff regarding critical information about their child's education.
