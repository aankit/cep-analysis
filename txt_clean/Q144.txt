This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The Mission of P.S 144 is to continue our work in creating a community of learners who know it is safe to think,  create, struggle and persevere. It is out intention to have learners who learn for more than the moment. We want  students to dive deeply into conversation, reading, writing, and, math and sciences in such a way that they will know  how to work through problems- regardless of any particular test structure. The skills they carry will be born of  experiences with struggle, and creatively persevering.We want the skills to stay with them, and draw on them now,  and forever.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    At PS 144, we continue to pride ourselves on our high achievement in all areas. We continue to achieve through  continual reflection collaboratively with our community of parents, teachers and the entire staff of our “village.” Our  expectations reflect the deeply held belief that we are responsible for all areas of a student’s development- academic,  social, and emotional and that through this development our world has change agents for the better.   Additional Initiatives:   ● We continue to now have upper and lower grade teachers of science in order to provide students a hands-on  experiential approach to learning. We will be receiving STEM LABS in 2018-19 to enhance the science teaching as well  as a coding lab.   ● We are continuing to support our Math Enrichment Cluster to increase the rigor in mathematics in the 2018-19  school year.    ● All Social studies instruction has realigned to address the changes to the scope and sequence. We have adopted the  NYC Social Studies resources again for 2018-19.   ● Teaching is differentiated to challenge all students, and enrichment is provided to all students, whether high  performing, performing below standard level, English language learners, and special education students. We have a  Push-in Gifted and Talented Teacher twice a week as well as a Response to Intervention teacher to meet these special  needs as well.   Our school-wide goal of using small group instruction as a vehicle to increase reading levels will increase our capacity  to meet individual student need.   ● We use many data sources, to drive instruction that is adaptive to meet student needs.      In 2017-2018 we identified needs and goals based on the scores from the NYS Math and ELA as well as our  own sources.    In our last CEP for 2018-19 we included innovations that will continue this CEP cycle. Innovations include :       Brain Power for all grades (new to CEP). In 2018-19 we are introducing the next steps. which include student   led Brain Power in order to enhance self assessment (personally and curriculum-wise) as well as Parent  workshops to include families in the social emotional aspects of this work.     As we do in Reading and Writing, we will continue to used pre tests in Math and On Demands in Writing to   determine the lessons needed in a unit, ones to skip, who needs small group work and those who need  enrichment. We will continue this practice for 2018-2019, as well as to use protocols to determine if critical  thinking is embedded and evident in the units and student work.   THE MOST GROWTH: Our ELA performance scores went up 6% from 2017 to 2018. The school has made consistent  growth in the Framework elements of Collaborative Teachers, Strong Family-Community Ties, and Trust according to  the NYC School Survey 2018.   THE CHALLENGES: Although by the end of June 2018 81% of students were reading at or above level based on  Teachers College Running Record data, there are still a number of students who come into a grade in September  reading below grade level and do not reach grade level benchmarks by June. In order to better help students progress  through reading levels more rapidly, we have focused our school-wide goal, professional learning time, and  partnership with Teachers College Reading and Writing program coaches to build teacher capacity to lead targeted  small groups.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10            3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   To reach a variety of learners, ENL. Gifted, Special Education, we utilize multiple points of entry into each lesson  planned. Teacher pedagogy is developed and we ensure that it is differentiated to enable all students to produce  meaningful work products. In order to ensure the Common Core Learning Standards are infused throughout all  lessons, curriculum mapping and planning are done with staff developers both in and out of the building. There are  ample opportunities for the faculty to plan for higher order tasks with our Borough Math and ELA instructional teams  in addition to our Staff Developer from Teachers College. Further, we have added a Math Enrichment Teacher to  further our mathematics for all. To focus on college readiness, curricula have been aligned across grades and subject  areas through inter-visitations, professional learning, common preps per grade, and vertical planning with teacher  facilitators. Professional learning and Professional Collaboration time is used for planning and to analyze student work  to drive future instruction.     4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Our Survey Element Scores remain high. For Rigorous Instruction, we earned a score of 4.26 in 2018 (up from 4.18 in  2017). Additionally, we saw an increase on our Statewide ELA exam (6% increase, from 64% to 70%) and our Math  Statewide exam (1% increase, from 70% to 71%). For Collaborative Teachers, we earned a score of 4.53 (a slight drop  from 4.56 in 2017). For Supportive Environment, we earned a score of 4.34 (a slight drop from 4.35 in 2017). For  Effective School Leadership, we earned a score of 4.26 (up from 4.17 in 2017). For Strong Family-Community Ties, we  earned a score of 4.47 (up from 4.13 in 2017). For Trust, we earned a 4.57 (up from 4.39 in 2017).   Our most progress was in the element of Strong Family-Community Ties where we saw an increase of .34 (4.13 in  2017 to 4.47 in 2018).

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     Based on our Data across our math units of study, NYS Math Test, NYS ELA Tests and Teacher College Reading and  Writing Units of Study, we determined that our scores while high, could move even higher.   In ELA 70% of students performed at a level 3 or 4 on the 2018 ELA Statewide Exam. According to our Teachers  College Reading and Writing Running Records from June 2018, 81% of students were reading at or above grade level.  According to our Teachers College Reading and Writing Units of Study in Writing, 78% of students final published  writing piece was at a level 3 or 4 (with scaffolds).   In Mathematics 71% of students performed at a level 3 or 4 on the 2018 Mathematics Statewide Exam. According to  our GoMath Chapter Tests, 82% of students had an overall average of level 3 or 4, and 74% of students scored a level  3 or 4 on their GoMath End of Year Exam.   We determined that helping more students to become proficient readers will produce positive gains in all subject  areas. We believe building capacity through the teacher development and practice with small group work will  accelerate student progress through reading levels more rapidly. We see this as both a rigorous instruction and equity  goal. (Comparably high academic achievement and other student outcomes) As data on academic achievement and  other student outcomes are disaggregated and analyzed we will strive towards comparable performance for all  identifiable groups of learners, and achievement and performance so that gaps are virtually non-existent. We will use  both intervention and on grade level materials such as TC, Greatleaps, LLI, and Dibbles along with our structure of  targeted small group instruction.                     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13              Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

NA        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Column B   Verify with an (X)   Section Reference(s)   Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local                                                  1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school PS 144 in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Elementary  and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      PS 144 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Elementary and Secondary School Act;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.               School-Parent Compact (SPC)   [PS 144 ] , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is  implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between  the school and the families.

It is anticipated that approximately 15 eligible students will accept the invitation  into this before school program.  Our school will use the co-teaching and co-planning  model.  The language of instruction for this program will be in English.  We will be targeting  third, fourth, and fifth graders in order to provide them with additional support, in preparation for  standardized testing in Language Arts, Mathematics, and Science. As new admits are identified  needing ENL services they will be offered this program. The teachers will provide instruction to  the ELLs in the A.M. program, which will be held 2 days a week from 7:15 until 8:00 A.M and 1  day a week from 2:20 to 4:00 P.M.  This program will be taught by 2 ENL teachers (1 with Dual  Certification in Common Branches and ENL) with the support of the Technology/Common  Branch teacher.  The students duration of the program will be four months (3 times a week),  beginning in mid October and ending in January.  The ENL teachers will provide ENL services  and utilize strategies to help English Language Learners.   The supplemental program that we will be utilizing will be from Imagine Learning, a research- based, standards aligned curriculum that builds core reading and academic language skills, with  first language support.  Imagine Learning appeals to multiple learning styles, adapts instruction  with personalized learning paths, and uses benchmark assessments. Students are assigned lessons  required to fill in gaps in their overall skills. By providing continuous, auditory corrective  feedback across all learning platforms, Imagine Learning addresses several important Children  First goals and Title III guidelines. Besides working with the teachers, the students will utilize  the computers for direct instruction with the computer program Imagine Learning. Students will  automatically notice the program's visual and auditory appeal as they move through the online  individualized program.  Imagine Learning motivates students to become confident, expressive,  and fluent readers.  It maximizes students’ time on task during independent learning blocks with  standards based, data driven differentiated instruction.  It provides a multi-sensory learning  environment that scaffolds students through the five dimensions of reading toward a goal of  independent reading.  Its multi-sensory ingredient engages students, regardless of their  proficiency or learning style, by incorporating all learning modalities-auditory, visual and  tactile/kinesthetic.   Teachers will use the reporting features including continuous assessment of  accuracy, fluency, comprehension and language to monitor student progress. As students move  through the Imagine Learning online program we will run the reports to support further  instruction.  The materials are supplemental materials used only for the Title III a.m. program.  Teachers will take attendance daily and letters will be sent home to the parents inviting their  child to the program in both English and their home language.  Another component of the Title III program will be held after school 1 day a week.  Based on  assessment data, ENL and ENL/Common Branch teachers will provide hands on, interactive  ELA, Math, Art and Science activities.  These activities will be designed and planned by teachers  to allow opportunities for academic discussion between students supporting speaking, listening,  reading, and writing across the content areas.  This includes but is not limited to science  experiments, project-based learning, artistic self-expression, and problem solving  strategies.  During these activities, students will be provided with ENL strategies and scaffolds to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45            Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   ensure comprehension and participation for the different individual learning styles.  Throughout  the Title III program, teachers will continue to monitor student progress through Imagine  Learning assessments and design these activities based on demonstrated student needs.   The final component will take place on 4 Saturdays during the program from 8:30 A.M. – 12:30  P.M.  On these days, local organizations will come to our school and provide students, alongside  the ENL and ENL/Common Branch teachers, with hands on experiences and activities. Through  the local organizations students will be given content support in Language Arts, Mathematics,  Science and Social Studies.  Students will learn language structure and vocabulary in a highly  intuitive and contextual way through the trips and conversations with peers and adults in  English.  This also gives students and their families the exposure to local organizations within  their own community to continue to visit and work with outside of school.

Also, parents will be given more information about the  after school and Saturday components of the program.  Additionally, parents will be invited to  observe the morning program throughout the year to assess how their child is doing. During the  course of the school year, the teachers will continue to maintain contact with parents in their  preferred home language, giving feedback and suggestions.  All parent outreach will be  conducted in their home language using resources such as Translation & Interpretation Unit,  bilingual staff members and parent volunteers to better communicate.  The teachers will discuss  with the parents: how Imagine Learning helps their child learn English, give ideas for at home  activities that extend ENL instruction time at home, and encourage computer based instruction to  aid ELLs at home.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Our school uses the TCRWP to assess the literary skills of all our students, including our ELLs.  The students are assessed  individually throughout the school year in order to determine their instructional reading level.  During these assessments, the  lower grade students are asked to read simple books and the upper grade students are asked to read aloud a number of  different reading passages, in order to evaluate their decoding skills.  Afterwards, the students answer questions, related to  the books or passages, in order to determine their literal and inferential comprehension skills.  After the completion of this  assessment, the students are assigned a reading level, which is helpful for both them and their teachers when they select  fiction and non fiction books to read during independent reading time.  These reading levels are also used to place students in  small reading groups.  These groups are flexible and change throughout the year based on student progress.  Classroom  teachers and ENL teachers also administer the writing assessment as part of TCRWP.  These on demand writing assessments  are administered before and after completion of a writing unit to measure student growth.    Our school also uses different computer programs to help them progress in their literacy and comprehension skills.  MYON is a   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      program where teachers are able to connect to their account to choose books for them and review data to see where they are  showing growth and where they are showing struggling.  MindPlay is a literacy program that teachers are able to connect to  see student progress in phonics, reading fluency, and comprehension.    In the lower grades we also use Fundations and the upper grades, Words Their Way as supplemental literacy  components.  These programs and assessments focus on the phonics components of the language.  This is a strong foundation  for ELLs and has been proven to support the building of their language acquisition.  The ENL teachers, in addition, use their own teacher-created assessments to measure the different English language  components (reading, writing, listening, speaking.)  These assessments are given at the beginning of the school year to  supplement students' NYSESLAT/NYSITELL levels and give a more complete view of their English language abilities.          2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The TCRWP assessments are administered at minimum four times a year (September, November, March, and June) to all  students including ELLs.  This allows teachers to assess and analyze students' literacy and language acquisition compared to  grade level standards and their peers.  Teachers receive coverage for their classes in order to administer running record  assessments and give students individual attention.  Time for a pre and post writing assessment is built into all teacher unit  study schedules for all grades.  All teachers including ENL and out of classroom teachers have access to these levels anytime  through the school's Google drive website.  Teachers can use these levels when planning instruction and  differentiating.  Students can access the different computer programs to complete on going assessments both in school  (classroom, before school, computer class) and at home.  There is flexibility in teacher schedules to allow for any other  necessary assessments.         3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Our school uses Measures of Student Learning through Teachers College Reading and Writing Project (TCRWP) Running  Records as a baseline/benchmark assessment for all students, including ELLs.  The students are assessed individually twice a  year, at the beginning and end of the school year, These assessments show how a student has progressed over the year  according to their own baseline, and how they compare to grade level benchmarks.  During these assessments, the lower  grade students are asked to read simple books and the upper grade students are asked to read aloud a number of different  reading passages, in order to evaluate their decoding skills.  Afterwards, the students answer questions, related to the books  or passages, in order to determine their literal and inferential comprehension skills. The results provide insight and give an  instructional reading level.    Another summative assessment used is the NYSESLAT to measure their achievements quantitatively by examining their  scores.  Scores are examined across all four modalities including speaking, listening, reading and writing to determine a  student's strengths and area of need.  The data reveals trends across grade level, years of services, and proficiency level.        4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    After MOSL TCRWP data has been gathered these reading levels are used to identify students who may benefit from  interventions. These interventions could include flexible student groupings and differentiation of instruction.  Any student who  scores below grade level (1 or 2) is recorded on an RTI/AIS excel tracking form which all teachers have access to, including ENL  teachers and out of classroom teachers.  This tracking form includes information on which of the five reading pillars students  are struggling with.  These pillars include phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary and comprehension.  Students'  classroom teachers and ENL teachers collaborate on which strategies may help these students, and these strategies are also  recorded on the tracking form.    After NYSESLAT data has been gathered students' scores are used to identify areas of need that students may have in  common.  ENL teachers use this to help organize the grouping and scheduling of students to maximize instructional time and  focus on common needs and goals.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51         5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   At P.S. 144, we have an RTI support team and they work closely with the classroom teachers and the ENL teachers.  First, the  Home Language Identification Survey will let us know information that could influence the student's English language learning  process.  In addition, students will be assessed in their literacy skills to see if they are meeting grade level benchmarks.  If an  ELL student (excluding newcomers) is flagged at risk and there is evidence and data showing that the student needs more than  just English language interventions,  teachers will follow the RTI framework. This may include differentiated groups in the  classroom, implementation of new classroom strategies, or a push-in support.  Students will first be considered for Tier 1  where the student receives core instructional support within the classroom setting with different strategies that the teacher  may implement as well as progress monitoring.  This could then possibly move to Tier 2 where the student receives targeted  interventions where more specific support is needed to make progress.  In our school this includes small group SETSS in both  literacy and math and  a reading teacher/Certified Recovery Teacher & Reading Specialist who provides intervention services  through a Leveled Literacy Intervention.  Another intervention program targeted for reading that is used is called Great Leaps.  If Tier 1 or Tier 2 are not sufficient enough, we may move the student into Tier 3 where it is a more intensive intervention with  more individual support as well as progress monitoring.  All of these supports will be delivered in coordination with language  support serviced in ENL.  Through collaboration, any interventions or strategies will be seen in different settings throughout  the school day depending on where the student is.       6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Data from the NYSESLAT is used to measure ELLs achievements quantitatively by examining their scores.  Scores are examined  across all four modalities including speaking, listening, reading and writing to determine a student's strengths and area of  need.  The data reveals trends across grade level, years of service, and proficiency level.  If a student receives a 3 or 4 on the  ELA and scored at the expanding level on the NYSESLAT, students are considered proficient and no longer need to take the  NYSESLAT exam (but will still receive 2 more years of ENL services according to the provisions of CR-Part 154.)     In addition to revealing information about a student's language acquisition and providing a basis for differentiation in the  classroom, NYSESLAT levels also inform scheduling.  According to the mandates of CR Part-154.2, students receive different  amounts of standalone and integrated ENL minutes based on the results of the NYSESLAT outcome assessment.  Students who  score at the Entering level will receive 180 minutes of integrated and 180 minutes of stand-alone ENL. Emerging students will  receive 180 minutes of integrated, 90 minutes of stand-alone and 90 minutes of either stand-alone or integrated ENL per  week.  ELLs at the transitioning level receive 90 minutes integrated and 90 minutes of either stand-alone or integrated per  week.  Expanding ELLs receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL each week, and Commanding ELLs receive 90 minutes per week  for two years after they pass.  NYSESLAT results are viewed on ATS and used to create a program schedule at the beginning of  each school year in September.  NYSESLAT levels are also used to inform scheduling.  Students may be grouped in  heterogeneous and/or homogeneous groups based on their levels and needs, so they will have different learning experiences  and learning environments.        7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Students' NYSESLAT levels are analyzed at the beginning of each school year in order to create a program schedule.  Their raw  scores are examined in order to determine both student groupings/schedules and individual areas of need. We use ATS reports  to find student scores and then record them on a teacher-created spreadsheet which records students' levels, years of  proficiency, home language, grade, class and IEP status, and other information.  This "Master List" spreadsheet is kept up to  date so the ENL teachers can easily and quickly check for important information while scheduling and planning lessons and  units.  Administrators are also given a copy of this spreadsheet, and classroom teachers receive a copy of their ELL students'  language proficiency levels at the beginning of the year.  They also receive information (by e-mail and hard copy) about what  the different NYSESLAT levels mean in terms of student needs and programming minutes. This horizontal dissemination of  information about students' levels and needs ensures that all teachers and administrators have the information they need to  help their ELL students.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52           Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   1a.   Currently, the freestanding ENL program at PS 144 is a push-in and pull-out program consisting of small,  heterogeneous and/or homogeneous groups of students. The ENL teachers both provide stand-alone and integrated  ENL in push-in and pull-out settings.  Based on student levels they are mandated the appropriate amount of  integrated and stand alone time as per CR Part 154.2.  ELLs at the entering level receive 180 minutes stand alone and  180 minutes integrated per week.  ELLs at the emerging level receive 180 minutes integrated, 90 minutes stand alone,  and 90 minutes of either stand alone or integrated per week.  ELLs at the transitioning level receive 90 minutes  integrated, and 90 minutes either stand alone or integrated per week.  ELLs at the advanced level receive 90 minutes  of integrated per week.  ELLs at the commanding level (grades 1-5) receive 90 minutes of integrated per week. Pull- out groups are small, heterogeneous and cover no more than 2 contiguous grade levels as per CR Part 154.2  instructional mandates.       In our school, ELLs are usually divided equally among all the classes on a particular grade, rather than being  concentrated in one classroom so the classroom teacher has more of an opportunity to provide individual and small- group support and differentiate instruction for these students.  Also, we have many students who must be placed in  specific classroom settings based on IEP status or because they are in the Gifted and Talented program. Every effort is  made to place a newcomer ELL in a classroom where at least one other child speaks the same native language, and  can serve as his/her buddy and translator. All integrated ENL minutes are taught through careful  collaboration between classroom teachers and the ENL teachers.  The two teachers will work together on planning  and executing lessons using a variety of co-teaching models, according to the lesson and student needs. In addition,  ENL teachers attend grade-level professional development and planning meetings, to ensure the alignment of ENL  instruction to grade-level standards and offer ENL strategies and support to classroom teachers.      b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Currently, our ENL teachers ensure that all of our ELLs are fully served with the mandated number of minutes necessary for  each proficiency level.  Scheduling is based around each classroom schedule to make sure students are receiving services at  the appropriate time.  This means that ELLs at the entering level receive 180 minutes stand alone and 180 minutes integrated  per week.  ELLs at the emerging level receive 180 minutes integrated, 90 minutes stand alone, and 90 minutes of either stand  alone or integrated per week.  ELLs at the transitioning level receive 90 minutes integrated, and 90 minutes either stand alone  or integrated per week.  ELLs at the expanding level receive 90 minutes of integrated per week.  ELLs at the commanding level  (grades 1-5) receive 90 minutes of integrated per week. Student schedules are created by the ENL teachers to ensure they are  receiving the correct amount of ENL minutes per week. These schedules are then given to administration and classroom  teachers, and minutes and schedules are immediately entered into the STARS classroom system.  The pupil accounting  secretary consults often with the ENL teachers to make sure that all new admits are entered accurately on ATS and STARS.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53        Stand-alone and Integrated ENL minutes are both vital for students' language acquisition.  In stand-alone ENL, the emphasis is  on the acquisition of social and academic vocabulary along with explicit grammar instruction, taught through various ENL  methods and strategies including Total Physical Response, the use of visuals, differentiated activities, cooperative learning, the  Language Experience Approach, songs, scaffolding, etc.  During Integrated ENL, Sheltered Instruction is used to embed grade- level Common Core ELA instruction with ENL strategies and tools.  ENL teachers will bring in tools, materials, and strategies  into the classroom in order to help ELLs complete their assignments and truly participate, socially and academically, in their  grade level classroom.   This helps our ELLs to meet the Common Core standards, better understand what is being taught in  their classrooms, and thrive socially and academically.       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   During Integrated ENL instruction, Sheltered English is used to ensure comprehension of content area material in ELA, Math,  Social Studies and Science.  A variety of co-teaching models may be used during push-in integrated ENL to deliver  instruction.  ENL teachers and classroom teachers collaborate to plan for all learners and instruct.  An emphasis on academic  vocabulary is also used, including visuals to support vocabulary development and explicit pre-teaching and post-lesson review  and practice of vocabulary words.  In addition to lesson modifications, ENL teachers also bring in additional tools and materials  including flashcards, visual vocabulary, and translated materials to help make lessons comprehensible to ELLs.  Graphic  organizers such as K-W-L Charts, Venn Diagrams, Thinking Maps where the children have to compare and contrast and  organize information sequentially have also been helpful in facilitating language development, making the content areas more  comprehensible for ELLs, and scaffolding assignments.  Since higher literacy in the L1 promotes language acquisition in the L2,  native language support is always provided when possible.  Older ELLs who are literate in their native language are encouraged  to keep bilingual dictionaries for native language support.  In addition, all ELLs who speak who speak one of the nine translated  DOE languages are provided with bilingual glossaries in mathematics, social studies and science. Bilingual and native language  books are also available through the ENL classroom library and online on the levelled reading program Myon.  To help students  understand assignment instructions, versions with simpler language or translations are often provided by the ENL teacher and  classroom teacher. ELLs also may receive different assignments based on their language ability.     Thematic units that are pertinent to social studies and science grade level curriculums are taught as well.  The ENL teachers  have a variety of non fiction books, written on a variety of reading levels in English, which are aligned with the social studies  and science curriculum of different grades.  The different units from Teachers College give our ELLs greater exposure to non  fiction reading material.  In addition, the requirement to produce informational reports  also increases the development of  academic vocabulary.  It must be noted that the ability to comprehend non fiction reading material and to write informational  reports are included in the Common Core Standards adopted by New York State.      During Stand-alone ENL instruction, many of the same approaches and tools are used.  More explicit instruction in English  language grammar, especially for older ELLs, is also provided.  Speaking and listening skills are also taught during Stand-alone,  providing ELLs with vital opportunities to interact with each other and practice speaking to each other and their teachers in a  friendly, supportive classroom environment. To facilitate this speaking practice, visuals, sentence starters, sentence frames,  and accountable talk stems may be used.  These strategies, tools and techniques all help the ELL to meet the academic  demands of the Common Core Learning Standards in their general education and ENL classrooms.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   The school community at P.S. 144 includes students from over 50 countries, who speak more than 30  different languages at  home.  As a result of this impressive linguistic diversity, there is no one dominant first language among our ELL  students.  When necessary, bilingual staff members and parents translate and interpret for ELL students and families, and the  school makes use of DOE and outside vendor translation services to ensure students understand what is going on and feel  included.  Home language support is used in the ENL classroom through these services, Google Translate, translated materials,  and a bilingual buddy system.  Myon is an online levelled library with books available in several languages, which all students  have access to.  In addition, if students are not yet able to express themselves in English, we always encourage them to use   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      their native language to do so.  We also encourage parents to continue reading, writing and speaking their native language  with students to ensure that they continue to improve in both (or all) of their languages.        5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a. Although there are no SIFE students currently registered at PS 144, we have an instructional plan in place should any of  these students register.  First, we would place the child in an age appropriate classroom, where he/she would be paired with a  buddy who speaks his/her native language.  Second, arrangements would be made to have a parent volunteer work with the  SIFE child on an individual basis.  In addition, any SIFE would receive additional support through ENL and additional academic  intervention services, provided by a push-in certified teacher during the school day and including native language support if  possible.  Finally, the SIFE child would be eligible for the morning Title III program, a prescriptive technology program which  provides extra assistance three mornings a week.     b. Instruction for newcomers (0-3 years) can be differentiated in a variety of ways.  Classroom material can be differentiated in  terms of process, product or content, and a newcomer student (especially in the older grades) may need instruction  differentiated in all 3 ways at first.  Newcomers may need a great deal of time and exposure to English before they feel  comfortable speaking or interacting with teachers and students; so they will be taught in a warm, friendly and low-pressure  environment.  For speaking, they may need sentence starters and activities like choral reading.  They receive different  homework and assignments than their advanced ELL and monolingual peers, and take home and read books that are at their  instructional reading level (even if this is far below the grade level standard at first). Newcomer children are placed with a  classroom buddy who speaks the same language, and native language support is provided where possible by teachers and  peers.  In addition, efforts will be made to secure a Parent Buddy, so that the parents of the newcomer would be able to  familiarize themselves with the American educational system. The content that newcomers are taught may differ from their  monolingual peers, as they may need to learn the building blocks of a skill in English before they can understand grade-level  concepts and language.  Some students may need instruction in phonics, decoding and the alphabet, especially if their first  language uses a different alphabet.  During Stand-alone ENL, newcomers also receive instruction in Basic Interpersonal  Communication Skills (BICS) and English grammar in order to be able to interact comfortably with others in the school setting  and beyond. Visuals, music, videos and technology also provide multiple entry points for students new to the language and  school.  Because ELLs at our school tend to pass the NYSESLAT within 3 years of entering the school, newcomers make up the  biggest portion of our ELL student body. Despite the variety of differentiation used, even these newcomers are held to high  academic standards and can succeed academically with the right supports in place.      c. Developing ELLs (4-6 years of service) are also taught using a variety of differentiation techniques.  While students become  fluent in BICS within a year or two, it takes most language learners much longer to develop grade-level academic language, or  CALP (Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency).  Therefore much of the differentiation used for developing ELLs is focused on  academic language and skill development and Tier II and III academic vocabulary development.  Flexible, heterogeneous  groupings and graphic organizers are often used in the classroom with developing ELLs. Grouping developing and newcomer  ELLs together, and mixing proficiency levels, allows students to learn from each other and gain a feeling of expertise from  helping their newcomer peers.  Developing ELLs typically feel more comfortable speaking in the classroom environment, but  may still benefit from sentence starters and sentence or paragraph frames to help them organize their thoughts and use  appropriate academic content language when speaking or writing.  Graphic organizers are also used to scaffold the writing  process for developing ELLs, and multiple types of assessments are provided to allow students of varying language  proficiencies and learning styles to demonstrate their understanding. Because of their individual needs, developing ELLs may  also need any of the previously mentioned differentiation techniques used for newcomer students.  All teachers, both ENL and  classroom, use the knowledge they have of each student's linguistic and academic strengths and needs when determining how  to differentiate instruction.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      d. Because of the age range of our ENL program (Kindergarten-5th grade), there are no Long Term ELLs (those who have been  receiving services for 7 or more years). If a child is approaching long-term ELL status, the ENL teacher would consult with  the RTI team and the classroom teacher.  A variety of pre-referral intervention strategies would be offered.  If there was no  improvement, the child would be at Tier 1.  After a number of months, the the PPT would decide if a referral to the Committee  on Special Education for a bilingual evaluation would be warranted, to determine the possibility of a learning disability.      e. Former ELLs have passed the NYSESLAT, but still receive support in the classroom. This support is provided  through testing accommodations including small group setting and bilingual glossaries or dictionaries.  Instructional  differentiation in the classroom may include any of the differentiation used for developing ELLs, according to students'  individual strengths and needs.  Vocabulary support, graphic organizers, accountable talk stems and other tools that ELLs can  use by themselves even during non-ENL periods are most helpful for commanding students. These allow students to help  themselves and continue improving their language skills even when an ENL teacher is not present.         6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   One instructional strategy that we have found helpful for ELL-SWDs, which is also in alignment with the Common Core  Standards, is the focus on the development of Academic Language, specifically Tier 2 and Tier 3 words.  Another instructional  strategy is the use of thinking maps, such as the tree map, the circle map and the brace map, since they help special education  ELLs organize non-fiction material in a meaningful way.  Finally, students are given opportunities to use technology in the  classroom to build their English language development and have multiple entry points for students with a variety of learning  styles. The ENL classroom and special education classrooms have extensive libraries of fiction and non-fiction material, on a  variety of reading levels and subject matter, to encourage our special education ELLs during during independent reading. The  ENL teacher tries to focus on vocabulary development in the content areas of mathematics, science and social studies in order  to make the language of grade level textbooks more comprehensible to these children.  Another instructional strategy is the  placement of bilingual paraprofessionals to entitled special education ELLs.  These paraprofessionals are fluent in the child's  native language and often translate important information, which facilitates the child's comprehension of the curriculum, and  help them try and meet the standards in literacy and the content areas. Currently we have one ELL-SWD who has a bilingual  paraprofessional.  All of these strategies and tools allow ELL-SWDs to be educated in the least restrictive environment  possible.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Both Stand-alone and integrated ENL are used to enable ELL-SWDs to acquire English and meet IEP mandates in the least  restrictive environment possible. Pull-out, stand-alone ENL class is a mainstreaming experience for the special education ELLs,  since they are grouped together by chronological age and by language proficiency with general education ELLs.  Some of our  ELL-SWDs are in self-contained classrooms, and the ENL class gives them an opportunity to function in a  less restrictive  environment.  Our school uses the Teachers College Readers and Writers Workshop Model which gives these students the  opportunity to read unit-specific fiction and non-fiction texts on their instructional level, rather than their grade level. This  built-in differentiation allows ELL-SWDs to fully participate in their grade-level content while receiving the supports and  scaffolds they are entitled to.   Push-in and integrated ENL is also used to help ELL-SWDs meet their ENL and IEP mandates.  In  a push-in setting, ELL-SWDs receive unobtrusive scaffolds and supports for them to learn English while remaining in their  optimal classroom setting.  We make our ENL schedules work so that students get the appropriate number of ENL minutes  within the least restrictive classroom environment.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Our school has a variety of targeted interventions for the various ELL subgroups.  All struggling ELLs, whether SIFE, Newcomer  or Developing, are provided with differentiation and/or scaffolding of topics in their general education classroom and during  ENL.  Newcomer and Developing ELL students who have been in our school and/or country for more than two years (or  struggle to comprehend and achieve academically in their first language as well) may be considered for RTI services.  However,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      the RTI Team is always careful to consult with the ENL department before making any decisions about an ELL receiving RTI or a  Special Education Evaluation.  Academic and RTI interventions may include working with a push-in or pull-out RTI teacher in  small groups or individually, working with a reading specialist using The Leveled Literacy Program, At-Risk SETSS in ELA or  Math, or Great Leaps. All of our RTI and Intervention teachers are trained to work with ELLs using ENL strategies and  techniques, and to consider second language acquisition issues when evaluating and working with ELLs. Also, our newcomer  ELLs in the upper grades receive additional support in ELA through the before school Title III individual prescriptive  program.  This program includes an assessment-based computer literacy and phonics program and social interaction skills  training using games and speaking activities.  By using games and literacy training, both BICS (Basic Interpersonal  Communication Skills) and CALP (Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency) language skills are addressed during this Title III  program in a friendly, small-group environment.  Finally, our long term general and special education ELLs receive extra help in  literacy and math by a certified teacher through a small group setting or pushing into the classroom during the day. These  interventions are offered in English with native language support available through bilingual staff members when possible.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?       This year, the ENL department introduced a social-skills and game-playing workshop to our Morning Program, based on trends  noticed among newcomer ELLs at the school.  Classroom teachers and ENL teachers noticed that many newcomer ELLs were  not socializing with their peers or interacting in the classroom setting with teachers and other students.  While this is a normal  stage of language acquisition, the Morning program is a warm and safe environment for ELLs to gain valuable speaking practice  in addition to receiving academic support.  It can be overwhelming to participate in a whole-class setting with mostly native- English speaking peers, so the Morning program was adjusted to meet the need that our ELLs demonstrated.  This program  was implemented late in the school year on a trial basis to see if it is something we want to add to the Title III program on a  long term basis.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   P.S. 144 has not had a bilingual program, due small numbers of ELLs per grade and to the linguistic diversity of our community.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs.  Notices such as trip slips are also sent home in the native language to  better inform parents of ELLs.  Our Parents Association has a professionally maintained website with the latest news and  weekly e-mails are sent by the Parent Coordinator.  Many of the members of the Executive Board of the Parents Association  are also bilingual, and are always willing to translate for our newcomer ELL parents and/or children.     A before school Title III program is offered to our upper grade ELLs and to new admits throughout the school year. This  program uses technology to improve listening and reading comprehension skills and speaking activities to help welcome ELLs  into the school community. Over the summer there is also a DOE program offered to students, ELL Summer in the City. This  program provides ELLs with free, fun learning opportunities in math, science, reading and writing. Students will participate in  activities to help strengthen their social and academic skills while engaging in interactive learning experiences.       ELL students also have access to the after school program at our school, which is run by teachers and the YMCA  and available  to all students after school every day.  Through this program, ELLs are able to participate in a wide variety of professionally-run  activities including music, technology, strategy games, theater, arts and crafts, Soccer Friends, Bakers and Shakers, piano, sign  language, sports, and Spanish.  These activities expose ELLs to areas of English other than academics.      In addition, like all students at our school, ELLs have the opportunity to participate in visual and performing arts residencies  through the Queens Museum of Art.  In 2017-2018, P.S. 144 will again be the recipient of the New York State Council on the  Arts Grant.  This money provides us with a partnership with the Queens Museum of Art, which allows us to bring architecture  and visual arts residencies into the classrooms.  We also have our partnership with the Guggenheim Museum of Art.  This  unique residency, which lasts for twenty weeks, brings a teaching artist into all the third grade classrooms.The teaching artist  develops unique art projects, in conjunction with the academic curriculum an current exhibitions at the museum.  Finally, our  ELLs also benefit from other art residencies with such New York City cultural institutions as the American Ballroom Dance  Theatre.  These residencies in the performing arts expose our children to music, dance and theatre and are especially   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      beneficial to our ELLs, since they give them the opportunity to communicate their thoughts and feelings without having to use  oral and/or written language.  The ELLs can feel extremely successful in the arts, even though they may be struggling to meet  academic standards in the classroom.  Also, hands on science residencies are provided and afford our ELLs another opportunity  to demonstrate their scientific knowledge, despite difficulties that newcomer ELLs may face in learning the science curriculum.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Since P.S. 144 is a member of the Teachers College Reading and Writing Project, our major instructional materials are large  collections of leveled libraries in each classroom.  Through the use of these libraries of fiction and non fiction books, from  Levels A through Q, all ELLs have an opportunity to improve their phonemic skills, increase their social and academic  vocabulary, and develop reading fluency. Even newcomer ELLs in older grades are able to find "just-right" levelled books along  with more challenging books that native-language peers may be reading.    Big Books and picture books are used during Shared Reading to develop vocabulary, improve reading fluency and increase  reading comprehension.  The ENL teacher also uses the Scott Foresman ESL Series as supplemental resource for newcomer and  developing ELLs, to increase academic vocabulary, since it makes the content areas more meaningful for the English language  learner. The ENL teachers also use Newcomer Phonics to support older newcomer students as they quickly acquire the  phonics, phonemics and decoding skills necessary to participate in the grade level curriculum.  Fundations is also used in lower  grades classrooms where there are tool kits to help students build their literacy skills.  In addition, the ENL teacher uses test  preparation materials and workbooks, specifically designed to familiarize children with the different components of the  NYSESLAT and make them comfortable with the format of the test.  Also, ENL teachers use a wide variety of teacher-created  scaffolds, resources and strategies, including word banks, visual vocabulary, word walls with pictures, graphic organizers,  manipulatives, sentence starters, cloze texts, centers, dry erase boards, anchor charts, tapping into prior knowledge, videos,  music and labels.      Finally, technology plays an important role in the classroom, the computer room and in the ENL room.  Certain websites such  as Starfall, Learning A-Z and ABC Mouse are very helpful for our newcomers to develop phonemic skills.  Newsela and Read  Write Think are useful for our transitioning, expanding and commanding ELLs since it teaches them how to map a story, how  characters develop and change in a story, and also how to write personal and persuasive essays. These resources include the  tools, thinking maps and graphic organizers that scaffold upper-grades material and allow older ELLs to participate in the  grade-level curriculum.  Brain Pop is a website which is provided for all students and teachers at our school.  It includes a vast  library of engaging video lessons, visuals, activities, and quizzes for each lesson.   Our school also subscribes to Myon for all  students and teachers.  Myon is an online levelled library which includes books on a variety of topics and genres to interest  ELLs. Students can also have the books read out loud to them (very helpful for ELLs) and allows teachers to log in and check  students' progress and assign books to them.  Another technology program used for ELLs is MindPlay. MindPlay is a phonics,  fluency and reading comprehension computer program administered during the Title III Morning program. Mango and Little  Pim are additional English language acquisition programs.  This year, a new way that ENL teachers have been keeping parents  up to date this year on their students' language development progress is through an app that allows teachers to share videos  of student work along with recordings of students reading their own work.  This allows ELL parents to feel truly involved,  facilitates speaking and writing progress for students and instills a sense of pride in ELLs when their parents can see how much  English they have learned.  Finally, all classrooms have had Smartboards and Smart Document Cameras installed which allows  for a variety of differentiation, the use of visuals and tactile interactions for all lessons.       13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   In our freestanding ENL program, immersion in an English speaking environment helps the children develop oral and written  language quickly.  The native language is used by the ENL teacher and the classroom buddies to translate unfamiliar vocabulary  and difficult concepts to the newcomer.  For older ELLs who have received native language academic instruction in their home  country, bilingual math and science glossaries and bilingual dictionaries are provided to further their understanding of the  subject matter. Students receive explicit instruction in how to use these tools to help themselves in the classroom setting and  at home to improve their language skills.  Bilingual books are also used during literacy to enable the newcomer to feel more  comfortable in the classroom environment.  Also, the website www.childrenslibrary.org is used to translate picture books into   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      different languages. Finally, parents are a valuable source of home language support for students, and they are encouraged to  continue reading, writing, and speaking to their children in their first language at home.           14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Different services, support and resources are targeted for different ages and grade levels.  For example, all our struggling ELLs  are considered for push-in intervention services and are given small group instruction and differentiated models of  learning.  All required services and resources are delivered according to ELLs' ages and grade levels through careful  collaboration with classroom/grade level teachers.  ENL Teachers have access to Reading, Writing, Social Studies, Science and  Math curriculums for the year and the ENL teachers attend grade level planning meetings and professional development  during afterschool professional development time and prep periods.  ENL teachers use these curriculums to plan and teach  horizontally aligned material. In addition, we have different art residencies for different ages and grades. For example, our  kindergarteners participate in a dance residency, the first graders are involved with a drama residency, the second graders  create and produce plays with puppets, our fourth graders participate in a bookingmaking residency, and our fifth graders  participate in a ballroom dance residency.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    We do not share a building.        16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   There will be no formal services provided to newly enrolled ELLs prior to the opening of school in September, since our school  does not offer summer school.  However,  inform the parents about the availability of ENL services in the building as soon as  they enroll.  Every attempt is made to provide a newcomer ELL with a classroom buddy, who speaks their native language.  The  ENL teacher enlists the aid of parents who speak the newcomers’ language, in order to familiarize them with the American  educational system and the community.  During the previous school year, in June, the Parent Coordinator holds an orientation  for all incoming parents of Kindergarteners where they are welcomed and given an overview of what is to come in  Kindergarten.  At this orientation the principal, nurse, and ENL teacher are also present to share information with the parents  and welcome them.  Also in June, an Open House is provided for incoming Kindergarten students where the children, including  ELLs, get a chance to come in while a current Kindergarten class is being held so they can observe what takes place and what  to expect in the classroom.    There is always an open line of communication via phone or e-mail for any questions regarding the ELL identification process  between parents and the ENL coordinator.  In September, a parent orientation is held for parents of newly enrolled ELLs to  meet with the ENL teachers, learn about ENL program options, and register their program preference. These orientations also  occur throughout the school year, within 10 days of a new ELL student enrolling (excluding ELL-SWDs, who attend an  orientation within 20 days of registering). For any other questions throughout the school year, parents can always contact the  Parent Coordinator, who provides information on activities held both inside our school and in the community.       17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?     There are no language electives offered to any of our students during the school day.  However, we have a very extensive  after school program run by teachers and the YMCA, where Spanish has been offered, and other foreign languages may be  offered in the future.      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59         d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Professional development for all teachers of ELLs is continually ongoing at P.S. 144.  Our school schedule has been modified in  order to allow time for classroom teachers to meet and plan with each other and with the ENL teacher during common preps  and professional development time.  This time is used to discuss how best to plan lessons and differentiate instruction for our  ELLs.  Suggestions are made to bilingual para-professionals about how to incorporate the use of the native language, in order  to foster understanding of key concepts in mathematics, science and social studies.  In addition, professional development is  provided to these para-professionals on English phonics, morphology and syntax, and suggestions are also given on how to  improve the decoding skills, vocabulary and comprehension of our special education ELLs.    In order to ensure that all teachers at our school understand their role as teachers of ELLs, the ENL teachers create and present  their own Professional Development workshops. Before designing these workshops, ENL teachers will target specific areas that  will most benefit the school's ELL students and their teachers, based on experiences and findings in the classroom and  collaboration with classroom teachers. Currently, the focus of the ENL professional development series has been on how to  best help newcomer ELLs in the general education classroom.  All teachers in the school attended a workshop to learn  research-based strategies, information and skills to help these students. Examples and resources were provided as well.     Also, during after school professional development time, all out of classroom teachers have the opportunity to meet and  collaborate.  Teachers take turns leading the meeting and sharing ways to integrate their subject matter across the curriculum.  They compare student data and solicit feedback, to ensure ELLs and all other students are receiving appropriate differentiation  and scaffolds in all classrooms and subject areas.    There is also collaboration with other ENL teachers within the school district and community both formally and informally.  ENL  teachers attend Queens South Field Support Center ELL Team Professional Development Workshops regularly together and  collaborate informally throughout the school year to support each other.  DELLSS also offers many professional development  workshops for ENL teachers throughout the year that are attended.  In addition, the ENL teachers participate in the  professional development offered at the school during clerical days and afterschool professional development.  Every month,  the classroom teachers and ENL teachers meet with the staff developer from Teacher's College, Reading and Writing program.  They meet as a grade with the staff developer to receive staff development support. This includes ELL strategies within the  literacy lessons.  The ENL teacher also participates in school wide professional development.  Teachers are provided with  trainings throughout the year in supporting all students as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards.  For example,  teachers are encouraged to visit engageny.org which provides resources for teachers to use.  The ENL teachers also  provide turn keys for other teachers within the building.   Teachers also receive professional development on Depth of  Knowledge levels and Blooms Taxonomy, which will help teachers when planning lessons for all different learners, aligned with  the Common Core Standards.  Finally, our new teachers and any other teachers who would like, are always given the  opportunity to observe and create together an ENL lesson, and/or watch a modeled lesson to incorporate differentiations and  interventions for ELLs and further their understanding of the difficulties facing the English language learner.           2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  All teachers will attend 15% ELL specific professional developments and ENL teachers will attend 50%, whether they be in- school and/or outside-school professional developments.   Many of our newer staff members receive ESL/ENL training by  attending workshops sponsored by Teachers College.  The ELL population is targeted by scaffolding the different units of  Readers and Writers Workshop. Each teacher receives a certificate from Teachers College after completion of the  workshop.  Other workshops are offered where the teachers are given strategies on how to differentiate instruction for all  students including ELLs.  All teachers and ENL teachers attend workshops offered through DELLS.  The ENL teacher also  provides turn keys and professional developments about ELLs for other teachers within the building.   All ENL teachers will  attend professional developments through opportunities offered by DELLS.  This includes NYCDOE workshops or workshops  from other sources.  Some of these workshops will include all teachers, not just ENL.  Many of our newer staff members  receive ENL training by attending workshops sponsored by Teachers College.  The ELL population is targeted by scaffolding the  different units of Readers and Writers Workshop. Each teacher receives a certificate from Teachers College after completion of  the workshop.  Other workshops are given where the teachers are given strategies on how to differentiate instruction for all  students and co-teach/collaborate with the ENL teacher.  The ENL teacher also turn keys and provides workshops for teachers  focusing on ELLs, how to support ELLs using different entry points and offer any resources throughout the year to help  classroom teachers on how to build Academic Language for ELLs, and also how to expand their vocabulary from Basic  Interpersonal Communication to Tier 2 and Tier 3 Words. This takes place during our afternoon PD time.      Part of the 15% for all teachers is provided by the ENL teachers.  In order to ensure that all teachers at our school understand  their role as teachers of ELLs, the ENL teachers create and present their own Professional Development workshops. Before  designing these workshops, ENL teachers will target specific areas that will most benefit the school's ELL students and their  teachers, based on experiences and findings in the classroom and collaboration with classroom teachers. Currently, the focus  of the ENL professional development series has been on how to best help newcomer ELLs in the general education  classroom.  All teachers in the school attended a workshop to learn research-based strategies, information and skills to help  these students. Examples and resources were provided as well.     At each PD or meeting, an agenda is given as an overview of what will be discussed, possible powerpoints, articles,  and worksheets are provided and attendance taken.          Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Every week the teachers are given time to connect and meet with parents.  This may be through in-person meetings, email, or  phone calls, whichever is more convenient for the parents.  Translators/translations are used when needed through the  translation and interpretation unit or staff/volunteers within the school.  This is a time to discuss the goals, language  development progress, supports, language proficiency and other assessment results, and development in language and  content areas.  A log is kept by the ENL teacher to make sure it is documented when these meetings take place at least once a  year and notes about the meeting are recorded. Language proficiency results are shared with newcomer students' families  through a letter sent home and the parent orientation in September. ELLs who enroll throughout the year also receive  language proficiency results (NYSITELL) through a letter and orientations that occur within 10 days of their registration and  testing.  Returning ELLs will receive NYSESLAT results through a letter sent home in the fall.  A workshop is also given by the  ENL teacher for parents before the NYSESLAT in the spring.  This informs the parents and family on what to expect, how it  affects their child, and how to help prepare for the upcoming exam.   In addition, the ENL teacher is invited by other teachers  to participate in any meetings held with ELL parents.  Together they can meet with parents and share common thoughts and  concerns of how we can all work together to help meet the needs of their child.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61         2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Parents are an important part of the learning process, and parental involvement at P.S. 144 is encouraged in a friendly and  nurturing environment.  The ENL teacher always attends the spring and fall Kindergarten Orientation meetings in order to  acquaint parents with our ESL/ENL program.  As soon as children are identified as ELLs, their parents are invited to attend a  Parent Orientation meeting, where they view a video in English and in their native language.  At this meeting, parents are given  information about state standards, city and state assessments, school expectations, and general program requirements.  These  Parent Orientation meetings are held at different times of the day, in order to accommodate working parents. If registration  warrants it, additional orientation meetings will be scheduled throughout the school year.   Every week we are given time to connect with parents  through email, phone, letters or in person meetings.  Translators/translations are used when needed through the translation and interpretation unit or staff/volunteers within the  school. This is a time to discuss the goals, progress, need support, assessments and development in language and content  areas.  A log is kept by the ENL teacher to make sure it is documented when these meetings take place and what it was  about.  A workshop is also given by the ENL teacher for parents before the NYSESLAT in the spring.  This informs the parents  and family on what to expect, how it affects their child, and how to help prepare for the upcoming exam.   In addition, the ENL  teacher is invited by other teachers to participate in their meetings with parents.  Together they can meet with parents and  share common thoughts and concerns of how we can all work together to help meet the needs of their child.       In addition, Parent Teacher conferences are scheduled during the year, in the afternoon and also in the evening.    Parents are always invited to attend school performances and multi-cultural holiday celebrations and Field Days.    Translators are available at parent conferences, workshops and Parent Association meetings.  Important school notices, such  as lunch forms and upcoming standardized tests, are sent home in a variety of different languages to accommodate our  diverse school community.  Our Parent Coordinator has been instrumental in promoting communication between the parents of our ELLs and our school  community.  She provides weekly updates to parents about important school and community events on our Parents  Association website, and regularly hosts workshops on topics of interest to our school community.  Our ELL parents have the opportunity to participate in school wide activities.  The Parents Association offers many  supplementary and fundraising activities which allow ELL parents to interact with the entire school community.  Parents are  encouraged to participate and support school wide events such as Halloween Party, school auction, International Day, holiday  boutique, carnival, etc.   The ENL department also sends home monthly ENL newsletters in English and other languages to keep parents up to date on  upcoming school and ENL class events, what students are working on, and ideas for home activities to support second  language acquisition and promote bilingualism. These ENL newsletters can also be accessed by parents on the ENL teachers'  websites and is in addition to informal e-mail communication with parents anytime they have a question or concern.    One new way that ENL teachers have been keeping parents up to date this year on their students' language development  progress is through an app that allows teachers to share videos of student work along with recordings of students reading their  own work.  This allows ELL parents to feel truly involved, facilitates speaking and writing progress for students and instills a  sense of pride in ELLs when their parents can see how much English they have learned.     Finally, ELL parents are invited into the school to learn English themselves through a parent ENL program.  This weekday and  weekend program is run by a bilingual licensed teacher and the Parent Coordinator to help parents learn English, come  together as a community to help each other, and become accustomed to the local and school culture.  They go on a variety of  field trips, take English lessons, and celebrate their achievements. Separately, the parent coordinator also runs a workshop  every September showing bilingual parents how to navigate the NYC DOE website. All of these efforts ensure that ELL parents  are just as involved in the school community as their monolingual peers.       Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.    PS 144 is a truly an exceptional place for ELLs to learn English, and the success of our program can be seen both quantitatively and  qualitatively.   First, we can measure ELLs' achievements quantitatively by examining their scores on the NYSESLAT.  Currently, 36%  (26 out of 73) of our ELLs are at a commanding level, indicating they have become academically proficient in English.  Of those 26   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62                       commanding students, 88% (23) passed the test in 3 years or less. We believe this success can be attributed to a variety of factors,  including high parent involvement, exceptional arts and residency enrichments, frequent field trips around the city, warm and  supportive classroom environments, technology, a Title III program, collaboration between the ENL department and other teachers  and a supportive administration.    Aside from examining quantitative data, we can also see the success of our program by observing our students in and out of the  classroom. This can be seen socially and academically.  In the classroom, many of our students become acclimated quickly. Seeing  an ELL or a former ELL participate in school wide events such as contests, talent shows, and performances on stage in front of a  large group indicates that they are successfully integrated into our school community, and are achieving on a social and emotional  level too.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63   Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.                     In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Reva Gluck Schneider, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   P.S.144 Jeromus Remsen                                                                              School DBN: 28Q144  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      Call bilingual parents using the over the phone Translation & Interpretation services. Next, use other available  resources and e-mail parents-- parents use e-mail translation services to translate school e-mails.             Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      Teachers within the school are informed verbally at staff meetings and through email about the different available  options for translation and interpretation which they can use when needed. It is told to them at the beginning of the  school year, and they are reminded again before parent teacher conferences.           Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)

Parents are required to complete HLIS  when first registering and also to complete emergency card where preferred language is indicated. Multilingual  Language Welcome Poster is prominently located by the front entrance for parents to understand the availability of  translation services at our school. In our main office we also have Parent's Guide to Language Access brochures which  explains parents' rights and options for language services at this school. When possible all notifications will be given to  students' in the language requested by the parent where we will use our school staff to translate orally to parents.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       In previous years, we have reached out to parents through a survey to inform us on how they want the school  communication, whether that be via email, paper, or over the phone. We will continue to do the same. Many of our  parents have elected either email or a translated copy of correspondence we send home.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69
