The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.   In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a   2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       7     comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement    NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality   2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       8     Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.     Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: New this year, instead of self-rating, in Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the   Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that  received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) School Review should use the recommendations from the  review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the   2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       9      major findings/recommendations from your most recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and  other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       10      Section 4: SCEP Overview      1.

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       12         Progress/Areas of Focus:   Progress: As per our 2018 feedback from the office of the Superintendent, our strength area is Quality Indicator 4.2 -  Teacher Teams. This indicator aligns to Collaborative Teachers element within the Framework for Great School. The  superintendent state that... “all teachers collaborate on professional teams where they develop and implement  school wide instructional practices related to school goals”. The superintendent’s office also noted that, “the schools  instructional planning team regularly collaborates with administration to develop professional learning opportunities  for themselves and the larger school community to address school-wide noticings from data reviews and classroom  walkthroughs. All of these practices have resulted in creating a culture of trust, teacher buy-in, and ownership for  their own learning.”      Area of Focus:   According to the feedback provided, our next steps are to continue supporting teachers to establish a common  understanding of what planning for high levels of student thinking, participation, and ownership looks like for all  students.” Our superintendent identified Quality Indicator 1.1 and 1.2, as our area of focus, which aligns to rigorous  instruction in the Framework for Great Schools. Superintendent suggests that our instructional planning team  collaboratively redesign our lesson planning templates to better align to our school-wide instructional focus. Moving  forward, we will ensure that our template allows teachers space to identify the assessment criteria, plan to modify  instruction in the moment based on checks for understanding, and highlight how they are creating greater student  ownership and accountability throughout the lesson.                      2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       13         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 07X369   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   261   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   YES   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious  intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. (Aligned to DTSDE Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support)    Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Part 1a.  Alignment to DTSDE Statements of Practice  Tenet 3 Statement of Practice  Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the  appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan.  3.2   The school leader ensures and supports the quality implementation of a systematic plan of  rigorous and coherent curricula appropriately aligned to the Common Core Learning  Standards (CCLS) that is monitored and adapted to meet the needs of students.  Teachers develop and ensure that unit and lesson plans used include data-driven instruction  (DDI) protocols that are appropriately aligned to the CCLS and NYS content standards and  address student achievement needs.  The school leader and teachers have developed a comprehensive plan for teachers to partner  within and across all grades and subjects to create interdisciplinary curricula targeting the  arts, technology, and other enrichment opportunities.  Teachers implement a comprehensive system for using formative and summative  assessments for strategic short and long-range curriculum planning that involves student  reflection, tracking of, and ownership of learning.   3.3   3.4   3.5   SOP(s)   Addressed   X               Part 1b.

For example, data sources  should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review,  NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School  Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly.     1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and   year.   2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.      Strength in Rigorous Instruction:   Teachers utilize pre and post assessments in reading, writing, and math. Teachers set goals for their students based  off of these various assessments and are becoming more attuned to the content and why students may be struggling  in the ways they are. For example, in reading, teachers have strengthened their understanding of specific  characteristics at each reading level so they are better able to communicate with their students what specifically they  need to work on in order to progress. Last year while working with Teacher's College, teachers focused on using  assessment data to develop their guided reading instruction, conferring, and targeted small group instruction. Based  on our 2017-2018 NYS ELA data, our TC -aligned data-driven ELA practices positively impacted our student  achievement as evident by an 18% increase of levels 3 and level 4 performance. While working with our  Metamorphosis and NTN staff developers, we used our Go-Math assessment data to identify students’ areas of need.  By working with our math staff developer to unpack CCLS content standards and mathematical practices, teachers  were able to redesigned their math blocks to include multiple opportunities for students to develop mathematical  understanding. Teachers supported students to develop their conceptual mathematical understanding by  implementing targeted CCLS-aligned math games, routines and investigations to address students learning gaps.   2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       16      Based on our 2017-2018 NYS Math data, our revised math practices positively impacted our instruction as a evident  by our 19% increase of students performing levels 3 and 4.       Need in Rigorous Instruction:   Although our teachers administer pre and post assessments in their literacy and mathematics curriculum, our  students are not consistently, reflect on their progress utilizing checklists, rubrics and peer feedback specifically in  math . An area for growth is to have the students be more active participants in their goal-setting, creation of action  plans and reflection. In order for students to develop, they must take ownership of learning. Our goal as a school  community, is to ensure that we plan opportunity in our instruction for students to reflect on their own attainments  utilizing a rigorous, CCLS aligned curriculum that incorporates routine formative and summative assessments,  student-goal setting and reflection.                  Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Rigorous Instruction. Your goal must be responsive to the identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   By June 2019, teacher lesson plans will include student self-assessment strategies (ie: checklist, rubrics, reflections,  and/or peer feedback) that support students assessing their own mastery of higher-order thinking Math CCLS - aligned  tasks as evident by a 15% increase of grade 3 students achieving math proficiency as measured by Ready NYS Test  Simulation.            2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       17     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for this  Framework for Great Schools element, including:   Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

For example, data sources  should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review,  NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School  Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly.     1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and   year.   2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?      Strength in Supportive Environment:   According to our Spring 2018 Learning Environment Survey, Young Leaders Elementary School (YLE) has developed a  significant amount of celebration areas. Over 90% of teachers have trust for the school leadership and for the other  teachers that they work with in the school. Our data also reveals that 100% of our teachers say that our students are  safe in their classrooms and the majority of our students do their work when they are suppose to. The safe, positive  learning environment that we foster is maintained with support from our partnership with Positive Learning  Collaborative (PLC). PLC's model provides support through a holistic approach where every adult in the school is  prepared with the skills and tools they need to guide the successful development and learning of all children. PLC  provides the school with both extensive training and the development of an individual action plan based on an  assessment of the school's needs and priorities. They support the implementation of Positive Behavior Interventions  and Support and provide direct consultation for faculty and administration.       2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       22      The majority of our staff have received Cornell’s 4-day certification course, Therapeutic Crisis Intervention in Schools.  This curriculum is designed to teach educators how to help students learn constructive and adaptive ways to deal with  feelings such as frustration, failure, anger, rejection, hurt and depression. TCIS also prepares educators to effectively  respond to challenging student behavior. YLE believe that change can only truly occur when the entire school  community shares a common language around behavior, thus creating internal systems that support the adults as they  are teaching and students as they are learning. All school community members (administrators, teachers,  paraprofessionals, school aides, etc.) complete TCIS training over a period of time.As of our 2017-2018 suspension data,  less than 20 in-house principal suspensions have been given for as a consequence for unsafe behavior. By working with  PLC we will further develop proactive strategies to strengthen our positive learning environment and decrease the  number for suspensions.       YLE uses positive reinforcement to prevent challenging student behavior and promote a positive school climate. At YLE,  Social Emotional Learning is embedded in the ELA curriculum during Community Circle time daily to enhance student  emotional competence. In addition, YLE has used PLC's in-depth staff survey to measure and analyze school climate  twice during the course of the academic year. We have collaborated with PLC to develop a faculty driven action plan  that address areas of need identified in the staff survey results. This process facilitates the opportunity for faculty to  participate in the school's decision making process. As a result of our efforts over 90% of our staff reported on the last  PLC survey, that they feel valued and listened to.       Need in Supportive Environment:    Our data identifies that teachers are concerned about our students' approaches to learning. According to the Learning  Environment Survey, 24% of teachers responded that students provide constructive feedback to their peers and  teachers. Also, 52% of teachers say that the students in their classes try hard to get good grades. An area for growth is  to have our students take increased ownership over their own learning. In order for students to assume accountability  for their own learning, we need to develop a culture that promotes student accountability and ownership. It is our goal  to have students become active participants in setting their own goals in the following areas: academic, social- emotional, and work habits. Our students will work closely with their teachers to create action plans that will be used  better support students in meeting their identified goals. We will give students routine opportunities to progress  monitor and reflect on their own progress by analyzing their own products using a portfolio system. Students will also  be responsible to present their own work during student-led conferences.            Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools –Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.      By June 2019, staff will establish student-centered classroom cultures that encourages student to take increased  ownership of their own learning through the use of: goal setting, self-assessment and peer-feedback. Progress will be  determined by at a 25% increase of reading proficiency in grade 5 as measured by TCRWP running records.       2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       23               2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       24   Key Personnel  Who is responsible  for implementing  and overseeing the  activity/strategy?

To improve pedagogical practices school-wide, Young Leaders Elementary School believes in offering a range of high- quality professional development opportunities. We design our professional development to provide teachers  opportunities to collectively work together to develop a shared understanding of effective and highly effective teacher  practice (such as: learning walks, coaching cycles, classroom inter-visitations, and study groups). Through these  practices, teachers engage in meaningful conversation to norm expectations, and identify actionable next steps needed  to meet individual and school-wide goals. At YLE, our instructional leaders work collaboratively with consultants and  staff developers to ensure that all teachers have numerous opportunities to professional support through resources  inside and outside of our building.   Our priority need is to ensure that there are consistent use of an inquiry approach across the teams. As per our Quality  Review, “...Although school leadership encourages shared leadership and focuses on improved student learning, teacher  team work does not typically result in improved teacher practice or progress toward goals for groups of students”.

Our Learning Environment Survey indicates that in 2017-2018, 97% of our families agreed or strongly agreed that  teachers work closely with them to meet their child’s needs. This year we have doubled the amount of evening parent  involvement events and teacher-led parent meetings. With the help of our strong parent coordinator and community  advocate, we’ve supported our teachers in their communications with families through meetings, phone calls, letters  and home visits. We work to include our families in special events such as music concerts, showcases in our after-school  programming, field trips and so on. We work in collaboration with our parents to strengthen the learning at home by  providing books, workshops, and additional resources to support parents in growing their child's at-home libraries. In  the 2017-2018 school year, our average turn-out for PA meetings ranged between 10-15 attendees. This year, as per our  parent coordinator, our numbers have continued to increase. Our last PA meeting had 23 parents in attendance. With  concerted effort in communication, providing growth opportunities for our parents themselves, and incorporating our  parents with engaging experiences with their children, we will be able to maintain increasing our parent involvement.

ELT provides enriching  educational experiences that happen outside of the traditional school day and blend skill acquisition, relationship- building and fun to foster academic and social-emotional growth. Summer learning, afterschool programming, and  extended-day ELT models, when well-implemented, play a critical role in supporting students in all grades and ensuring  that they graduate from high school, college and career ready. SED requires that Priority schools offer a minimum of 200  additional student contact hours as Expanded Learning Time in addition to the current mandated length of 900 hours of  instruction per year (25 hours per week) in grades K-6 and 990 hours of instruction per year (27.5 hours per week) in  grades 7-12. Effective ELT models will blend school staff with community partners, and will provide a balanced  curriculum that can include ELA, Math, STEM, arts, physical activity, and leadership development. Complete the sections  on this page to demonstrate how the school will meet these requirements.     Part 1 – ELT Program Goal(s)   Describe the summative goal(s) of the ELT program for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to be  SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.       By December 2018, all students identified as at-risk will receive additional instructional learning time through:  extended learning time on Saturdays, after school and/or vacation breaks. At-risk students will be identified via on- going assessments: NYS data, TC running records, iReady, and formative assessments.           Part 2 – ELT Program Type    Is the ELT program voluntary or compulsory?   X   Voluntary      Compulsory   If the ELT program is voluntary, indicate how you will actively encourage the participation of all students, with the  goal of serving at least 50% of students.   We are choosing the phrasing “Opt-out” versus “Opt-in” when communicating if the programming is required or not.  This is the first step to encourage participation by all students, as it will be a majority of the students that do choose  to stay. To increase engagement, we will ensure there is choice when considering what arts partnerships for our after  school programming. For example, our students developed a love of percussion this past year when working with  CCCDAI. Using our Extended Learning Time to provide different types of opportunities, both academic support and  enrichment, will motivate students to stay and actively participate. We have also developed a relationship with Roads  to Success, and they will continue to organize and run “vacation camps” to reward those students that are putting  forth great effort during our Saturday school programming and our after school programming.        Part 3 – ELT Program Description    Target Population: The ELT program will be offered to all students in the school, with the goal of serving a minimum  of fifty percent of students.  Describe how the school will meet the following SED requirements for an ELT program in a Priority School:     Integrate academics, enrichment, and skill development through hands-on experiences that make learning  relevant and engaging.     Offer a range of activities that capture student interest and strengthen student engagement in learning so as to   promote higher attendance, reduce risk for retention or drop out, and increase the likelihood of graduation.     Actively address the unique learning needs and interests of all types of students, especially those who may   benefit from approaches and experiences not offered in the traditional classroom setting.   2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       61        Contain components designed to improve student academic, social, and emotional outcomes, including   opportunities for enrichment programs such as in music and art.     Ensure instruction in any core academic subject offered in the program will be delivered under the supervision of   a teacher who is NYS certified in that particular content area.     Engage in outreach activities made to families.      The plan to integrate academics, enrichment and skill development through the arts and hands-on experiences that  will make learning relevant and engaging by frequently introducing students to learning activities. For example in  math, these activities will implore students to use manipulatives, drawings, models and other strategies to explain  their thinking and rationale for making certain decisions and taking certain steps. This approach will bring learning to  life.   We plan to offer a range of activities to capture students’ interests and strengthen their engagement in learning and  to improve attendance. Activities will range from technology club, basketball, chess, film-making, STEM, soccer,  percussion and cycling. These activities will not just increase the students’ engagement, but they will provide  enrichment opportunities for our students to become well-rounded learners with a greater appreciation for the arts.   In order to meet individual student needs, teachers will utilize technological software that is paced to the strengths  and needs of the learner. The software we are planning to utilize is iReady, a new software that has earned the praise  of educators and those in technology world. We will continue to use iReady also for a math intervention, and both  Imagine Learning and myON to support our students in their phonological awareness, word recognition and reading  comprehension.   Independent and sustained reading is an important focus in our Extended Learning Time. Every student in grades 2-5  will have a 30 minute reading block every day in after school. The after school teachers will sign-off on every  student’s log on a daily basis and students will earn DOJO points and other incentives for meeting stamina and  volume goals. We noticed last school year that the students were partaking in their “assigned reading homework” on  a nightly basis. Therefore we will be scheduling in our extended learning time to ensure that all students are able to  progress as readers through engaging with texts multiple times a day and integrated a school-wide "Reading Stamina  Challenge". This year the leadership team will develop additional school-wide reading challenges to motivate our  most reluctant readers.   NYC Read Alliance, a partner with United Way will be a part of the students’ ELT experience. Read Alliance’s mission  statement reads: Read Alliance works to improve the educational trajectory of at-risk kindergarten and first grade  students through one-to-one tutoring in foundational reading skills. Through this partnership we were able to offer  40 at risk.   All teachers on Saturdays who work for the Extended Learning Time program will be full time NYC Department of  Education teachers. These teachers will be given weekly opportunities to common plan as well as professional  development to further enhance their practice. During the after school hours, there will be some DOE employees on  staff instructing the students, though the majority of the student time will be spent with our partner Roads to  Success. We will have an instructional coordinator that oversees the program and ensures that the Roads to Success  group leaders support the students correctly when working on homework, uphold the sustained silent reading tenets  to heart and work with our children being aware of their social and emotional needs.   The instructional coordinator will also support the communication between the students’ classroom teachers and the  ELT teachers. They will share noticing’s, concerns and triumphs in regards to homework completion, social and  emotional noticing’s and the academic concepts that need to be reinforced within the ELT.      2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       62              Part 4 – ELT Program Implementation and Oversight   Part 4a.

The team will continue to work in partnership with the Roads to Success after school  program to oversee and assess the program. Teacher Leaders has been assigned to support the implementation and  development of the Saturday Academy. Teacher Leaders will work together with the principal to oversee and assess  the Saturday Academy program.    At the start of both the after school programming and the Saturday programming, students will take baseline  assessments. Periodically throughout the program, we will compare the data, derived from performance tasks, math  assessments and running records, from those students that are in our ELT program to those who are not in the  program. We will track attendance and time present in the ELT programs when comparing the data.     Part 4b. Timeline for implementation and completion, including start and end dates.  Our after school programming will start in the beginning of October and will run to the end of June. The after school  program will run from 2:35-5:35. In the math program each group will get a one hour small group intervention  session. These sessions will range from small group instruction, group work, hands on activity tasks, math games,  group and partner discussions and one-on-one support.    In regards to the Saturday programming, it too will begin in the October and run until April of 2019. The time for the  Saturday academy will be from 8:00- 12:30. Students will have breakfast from 8:00- 8:30 and lunch from 12:00-12:30.  Instruction is from 9:00- 12:00. Students will receive 90 minutes of ELA support and 90 minutes of math support.

In our pre-school classes we use monthly newsletters and periodic progress reporting to keep our parents informed  about grade level expectations and students’ progress. We maintain a calendar of workshop topics designed to  supporting our parents in better preparing their children for kindergarten. We hold open houses for our families who  are transitioning into kindergarten. Our open house is an opportunity for parents to meet our kindergarten teachers  and receive next steps in preparation for September. Additionally, we ensure that our pre-k students experience a  smooth transition into kindergarten by offering our TCRWP staff development to our pre-k teachers to ensure literacy  alignment throughout our early childhood program.         4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Teachers work collaboratively on grade level teacher teams to review and design assessments. The teachers also use  their 90 minute common planning time to design and use rubrics in effort to norm grade level expectations. Based on  assessment results, teachers use the inquiry process to explore instructional next steps to address trends noted  throughout the grade        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).   2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       72        Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.   2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       73      Section 10: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)    Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. 07X369, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.    The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program.

(Direct Instruction)* To  establish "The Gift of Reading" initiative in Bilingual and ESL classrooms. Eg. Teachers feature  the book of the day, read the book, or provide students with a brief summary. Book is given to a  student at the end of the day. Goal is to provide students and families with 6 "seed books" to start  a family library in their homes.    *To establish a partnership with the New York Historical Society by inviting a Historical  educator into our classrooms to provide social studies enrichment. Through the program our  students will develop academic language by analyzing and discussing replicas of artifacts, works  of art, maps, and documents to better understand NYC. The goal will be for students to learn to  think critically as historians.  Through the learning opportunities, our students will building their  critical thinking skills, while deepen their content knowledge and ENL skills. Our ENL team will  collaborate with the museum educators to create an inquiry-driven program aligned to CCLS,  NYS Learning Standards for Social Studies, and the NYSESLAT.  (Direct Instruction)     *To engage parents in family literacy workshops.  Eg. "Mommy and Me" and "The Gift of  Reading": how to read with our children, how to establish a family library in the home,  developing an appreciation of books in the home, establishing a "Family Reading Time". Parent  Workshops: NYSESLAT Orientation Workshops: 3 sessions K-1, 2-3, 4-5 (Presented in English  and Spanish).  *To engage parents in authentic learning experiences through field trip to various  NYC cultural institutions.

We also feel the need to  adapt our assessments in our cluster classrooms to better understand the strengths and areas of  need for our ELLs.  We will work toward this growth by organizing intervisitations to peer  schools within our district whom have developed best practices, in their cluster classrooms  especially.  We plan to support our cluster teachers, our ENL teachers and our TBE teachers  during our biweekly one hour meetings to evaluate the needs of students receiving services in  our cluster classrooms, bilingual classrooms and in our standalone ENL program.  We will use  assessment data and anecdotal observations to inform pedagogical direction of our practices  which then will enable us to determine which specific programs we should visit.  Upon further  team reflection during these intervisitations, we will determine our specific next steps in our  cluster classrooms, as well as in our TBE classrooms and ENL program.  Once those needs are  developed we will select specific consultants that will provide us greater support in targeted  areas.   The results of these meetings and intervisitations, both information and the material, will  be shared monthly with all staff who are responsible for ELL instruction during professional  development as a part of our school-wide Marvelous Monday extended sessions.     We will provide our teachers with professional development opportunities conducted as  intervisitations by using Title 3 funds to secure substitutes so teachers can attend.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?    Fundations, Teacher’s College Reading and Writing Program, Concepts of Print Inventory, Fountas and Pinnell Running  Records all of these programs are used to establish baseline scores, to inform and to set instructional goals, and for purposes  of monitoring students' progress.           2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       87      Our school has integrated our data-tracking to an online interactive system, Google Drive, which allows for all of our student’s  scores and academic progress to be available to view for any current or future teachers and administrators. Also, we have  worked with many coaches and consultants who support our ELLs in areas such as strategic vocabulary development, teaching  questioning and discussion techniques, choosing culturally-relevant texts and engaging in meaningful book discussions.        3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?     Evaluation of the program's success is based on multiple measures including baseline assessments, progress monitoring tools,  formative assessments, and standardized testing data.  The number of students at each proficiency level is calculated and  groups are formed for both targeted and strategic instruction.  Each student’s progress is continuously monitored through  work samples, formal and informal assessments that are used to inform our planning and help teachers adjust instruction.                                   4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Our grade level teams meet every Friday for common planning and to examine assessments and other data collected.  We also  have Tuesday bilingual team meetings in which the team reviews, ELL student progress monitoring assessments in light of the  NYSESLAT,  ELL students are continuously grouped and then regrouped within the classroom and those in need of further interventions  are scheduled to receive support from our LLI and Reading Rescue teams. Data is also reviewed and shared during our  Common Planning and Bilingual Team meetings amongst teachers, and students’ goals are adjusted to meet their English  language proficiency needs.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   ELL students who may struggle academically and/or students who do not show progress as per their IEP, academic, or  language goals, are brought up for intervention. The Intervention Team meets once a week to discuss individual ELL students.  Intervention team members, Special Education teacher/coordinator, Speech, OT, ENL teacher, and guidance counselor, work  together to study and analyze student work and test data to put in place appropriate interventions. These are the possible  interventions available for ELL students: Leveled Literacy Intervention (LLI), Reading Rescue, Imagine Learning, and READ, an  afterschool program. For example, a possible intervention would be to include a Reading Rescue teacher assessing reading on  a daily basis and to every month share the assessment data with the Special Education teachers and classroom teachers.         6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   .      PS 369 uses the NYSESLAT, NYSITELL, Spanish Lab, and Common Core ELA and Math exams to evaluate and inform our ELL  programs. ENL and Bilingual teachers use students’ NYSESLAT and NYSITELL proficiency levels for determining groupings for  standalone and integrated ENL instruction. They also use students’ scores in each language domain (listening, reading, writing  and speaking) to determine areas of growth and to set language goals for students.   2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       88         The majority of the school’s Spanish speaking ELLs enroll in our TBE program from K-2nd grade. Upon exiting to a monolingual  classroom, they continue to show incremental growth in English proficiency during the year. The majority of the students in  the 2nd grade bilingual classroom (with exception of newcomer ELLs) scored at the Expanding or Transitioning level on the  2016 NYSESLAT, and 11 of those 16 students tested at least one proficiency level higher than in 2015.           7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The ENL team meets with classroom teachers at the beginning of the year to inform teachers of students’ NYSESLAT or  NYSITELL scores and proficiency levels for students. All the information is also placed on our shared GoogleDrive. After  teachers are aware of their students’ levels, the bilingual and ENL team meet during the week to discuss teaching strategies  share resources and materials and make adjustments to the program where needed. The ENL team also uses the State Math  and ELA exams to inform their teaching during pull out and push in groups.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.    Students in K-2 monolingual classrooms are serviced primarily through Integrated ENL. A licensed ENL teachers  pushes into the classroom and co-teaches using parallel or small group instruction that supports the day's content  objectives with focus on the language development. Pull-out groups are also incorporated depending on student  proficiency levels and individual needs. Grades 3-5 operate on a block schedule, and ELLs are heterogeneously  distributed among each grade level's classrooms. Integrated ENL is provided during the ELA, Social Studies or Math  blocks for each class. Students are grouped homogeneously or heterogeneously within their class depending on the  day's objectives. Stand-Alone ENL is implemented via the pull-out model in groups no larger than 10,  given the  mandates in CR Part 154. Certified ENL teachers collaborate with the student’s homeroom teacher to plan lessons  that supplement the material and support the learner, with the use of several forms of scaffolds. Additional Stand- Alone ENL is implemented as needed for support around particular language/ content objectives; these groups are  heterogeneous with respect to proficiency level and the overall composition is dictated by the skill that is being  taught.            b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Grades K-2 have self-contained bilingual Spanish/ English classrooms. The certified bilingual teacher delivers both  content and ENL (Integrated and Stand-Alone) instruction, in addition to the mandated period(s) of Home Language  Arts (HLA) and bilingual content. These classrooms are heterogeneously populated in terms of proficiency levels.       c.  DL program.  If applicable.               2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?        The administration ensures that students are receiving the mandated instructional minutes by carefully working with teachers   2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       89      in the creation of schedules that reflect the mandated number of minutes for each student at each of the proficiency levels:  entering, emerging, transitioning, expanding, commanding. Our ELL coach, Juan Flores collaborates with the ENL and bilingual  teachers to develop their schedules using the new Part 154 guidelines for the transitional bilingual classes, as well as, the  working with the ENL teachers.  Bilingual teachers provide ENL (integrated and stand-alone), HLA, and bilingual content  instruction that matches their students' language allocation mandates. Units of study at each grade level are aligned and  adapted in Spanish with language proficiency levels as follows using the TC reading and writing project and authentic  children’s literature in English and in Spanish.           3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.    In each of the program models, the core content is delivered based on the minutes mandated under CR Part 154. Students  receive specific instruction either in English or in Spanish based on their proficiency and grade levels.  In our bilingual  classrooms, core content is delivered by the bilingual teacher. As appropriate to the students' proficiency levels, the teachers  transition from instruction that is mostly in Spanish to instruction that is mainly in English. However, the teacher adjusts the  scaffolds and materials depending on the needs of her students. For monolingual classrooms, the classroom teacher is  responsible for content delivery with the support of the ENL teacher during integrated ENL. Both program models use visual  supports, text adaptation and amplification, native language supports, hands-on learning, talk stems, and strategic  homogenous and heterogenous groupings to promote language development while facilitating access to the CCLS.                         4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?    In our bilingual program, ELLs are evaluated with assessments that are in Spanish and English to allow for comparison among  the measures. Teachers use Running Records with English and Spanish texts as informal assessments to progress monitor  students’ development in L1 and L2, sight word inventories, and baseline writing tasks and subsequent writing samples are  used as informal assessments to monitor and to track students' home language proficiency and development throughout the  year.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    .      Instruction is differentiated by content, process, and product. Classroom teachers, Bilingual teachers, and ENL teachers  differentiate instruction by utilizing visuals, realia, charts, graphic organizers etc. Teachers differentiate the content  throughout lessons by providing students with adapted texts, word banks, written color-coded directions, body language etc.  Teachers differentiate the product by allowing students to complete a task that is linguistically appropriate for each ELL  student based on their interest.a.               Teachers of SIFE students use the information from SIFE interviews, as well as, the  data from LENS, the Spanish Lab, and from the NYSITELL and/ or NYSESLAT scores. The school develops and then implements a  specific SIFE curriculum that is aligned to CCLS and CC Bilingual Standards. Each SIFE curriculum is developed with the SIFE’s  academic, as well as,  language needs in mind.b.               Teachers integrate newcomer ELL students into everyday instruction  and activities by grouping these students with more advanced ELLs and allowing newcomer ELLs to respond in their home  language, as well as, through other means of communication: pictures, gestures, drawings etc. Teachers work with newcomer   2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       90      ELLs in small groups, either push-in or pull-out, to teach key vocabulary and skills such as letter sound  recognition.c.               Teachers work with developing ELLs to further assist these students in developing their language and  social skills. Teachers design curriculum that specifically target the language that these students need the most support in.  Developing students have opportunities throughout the day and during each lesson to apply content knowledge through  listening, speaking, reading and writing.d.               Former ELLs are provided the required 90 of ENL instruction in a given week.  In addition, classroom teachers assist former ELLs through the use of the following strategies: peer-mentor roles, extensive  interactive and collaborative writing opportunities, strategic teaching of complex language structures, engaging students by  working on oral language (writing and giving speeches, classroom debates on current events).e.  Testing accommodations for  ELLs and former ELLs (up to two years) are provided as outlined in the ELL accommodations in the School Administrator's  manual and include: Time extension, IEP specifications- separate location, third reading of listening selection, bilingual  dictionaries/and or glossaries.        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?      ENL, TBE, and classroom teachers use a Whole Language Approach, the literacy philosophy that highlights that students focus  on the meaning and strategy of instruction rather than solely on phonics, decoding, and spelling.  Cooperative Learning, in  which students are placed into smaller, level and ability-based groups where students participate in a variety of activities that  support the ELL and Special Needs students’ learning needs.  Teachers use culturally appropriate texts and they design  activities to provide students with meaningful, hands-on and collaborative experiences to acquire English and accelerate its  development. Students have opportunities to engage in cognitively demanding but highly engaging activities that prompt  students to speak, listen, read and write in English.          7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  ENL and bilingual teachers are part of the IEP team and collaborate with service providers to plan and adjust instruction and  goals. They are involved at each step of the process, from initial identification, summative year-end progress checks to  subsequent re-evaluations. Additionally, the ENL team regularly collaborates with the Speech and Language and Occupational  Therapy teams and with our special education coach to share and learn information about students’ individual needs and seek  advice about integrating special education supports with ENL instruction. ENL teachers are aware of and responsible for  student IEP goal progress and, whenever possible, work alongside ICT special educators to develop lesson plans and scaffolds,  as well as, determine the language(s) of instruction, that support this development.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  In ELA, K to 2 students who are at the entering and emerging levels are supported with Leveled Literacy Intervention (LLI),  guided reading, and Reading Rescue during the school day by their classroom teachers and by the ENL teachers. In the area of  math, all students are provided with native language supports, guided native language instruction for students that are  entering and emerging by their classroom teachers. All students are provided specific supports that align to students’  individual language needs and a program of specific skills is planned and taught by their classroom teachers and by the ENL  teachers.   After school, ELL students are involved in English enrichment activities that provide storytelling, theatre, art and  music activities. During vacation camps (during winter and spring break) ELL students are invited to a series of field trips that  build background knowledge of New York City history, highlight and appreciate different cultures and allows them the  opportunity to explore new communities through museum visits. Title III funding is used to support transitioning and  expanding students in ELA, Math, and NYSESLAT preparation.  These same students are also taken on field trips to provide  enrichment opportunities for writing and for supporting their understanding in math. Students are also provided with Saturday   2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       91      Academy enrichment opportunities in both ENL and content areas. The school uses iReady, Imagine Learning, and MyOn  software to provide developmentally appropriate language and content support in math, ESL, and ELA.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?     Given our student population, we are assessing the feasibility of additional bilingual classes in grades 3-5 to meet the  demonstrated student needs and parent program selection. Our ENL team will also increase their collaborative work with  classroom teachers to model for them supporting  newcomer ELLs in the classroom, providing specific reading and writing  strategies for ELLs at various levels and providing progress-monitoring strategies through a variety of PDs and inter-visitations.  We also plan to continue offering the programs and services that are currently available to our students.  We want to reserve  the last Tuesday of every month to  provide parents with a list of resources that they can use to assist their children with  homework as well as with their language development.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   We plan to continue offering the programs and services that are currently available to our students.         11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.    Our school has partnered with our afterschool CBO partner to provide after school programming that includes academic  support along with arts and sports opportunities. From January to May (before the start of the NYSESLAT) the school also  offers Title III Afterschool Programming, taught by the two ENL teachers, for English Language Learners in 2nd through 5th  grade. Transitioning and expanding students in 2nd- 5th grade receive support in listening, speaking, reading and writing to  reinforce skills they will use on the NYSESLAT. Additionally, we offer a Saturday Academy program from October through April  for grades K-5-- kindergarteners and first graders receive ENL instruction and second through fifth graders reinforce the  content that they have practiced in school and prepare for state exams. Saturday academy, Title III and after school programs  serve to provide additional supports to the instruction that occurs during the day and in terms of preparing students for the  NYSESLAT.            12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Technology, such as SmartBoards and document cameras  allow us to provide more extensive and internet based language  support for our ELL students.  All classrooms have access to iPads and laptops for projects, research, and individualized content  reinforcement. Teachers use SmartBoards to supplement their instruction with pictures, videos, and other visual  reinforcement. Students have the opportunity to use ImagineLearning software and iReady online programming as an  additional source of English literacy and math support.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?    ENL: Teachers use translated texts, bilingual glossaries and materials such as worksheets  provide HLA with ENL supports. They  also give students the opportunity to respond in their home language as needed. When working in small groups with an ENL  teacher, students are also provided with trans-language opportunities, which allow them to use their native language in  conjunction with the language of instruction.    TBE: Teachers  assess newcomer students’  home language reading ability with running records in Spanish. If students have  Spanish writing or reading ability they can continue in home language while receiving instruction from the teacher in both  English and Spanish. Students use a bilingual word wall, bilingual glossaries, and read Spanish texts.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.          2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       92         Students in the bilingual program are placed according to their appropriate age groups upon entrance to the program in Pre-K  to 2nd  grade according to the HLIS and parent choice forms (given when students are first enrolled in the school.)  Program  schedules are designed taking into account the Part 154 mandated minutes of services as per language proficiency levels of the  students in the class.   ELLs who are not in the bilingual program receive ENL support services, push in or pull out, in  accordance with the mandated number of minutes as per Part 154 regulations.        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?      Currently our school does not collaborate with the other school’s ENL team, but going forward we would like to make that  one of our goals for next school year.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).      Newly enrolled ELLs in both TBE and ENL programs, regardless of their arrival date, are provided with orientation activities  and assessments. The ENL team, Ms. Keller and Ms. Howard ensure that all newcomers are evaluated to determine their prior  knowledge, education experiences, and language abilities. This is accomplished through assessments that have been  developed inhouse and through the initial ELL identification process. The NYSITELL, Spanish LAB (if applicable) are  administered to new students upon enrollment to the school.  The parent coordinator, Ms. Aponte and the ELL Coach, Mr.  Flores conduct ELL Parent Orientation workshops at the beginning of the school year. During these workshops the parents of  new ELLs are provided with information regarding the programs available to support new ELLs, including the program goals,  program selection options, and are shown the required video.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    n/a        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   n/a        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Given the newest revisions and amendments to Part 154, bilingual and ENL teachers spend 50% of their PD hours on ELL  related PDs. Monolingual classroom teachers spend 15% of their PD hours on ELL related PDs. ENL teachers keep and update a  list of all ELL PDs available and offered by the ELL office at the NYC DOE. This list is then shared with bilingual and classroom  teachers every week so these teachers can decide which ELL PD they wish to attend based on their ELL population and ELL  needs. Moreover, once a month during Monday PDs, ENL teachers provide different PD opportunities that cover a range of ELL  issues. We have hired an ELL coach, Mr. Flores to support the TBE and ENL teachers and to provide professional development  for the entire staff, guidance counselors, special education teachers, psychologists, OT/PT, speech therapists, including  secretaries, and the parent coordinator, Ms. Aponte, on second language acquisition and ELL support strategies.  In addition,  these staff members are included in PD on "Restorative Practices for Positive classroom management" that includes the goal of  the establishment of procedures and expectations for student behavior that encourage the development of positive  interpersonal skills in both students and in staff.  Our ELL coach, Mr. Flores provides our TBE and ENL teachers with   2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       93         professional development that includes the alignment of second language acquisition stages and CCLS.  Teachers of ELLs are  invited to ELL-specific Teachers College calendar days to continue learning and growing professionally as a pedagogue in a  Reading and Writing Project school. These PDs emphasize strategies to provide effective scaffolding and differentiation in  order to create multiple entry points to grade-level TCRWP content for ELLs. Additionally, ENL and bilingual teachers are  encouraged to pursue opportunities through the Office of English Language Learners and our R-BERNs at Fordham and NYU.  After attending these PDs, ENL/bilingual staff turnkey materials and information both in person and via a shared Google Drive  folder to ensure that their new knowledge is shared throughout the department and supports vertical and horizontal  alignment and planning.      (answer included in question 1 response)        2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.      Our guidance counselor, Stephanie Nuñez, distributes information on dual language middle school programs to our  5th       grade classroom teachers so that students are aware of the many language-learning options available to them.  Students and parents also receive all information in English and in their home language and are provided with in-school and  extracurricular support throughout the application and selection process. When ELLs attend interviews, they are given practice  opportunities, previews of the kinds of questions and tasks with which they may be presented, and guidance around portfolio  development and appropriate behavior and appearance for school visits. Our F status ELL Coach, Mr. Flores, in collaboration  with our ENL teachers will provide TBE/ENL teachers with professional development on Mondays and/or Tuesdays in order to  meet the 50% of total PD on ELL instructional strategies.  All agendas are kept in the ESL room in a compliance  binderBilingual/ENL teachers have the opportunity to participate in Teachers College study groups that focus on instructional  strategies and curricular scaffolding and differentiation for ELLs. These teams also meet on a monthly basis to discuss student  data and progress toward the next level of proficiency. Professional learning community meetings occur weekly and focus on  case studies, noticings from inter-visitations, and challenges that a teacher may have encountered in the classroom with  respect to targeted language development.              Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Each September- October ELL parents are invited to a ELL program orientation workshop where they learn information about  changes and/or amendments to CR Part 154,  TBE and ENL programs, as well as, TBE program schedules. Teachers discuss the  goals of the program and ENL/integrated ENL/HLA minute allocation. At this meeting ELL parents get ELL language  development reports for their children. Such reports reflect the previous year’s NYSESLAT data. TBE and ENL teachers discuss  with parents each of the language skills (listening, speaking, reading and writing) and provide feedback about the student’s  strengths and weaknesses, as well as, next steps they can apply during the school year both at home and in the classroom.      Interpretation services are provided for parents whose language is other than English whenever needed.   TBE and ENL  teachers schedule meetings with ELL parents every Tuesday during Parent Engagement time to discuss their child’s English  language development across content areas and their students' academic and linguistic progress. Challenges around  homework issues are also addressed, as well as, students' linguistic development in both Spanish and English and both short  term and long term goals are discussed with parents.  Teachers document all the meetings with sign-in sheets and/or logs in which they outline the purpose of the meeting, and the  outcome of the meeting.    All the records pertaining to parent outreach are stored in the compliance binder that includes  letters, phone call logs, emails, and in-person documentation (sign-in sheet). Qualified translators provides translation services  when needed: parent letters and/or communication with the parents in person during school-based events (parent-teacher  2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       94            conferences, individual meetings with the teacher etc.). In September ELL parents are invited for ELL parent orientation. At this  time parents learn of different ELL programs available to their children by viewing a short video that is available in their home  language. At this time, or within 10 school days, parents have a choice of choosing an ELL program for their children. These are  the programs that exist at the school: TBE and stand alone ENL. Once parents return their program selection forms, the initial  parent choice is recorded in the ELL Parent Choice Update screen (ELPC) in ATS. After the initial parent choice is documented in  ELPC, parents may change their choice at any time by writing to the principal or designee. All subsequent changes to parent  choice, after capture of initial parent choice, can be made on the BNDC screen. The Parent Survey and Program Selection Form  are completed and then placed in the student’s cumulative folder (along with any subsequent written consent to change ELL  program choice).      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   ELL parents are involved with PS369 in a variety of settings. In the 14-15 school year, the ENL team developed and ran a  "Mommy and Me" ESL program for the parents of our Pre-K and K students wherein parents/families were invited for  introductory ESL classes alongside their enrolled children during the parent engagement period each Tuesday. The parents of  ELLs are also invited to volunteer in our classrooms to support programming like Cookshop and curriculum-based events like  publishing parties. Our school leadership team also involves several parents of ELLs. Our parent coordinator, Ms. Aponte is  bilingual and regularly has events that involve and engage the parents of ELLs throughout the year. This year she has sign up  our school in the partnership with Lincoln Center, Partnering with Family Links. Families can attend performances at Lincoln  Center at a fraction of the cost.  Every meeting is translated and our ELL families are participating in our Title 1 and on our  SLT.         Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Jaleelah Cooke, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       96                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Young Leaders Elementary                                                                              School DBN: 07X369  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Parent language is determined through the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) and the parent survey  distributed at parent orientations. We also track the information that is provided on Emergency Contact cards.  The information from these sources is cross-checked with the language preference in ATS to ensure that the  parents are receiving school information in the language they best understand and prefer. This information is  then put in a spreadsheet and shared with each classroom teacher so that they are able to ensure that all parent  communication is accessible to families. When new families arrive in the school, we ensure that the teachers'  information sheets are updated with the necessary information. We have begun making efforts to check in and  informally interview our parents in the community who list Spanish as their preferred language because, after  several conversations, we learned that the low incidence language Mixteco is prevalent in this area and many  parents (and children) actually speak it at home almost exclusively and do not have strong Spanish proficiency.  Although we do not have parents who specifically opted to have information sent home in Mixteco (this would be  challenging, given that the written variety has only been developed recently), an awareness of their langauge   2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       98      background helps us communicate with them more effectively in Spanish and provide appropriate supports for  their child's language development. The parents' preferred languages for communication are Spanish, Sarahule,  Malinke, Arabic, Dutch, Mixteco. Our parent coordinator is a key component in this assessment of language  preference as she consistently communicates with families both in person, through phone blasts and through  written communication this is backpacked home with the students. She helps hold everyone accountable in  ensuring that teachers are communicating with families with the greatest impact.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     Written Preferred    Percent Written          Oral Preferred    Percent Oral          Language    Spanish, Sarahule,  Malinke, Arabic, Dutch,  Mixteco            3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.            Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services    1.

Meeting Name    Month/Frequency of Meetings    How does your school plan to      provide interpretation service(s)?       Parents are invited to curriculum  night that is held annually the first  week of October. During this time  parents get to interact with the  classroom teachers and related  service providers. At all times, when  available, staff fluent in the parent’s  language is assigned to assist  classroom teachers and related  service providers. Parents also are  invited to parent-teacher conferences  that happen three times throughout  the year. PTAs are held two, three  times every few months. At each such  event, parents are offered translation  and interpretation services from  bilingual staff and/or a certificated  and qualified interpreter. Parents are  kept informed about these and other  school-based events through phone  calls home made by a bilingual parent  coordinator.            3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.               Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure    Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.               2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       100       Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      Language ID Guide is conveniently located behind the security desk so it is visible by parents as they walk into the  school. Each teacher is provided with the TIU card that is readily available. A welcome poster and parents’ bill of rights  are displayed in the main office so both documents are visible by parents as they walk into the office. Office staff is  trained to direct parents to carefully read the documents so the school staff is aware of how they can assist the  parents.    School staff is responsible for providing each parent whose primary language is other than English language and who  require language assistance services with a copy of the Bill of Parent Rights and Responsibilities which includes their  rights regarding translation and interpretation services.    School staff will post in a conspicuous location at or near the primary entrance to such school a sign in each of the  covered languages, or most prominent covered languages, indicating the availability of interpretation services.    Each school’s safety plan will contain procedures for ensuring that parents in need of language access services are not  prevented from reaching the school’s administrative offices solely due to language barriers. We have many  opportunities to share information with families. Through our monthly Parent meetings with our prinicpal, entitled  "Coffee with Cooke", through PA meetings, and SLT meetings. At these various events, we provide a copy of the the A- 663 regulations for our families. Additionally, we have added a link to this resource on our school website. Our school  website is easily accessible in Spanish and is another way we communiate with families about their rights, roles and  responsibilities.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       The parent coordinator (Aiowa Aponte) will collaborate with the ENL team to periodically assess parents' response to  materials that are distributed and experiences at in-person meetings. When it becomes apparent that a teacher is  faced with a communication challenge (e.g. few, if any parent notices returned or parent seems unaware of  information that is shared), s/he has the responsibility to reach out to the parent coordinator and ENL team for  assistance in facilitating the parent's language access in a more effective manner. At the mid point and end of the  year, a parent survey is distributed so that the school can assess the extent to which parents feel that their needs are  being met and make adjustments accordingly. In addition to our parent coordinator, our SLT members will work with  our PA to distribute and collect feedback forms that will help us monitor the quality and availbilty of services. We will  also keep these feedback forms on hand for all parent/family events such as Parent Teacher Conferences, Family  Literacy Night, and Hot Cocoa night as those gatherings are often very well-attended and will allow us a greater  opportunity to reach more of our families.         2018-19 SCEP-SIG                                                                                                                                                                                                       101
