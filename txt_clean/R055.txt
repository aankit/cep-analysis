This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Our Mission at P.S. 55 is to create an exciting world of learning, where every student can learn and achieve. As a  learning community, we all have high expectations for every student, and we will work collaboratively to modify and  adjust instruction and performance tasks so all students have equal access to the learning and can succeed.  Instruction and tasks are rigorous, teaching students how to think for themselves, organize information and create  mental models, integrate individual skills into whole sets of processes, and apply what they learn into new situations.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9                  2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   P.S. 55 has approximately 650 students, grades pre K-5. We offer classroom settings in general education, integrated  co-teaching, and self contained special education classes. Student attendance is 94%, with approximately 13%  chronically absent. Our student demographics are: 3% Asian, 1% Black, 9% Hispanic, and 85% White. 30% of our  students are eligeable for free/reduced lunch. We are located in Eltingville, a small community located on the south  shore of Staten Island.       One of our greatest achievements in creating an exciting world of learning is our Buddy Program. Each year our 5 th  grade students are paired up with a “buddy” kindergarten student. The 5th grader writes their new buddy a letter  welcoming them to the school. A "Meet and Greet" is organized during the summer where they meet for the first  time, play games together and get to know each other. There are activities planned throughout the year to help foster  this “big brother” type relationship. The philosophy behind this program is to make the transition easier for our new  students, while instilling a sense of responsibility in our 5th graders. All benefit from this program.   This is just one initiative that creates an environment where students are excited to come to school.       Another program is our partnership with Dancing Classrooms, where our 5th grade students spend ten weeks learning  five different ballroom dances. The students learn about the origin of the dances and their history, as well as  participate in a city-wide competition. We have partnered with the local YMCA to teach swimming and water safety  to each of our second grade students. Our third grade students enjoy a ten week African Dance enrichment program,  led by Sundog Theatre. Our school newspaper is written by our fourth and fifth grade students, in partnership with  Sundog Theatre. Our student council has the responsibility of carrying out our sustainability initiatives including  recycling. They run our school store, which helps raise funds to support programs and provide materials our students  need. Additionally, we have a talent show so students can let their skills and talents shine. We host a career day that  brings in parents and community residents, demonstrating a wide variety of occupations, allowing our students to  make connections between learning, college and career readiness, and their roles as lifelong learners. Other exciting  programs include; physical education, performing arts classes (musical performance by students in grades 4 and 5),  music appreciation (grades K and 1), recorders (grade 2), chorus (grade 3), violins (grade 3, 4 and 5), band (grade 4  and 5), visual arts classes, coding classes , technology club for students in grade 5, after school enrichment programs,  Saturday Academy for “test prep”, and monthly School Spirit days.   When it comes to scheduling, we have created a block of time that allows all teachers to work with targeted groups of  students for academic intervention, guided reading, or enrichment. Because this is not a prep period, all teaching staff  is available to target individual students.    Our Professional Learning time on Monday is differentiated based upon the needs of the staff and is led by teacher  leaders, as well as school leaders. One particular structure that we have in place during Professional Learning is  ensuring time for both vertical, as well as horizontal team collaboration during Inquiry Mondays. This ensures key  learning and best practices are shared among all teachers/grades. In addition to Inquiry Mondays, we have  Instructional Focus Mondays, Best Practices Monday, and Tech Mondays. Most of these professional learning  opportunities are lead by our teacher leaders.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      As part of our commitment to strong family and community ties, we offer parents opportunities to attend a variety of  workshops conducted by teachers during the family engagement time on Tuesday afternoons, as well as evenings and  Saturdays. Some of the workshops planned include, “The Writing Process”, “How to Work with Your Child at Home”,  “Math Strategies”, “Subtraction Strategies”, “Using ‘Show Me’ to Assist My Child”, “Testing, and How to Support and  Prepare Your Child for the State Tests”. Additional workshops are planned throughout the year as needs and requests  arise. Monthly family events are planned, encouraging all families to participate. Some of these family events include:  P.S. 55 Annual 5K run, Thanksgiving Dinner, STEM Night, Staff/Student/Parent Basketball game to support March Of  Dimes, Serving Up Technology Volleyball event to support 5th grade technology needs.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   We have approximately 140 students with special needs , (22%) students with IEPs. 22 students, (3%) are in our self  contained 12:1:1 settings. 71 students, (11%) are in our ICT classrooms. 512 students, (78%) are in our general  education classrooms. 97 students receive speech services, 49 students receive occupational therapy services, 23  students receive physical therapy services, and 30 receive mandated counseling. We have 31 students, (5%) that are  in our ELL program, with home languages of Arabic, Cantonese, Korean, Mandarin, Russian, and Spanish. 2 students  are entering, 2 students are emerging, 7 students are transitioning, 10 students are expanding, and 10 students are  commanding.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   We made the most progress in collaborative teachers, effective school leadership, and trust.

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     Based on the New York State Common Core 2018 English Language Arts scores (Grades 3, 4, 5) 26%% of students with  disabilities met proficiency (performing at level 3 or 4), while 67%% of general education students scored at or above  grade level. Further data analysis revealed that 78% of our Students with Disabilities are boys and 22% are girls. The  data revealed there is a significant gap between gender performances.      On our Quality Review (QR) 2015 – 2016 we received a proficient for QR indicator 1.1, 1.2, and 2.2. The report stated  our area of focus is 2.2, aligning assessment to curricula, use on-going assessment and grading, practices, and analyze  information on student learning outcomes to adjust instructional decisions at the team and classroom levels.      Informed by Capacity Framework Element – Rigorous Instruction, current data and our most recent QR, there is a  need to refine the use of strategies that provide scaffolds and multiple entry points, especially for students with  disabilities. This needs assessment informed the development of the annual goal listed below.

Additional staff members attend Therapeutic Crisis  Intervention for Schools (TCIS) and receive certification of  completion.   Team of teacher leaders will provide professional learning for  Social Emotional Learning program, Sanford Harmony to  ensure 100% execution of unit 1 in September 2018.   Professional learning will be provided for all new staff on key  components of TCIS with a specific focus on conducting Life  Space Interviews and emotional first aid to give the students  opportunities to discuss alternate methods of handling a  situation and an avenue to practice that in a comfortable  interaction with a trusting and supportive adult.   School leaders will serve as a model when interacting with  students in crisis serving as a learning opportunity for all staff  involved with their particular students in crisis.   To meet the social emotional needs of our students, support  personnel will have lunch groups for students that find the  cafeteria over stimulating. During this time students will be  taught coping skills to help them maintain their baseline  behavior.   Teachers will be given an opportunity to identify students  who they feel need TCIS supports. An Individual Crisis  Management Plan Template will be completed for each of  these students. Once the student is identified and the plan is  completed, a TCIS Mentor will be assigned to that teacher  and student for continued support.   a) A series workshops will be offered to parents informing  and training them on the important strategies being used  from TCIS ( Life Space Interview, Emotional First Aid, Power  Struggle) that they can use at home to establish continuity  between school and home. b) In addition, a town hall   10/18-5/19  Borough Support   Liason.

This team, in partnership with our School Based Support  Team (SBST) and special education liason, will help  families of IEP students understand the IEP process,  special education services and their rights from the  perspective of a parent. This will empower parents with  the knowledge to help ensure that every student is on a  “Shared Path to Success”. This team will have monthly  "breakfast" meetings with parents to allow for an  exchange of important information and sharing of fears  and concerns.     A workshop will be provided for families of IEP students   about “A Shared Path to Success”. Parents will walk  through the document so they have a greater insight of  how “A Shared Path to Success” helps to create an  inclusive school for their children.     All school and classroom events will be communicated   to families on our school calendar, on the school  website, through a class notice or newsletter and  through our School Messenger System, at least 1 month  before an event.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Column B   Verify with an (X)   Section Reference(s)   Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local                                                  1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 055, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.           Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   P.S. 055 will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for staff to improve outreach, communication skills and cultural  competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other members of the school community;         The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed to:   Parental Involvement and School Quality   provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State accountability  system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning  Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the ESSA;   (cli      In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  P.S. 55 uses assessments such as the Fountas and Pinnell to assess early literacy skills of our ELLs.  This data provides insight  into ELLs reading, speaking, listening and writing levels.  This data helps inform our school’s instructional plan by determining if  the students are on grade level or if they need response to intervention (RTI) to reach grade level.  If a student is below grade  level they will participate in small groups with skill based lessons until they master the skills needed to reach grade level.        2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Formative assessments are administered by the classroom teacher.  The results of these assessments are shared with the ENL  teacher during co-planning time.  During this time, teachers collaborate and decide which skills they need to focus and which  types of scaffolds need to be in place.  Running records are completed three times a year, RTI team for observation and assessment, special education teachers  supporting pull out small group instruction during designated blocks of time for thirty minutes five times a week.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48         3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Success of programs for ELLs is evaluated by formal and informal assessments. Writing pieces and reading levels are used to  informally assess student growth.  The NYSESLAT exam is our summative assessment.  The NYSESLAT modality breakdown is  used to determine the needs of our ELLs and also to determine whether or not changes need to made to our ENL program.   It  provides us with a baseline and also allows us to track student progress from year to year.  In addition, administration of  the NYSITELL helps us to determine the baseline of our newcomers.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once summative assessment data has been gathered, we can determine which students are not making appropriate  progress.  Those students will be offered intervention services.  They will receive these services during our designated  RTI time.  Students will receive small group instruction with a focus on each child's particular area of need.  If further  intervention is needed, students will be pulled for AIS services.       5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]    At P.S.55 our team and school leaders meet to share date on all students that are receiving Response to Intervention (RTI) for  grades K-5. Response to Intervention integrates assessment and intervention within a multi ‐ level prevention system to  maximize student achievement and reduce behavior problems. Teachers monitor student progress and discuss strategies with  staff members during grade level meetings as well as Instructional Team meetings.  Currently the school uses the RTI  contained in ReadyGen curriculum in grades K-5.  ReadyGen has an RTI identification component built into the  assessments.  These assessments determine grouping.  The groups are formed based on which students did not master the  lesson and which students mastered the lesson.  RTI strategies are used to provide the building blocks needed to master the  lesson, as well as, enrichment to the students who have mastered the lesson.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The patterns across the NYSITELL and NYSESlAT reveal that students perform strongest in the listening and speaking portions  of the exam than in the reading and writing parts.  The ENL teacher uses the results of these exams to prepare lesson plans  that address these areas and to improve instruction.  In addition, the ENL teacher  shares this information with the classroom  teachers so they too will know the language needs of their students.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   ENL teachers use the ELL Data Analysis Tool to create a document that clearly displays the strengths and weaknesses of the  ENL students.  This data includes results from NYSESLAT, ELA, and Math State Exams.  The NYSESLAT data is broken down by  modality (reading, writing, listening, and speaking).  ENL teachers meet to discuss areas of need based on this data.   This  information is shared with classroom teachers during co-planning time.  It is at this point that adjustments can be made to our  program.  Based on data gathered using the ELL Data Analysis Tool, we can clearly see that writing is an area of need for most  of the ENL students.  This will be an area of focus in our program this year.  ENL teachers have coordinated their schedules  with the schedules of the classrooms that they service to ensure that time is dedicated to writing.            Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49         regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   ENL services are provided as a combination of integrated and stand-alone instruction based on ENL level (entering,  emerging, transitioning, expanding, and commanding. We follow the CR-154-2 study and staffing  requirements.  Integrated instruction allows the ENL teacher to collaborate with the classroom teacher using ENL  methodologies in teaching to meet the needs of the ELL students. Stand-alone instruction allows the ENL teacher to  focus on specific skills the student needs in a small group setting. During both integrated and stand-alone students are  grouped heterogeneously.   As discussed above, integrated and stand-alone services are provided by a certified English as a New Language  teacher.  This teacher is a certified trained teacher who provides instruction in English using ENL methodologies and  scaffolding. In order to maximize English acquisition for the ELL’s, the ENL teacher and classroom teacher coordinate  their efforts during ELA blocks as often as possible.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              P.S. 55 has an English as a New Language (ENL) program.  All staff, including administration, classroom teachers, and  service providers are aware of their ELL’s NYSESLAT and or NYSITELL scores that determine their proficiency level.  All ENL  students that are at an commanding level receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL service per week for two years after passing  the NYSESLAT exam.  Expanding students receive 180 integrated minutes per week. Transitioning students receive 180 minutes  of integrated or stand-alone service depending on their need. Emergent students receive 360 minutes per week, 90 minutes of  stand-alone service, 180 minutes of integrated and 90 flexible minutes.  Entering ELLs receive 360 minutes per week, 180 as  integrated and 180 as stand alone. Administrators have a copy of the ENL teachers' schedules ensuring that the students are  being serviced properly as per Chancellors Regulations Part 154-2.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      Content area is delivered in English during both integrated and stand-alone sessions and is aligned to the Common  Core.  ELLs are given bilingual glossaries to support the learning of new vocabulary.  Content areas such as social studies and  science are incorporated into literacy, mathematics, technology, and art whenever possible.  Teachers often collaborate to  teach units to develop a cohesive learning environment for students and increase their depth of knowledge.  The ENL teacher  reinforces content with the students through the use of visual aids, vocabulary, manipulatives, and additional materials as  needed.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      ELLs are usually evaluated in English; however, ELLs are evaluated in their Native Language for the New York State Math  assessment if they choose to do so.  In addition, Spanish speaking ELLs are evaluated using the Spanish Lab if they score below  the English Lab cut score.        5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.   Long Term   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      e.   Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status     Differentiating instruction for ELL subgroups is vital in their learning.    a. SIFE students are closely assessed to identify where the gaps in there learning are.  SIFE students are taught the CCLS  according to their grade and English proficiency.  Lessons are modified for them as needed. SIFE students will benefit from  Rosponse to Intervention (RTI) Model.   b. New comers that have been in a U.S. school less than three years are taught the CCLS and it is modified to their English  proficiency.  Oral language, phonics, and vocabulary are strongly enforced for new comers and reinforced in the  classrooms.  ENL teachers and classroom teachers meet during co-planning time to discuss the language needs of these  students so they are aware of what scaffolds should be in place when the ENL teacher is not there.  c. ELLs receiving service for 4-6 years need to be monitored closely and may be candidates for additional support such as the  Response to intervention (RTI) model.  They should be assessed often to identify areas of growth and areas to be  improved.  Lessons aligned to the CCLS build from the information they have not mastered.  d. Long-term ELLs need to be monitored closely and may be candidates for additional support such as the Response to  intervention (RTI) model.  These students may be bilingually evaluated to determine if language or a disability is impeding their  ability to reach English proficiency.  If the student has an IEP, the differentiation is based on the student’s goals. The student  should be assessed often and lessons should build from the information they have not mastered that is aligned to the CCLS  within their IEP goals.  Lessons also scaffold to support students and maintain their language strategies for reading, writing,  listening, and speaking.  The lessons are modified for the student to better understand grade level and complex texts.  e. Former ELLs still receive ENL test modifications as well as additional ENL support of 90 minutes a week of integrated service  for two years after passing the NYSESLAT.  They are also monitored closely by their classroom teacher, the ENL teacher is  always available to offer extra support to former ELLs when needed and can offer the classroom teacher strategies to assist  these former ELLs in learning.  Former ELLs are often placed in a classroom with current ELLs, so the ENL teacher is easily  accessible to them within the integrated model.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   All teachers at PS 55 adapt lessons to meet the needs of ELL- SWDs.  P.S. 55 is now using the core currliculum materials  provided by the DOE.  ReadyGen and GoMath are programs that allow teahers to use multiple entry points for all students  including ELLs and SWDs.  Teachers also use supplementary materials and additional resources such as Orton Gillingham,  Fundations, Mondo and Words Their Way.  All staff, teachers and paraprofessionals engage in professional development and  Professional Learning Communities to improve delivery of instruction to all students.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?   ELL students receiving special education services before the age of five have a turning five meeting before kindergarten to  determine placement and services from that point on.  Through an evaluation process it will determined what services they  will receive or continue for the following school year.  Students already in self-contained programs and ICT will have their  annual IEP meeting to determine if self-contained or the ICT setting is still appropriate.  Regardless of the students ELL level, if  the IEP determines that a self-contained or ICT classroom is the appropriate setting, that's where they are placed. In both  settings, various instructional materials are used to support ELL-SWDs.  ELL-SWDs are exposed to materials such as visual aids,  glossaries, grade level books. The newer programs, ReadyGen and Gomath have an ELL component built in for ELLs.  Furthermore technology is used through Smart boards, iPads and computers with interactive lessons for literacy, math, science  and social studies.  P.S. 55 is committed to flexible programming where students' needs are met. They are provided with  integrated services so they may maintain instructional rigor and are provided with low-risk environments for all students to  work toward their goals.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Our targeted intervention program continues to follow an RTI model.  GoMath and ReadyGen have tier one, two, and three  student intervention books to use with the students that did not master the skill in the lesson.  Students are frequently   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51      assessed before, during and after lessons/units to monitor student progress.  Some students attend SETSS for intervention in  ELA and Math in a small group to master the skills they need.  We also offer Academic Intervention Services (AIS) in ELA and  Math, which allows students to work in a small group to help reinforce and master the skills that they  need.   Student programs are taught in English and are adjusted as needed to accommodate their learning needs.  Bilingual  glossaries are provided as needed.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?       P.S. 55 has been sending teachers to training for Ortan Gillingham.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are part of our school community and have equal access to any and all curriculum, programs and services that are offered  at P.S. 55.   Our various after School programs are offered to all ELLs.   During school programs include the P.S. 55 Band and  Chorus, Tech Team, Kindergarten/Fifth grade Buddy Program and Ballroom Dancing.  P.S. 55 houses an after school program  sponsored by United Activities Unlimited (UAU).  In addition to the after school program P.S. 55 offers  several after-school  enrichment academy programs such as, Drama Club, All Sports, Cooking, Yoga, Zumba and Board Games.  All of our programs  are in place to develop a well-rounded learner and provided multisensory learning. Programs begin at different times  throughout the school year and teachers let their students know how they can get involved.  All students are granted an equal  opportunity to participate. At parent orientation the ENL teachers discuss the different programs offered at the school and  how their children can go about getting involved in the various activities.  A list of the programs (Native and English) is  provided to the parents upon request.        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Various instructional materials are used to support ELLs.  ELLs are exposed to materials such as visual aids, glossaries, books  aligned to their level.  ReadyGen and GoMath have a component built in for ELLs.  Technology is used through Smart boards  with computer based interactive lessons for literacy, math, science and social studies.  In addition smart boards, computers  and Ipads are also used.       13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Currently at P.S. 55 we have an ENL program. Native language support is delivered in our ENL program by the use of content  area glossaries and bilingual dictionaries.         14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.   All service providers and classroom teachers collaborate to best support all ELLs.  Often classroom teachers and service  providers will share materials to reinforce a lesson through different points of entry. All teachers of ELLs are  aware of the age,  grade level, and language proficiency, so they can best assist students in reaching language proficiency and IEP goals. Students  are grouped according to grade level.  No more than two grade levels are grouped together. ELL students with IEPs can be  grouped together regardless of grade level.   Every ENL teacher receives a copy of the grade appropriate curriculum maps for the grades that they service.  This enables the  ENL teacher to work collaboratively with the classroom teacher.  The goal is to allow the ELL students access to age/grade level  content.  Modifications to lessons and additional resources are provided by the ENL teacher as needed.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Various instructional materials are used to support ELLs.  ELLs are exposed to materials such as visual aids, glossaries, books  aligned to their level.  ReadyGen and GoMath have a component built in for ELLs.  Technology is used through Smart boards  with computer based interactive lessons for literacy, math, science and social studies.  In addition smart boards, computers  and Ipads are also used.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52         16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   P.S. 55 offers a buddy program which pairs incoming kindergarten students with fifth grade students.  A welcome buddy day  takes place in August. Parents are sent an invitation in the mail telling them about the event.  There are various activities that  take place throughout the school year that are offered to all students including ELLs. The ENL teacher as well as the classroom  teachers will send home letters (Native language and English) and discuss with the students how they can participate in the  activities.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    No language electives are offered at this time.       18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?    N/A - P.S. 55 does not have a dual language program; but if we get 15 students with the same language  in the same class we will adhere to the mandates and protocols.          Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The ENL teacher attends the Division of School Support and Instruction professional development meetings provided by the  district and meetings by the office of English Language Learners when applicable.  The ENL teacher and the Assistant Principal  attend professional development meetings and turn-key the information to classroom teachers.  The classroom teachers will  continue to attend all mandated ENL professional development hours as needed. The ENL teacher turn-keys PD's to ensure all  staff PD's are 15% based on ELLs. PD is provided on Mondays after school.  These PD's are given to teachers, paraprofessionals  and support staff (guidance counsler, speech and occupational therapists, school secretaries, and parent coordinators).     Teachers are informed when professional development is available for teachers of ELLs.  They are invited to attend  professional development regarding the new Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS) as applicable.  The teachers are all  invited  to attend continuing PD on GoMath and ReadyGen and familiarize themselves with the RTI model and ELL component  within these programs.  Our ENL teacher will also assist in developing best practices for teachers of students with ELLs. The ENL  teacher turn-keys ELL strategies to the staff to ensure they meet the required 15% of PD on ELLs.         2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  All teachers are aware of the 15% of ENL training required. PD opportunities are made available to staff as they become  available.  PD must be dedicated to language acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and  integrating language and content instruction for ELLs.  Certificates of attendance and completion in workshop hours are copied  and maintained in teacher records.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         ENL teachers are aware that 50% of their PD requirements must be ELL specific.  In order to meet this requirement, ENL  teachers attend Professional Development meetings at the Field Support Office.  These meetings are dedicated to language  acquisition, co-teaching strategies, and integrating language into content instructionfor ELLs.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   P.S. 55 provides a lot of opportunities for parents, including parents of ELLs to meet with their childs' teacher to discuss the  goals of the program, language development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development  needs in all content areas.  In addition to mandated parent orientation meetings, parents are able to meet with their childs'  teacher various times throughout the school year to discuss their progress.  On Tuesdays after school P.S. 55 has Parent  Engagement.  During this time ELL parents can come up to school and meet with their childs' teacher to discuss the goals of  the program.  Interpretation and translation are available during this time to parents as needed.   If ELL parents are unable to  meet with the teacher during this time they can have a phone conference with the teacher and also have a progress report  mailed or emailed to them.  This too can be translated to meet the needs of the parent.         2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   P.S. 55 provides a vast amount of opportunities for parents, including parents of ELLs.  P.S. 55 is committed to providing workshops to benefit the needs of all its parents, including parents of ELLs.  Workshops are  provided monthly to parents, including parents of ELLs.  P.S. 55 works with the translation and interpretation unit as needed.  Workshops are offered in both ELA and Math for both upper and lower grade levels.  For parents of students in grades K-2 the  workshops will show them strategies for reading, how to get online access and helpful websites, and give them hands on  activities to do with their child.    Other ways ELL parents can get involved are:   P.S.  55 holds monthy P.T.A meeting on the last Tuesday of each month.    Each year P.S. 55 holds on open house for new parents to attend to come view the school.  Parents are given tours of  classrooms, educated on school programs, and are given a chance to meet the staff.    P.S. 55 hosts a welcome new families breakfast as well as a monthly breakfast with the principal, where ELL parents can come  and get informed about whats going on in P.S. 55.  P.S. 55 has a special 5th grade parent assembly.  Speakers from Intermediate School 7 come to speak about, as well as, answer  questions about to transition to 5th grade to intermediate school.    Moreover, all parents are invited to grade specific curriculum conferences to introduce curriculum to the parents.    Throughout all of the ways parents can get involved, translation services are available if needed.             Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.      P.S. 55 provides a vast amount of community driven school assemblies enabling the students to develop into good citizens,  exposes them to a variety of content based subjects, encourages their involvement and sparks their ambitions to be diverse life- long learners.  Assemblies include: anti-bullying assemblies to teach students the importance of being kind and respectful to one  another, Chinese Acrobats to celebrate the Chinese culture during Chinese New Year, 5  th   Grade Spelling Bee to stimulate  academic motivation, Laser Light Show exposes students to music through the decades, Book club Magic Show blending magic with  books and enhancing the students love of reading.    In addition, P.S. 55 also holds an annual School Carnival, Holiday fairs, Plant sale, Books fairs, Winter Wonderland, Field Days,  Parent/Teacher Basketball game.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Sharon Fishman, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.
