This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Teachers and administrators are committed to giving every individual student a differentiated, academically rigorous  education that considers the individual learning style of each student, preparing them for success in college and  careers. The administration’s attention to teacher effectiveness promotes deeper and longer lasting learning of our  students, and provides a richer educational experience in a culture that instills in them the values of lifelong learning.  MS 67 has a strong, positive school culture with high expectations and support for achievement and responsible social  behavior, involving many stakeholders-students, teachers, school administrators, and parents. It is our belief that this  culture promotes more collegiality, and improves educational outcomes. Our goal of increasing student progress is   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      steeped in aligning all curricula to the Next Generation State Standards and integrating the instructional shifts with  pedagogy. The administration, staff developer, and teacher leaders work with the entire school community to  enhance understanding of how these shifts impact student learning. The administration and school staff take part in  meaningful professional development opportunities provided by our District Office, Borough Field Support Center,  and other outside professional development providers. Teachers engage in rich professional learning opportunities  provided by our staff developer and the members of our Administrative Team connected to our school's instructional  focus and the teachers' instructional and professional goals. The provided information is then turn keyed to all staff  members during teacher professional development time.             2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Louis Pasteur Middle School 67 (MS 67) is located in the Little Neck area of Queens, New York. The present  enrollment is 952 children; 22% are White, 4% are Black, 12% are Hispanic, 60% are Asian, 1% is Multi-Racial, and 1%  are other backgrounds.       We are dedicated to promoting academic achievement by creating a supportive learning environment that recognizes  the unique social, emotional and intellectual needs of young adolescents. We remain committed to providing an  excellent education to all students in a caring, nurturing, and supportive learning environment. We are proud of the  devotion and support each child can expect from our entire staff. We are currently working with different  organizations in an effort to further drive instruction and give support to our teachers. We are collaborating with the  Alley Pond Environmental Center to develop a Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) curriculum where  students will solve a real world problem relating to our environment and its social and economic impact on our local  community.       In response to the importance that language and vocabulary has in the effects of learning across various content  areas, we have developed a system to enhance the student learning of academic vocabulary. Each week, the Staff  Developer distributes a list of five vocabulary words for each grade level that will be introduced in the ELA classes  during that week. Teachers in all content areas reinforce those words and teach students how they apply to their  specific content areas. Also, words which express emotions and feelings have been integrated into the ELA  curriculum. These words are connected to the utilization of a mood meter and to helping meet the social-emotional  learning needs of our students. The intended goal is to expose students to vocabulary words that can have multiple  meanings across academic subjects. Recognizing that these multiple meanings can cause confusion for students,  especially ENL students, we immerse all students in the meanings of the words through experience rather than  definition. In order to meet the expectations of preparing our students for college and career readiness, our goal is to  incorporate the use of learning through complex texts in ELA, Social Studies, and Science on a weekly basis. Teacher  practice for selecting a complex text that is differentiated and appropriate for each student’s readiness level is to take  advantage of such complex text resources as TeenBiz.com and Lexile Analyzer. We believe the systems which have  been designed, create multiple opportunities for student success, and our goal will not only enhance the learning and  performance of our population categorized in our lowest third of performance, but for all students in our community.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      For the 2017-18 school year, _77__% of our students met State standards on the New York State English Language  Arts exam. On the New York State Mathematics exam, _83__% of our students met State standards on the New York  State Mathematics exam. These percentages don't include two classes of 7th grade students and all 8th grade  students who take the Algebra I and Geometry Regents exams. As our goal is to increase percentile ranks in both  English Language Arts (ELA) and Mathematics, all content areas will focus on targeting the academic success of their  lowest third performers. Quarterly, teachers will assess the performance of their lowest third on the quarterly exam.  Based on the data, teachers will select and prioritize the skills each student needs reinforced. During the following  quarter, teachers will confer with students weekly on these skills and provide strategies to enhance student learning  and performance. For teachers of ELA and Mathematics, the forum during which these target sessions take place is  during periods designated for Academic Intervention Services (AIS) or Resource Room instruction; all other content  area teachers will incorporate the target sessions during regular instructional periods. Student progress will be  documented on the conference log sheet located in student portfolios. As a goal, by June 2019, students in the lowest  third of performance in all grades will increase by 5-10% in the median growth percentile relative to our peer horizon  as measured by the New York State Assessment. Lastly, we will continue to strongly encourage participation in taking  the NYS Assessments by having conversations with students and families in order to aim for a minimum 95%  participation rate across our student population. These conversations will focus on the importance of the assessments  in identifying a student's areas of strength and improvement, and the importance of the assessments in preparing  students for standardized assessments in high school and beyond.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The administration’s attention to teacher effectiveness promotes deeper and longer lasting learning of our students,  and provides a richer educational experience in a culture that instills in them the values of lifelong learning. MS 67 has  a strong, positive school culture with high expectations and support for achievement and responsible social behavior,  involving many stakeholders-students, teachers, school administrators, and parents. It is our belief that this culture  promotes more collegiality, and improves educational outcomes. Our goal of increasing student progress is steeped in  aligning all curricula to the Next Generation State Standards and in reaching instructional goals connected to three  Danielson components in Domain 3 (questioning and discussion, student engagement, and assessment). The  administration, staff developer, and teacher leaders work collaboratively to ensure planning and preparation efforts  are focused on meeting the needs of all students on a consistent basis. The administration takes part in meaningful  professional development opportunities provided by our District Office. The provided information is then turn keyed  to all staff members during teacher professional development time.   There has been the most progress made in the areas of Effective School Leadership and Trust as evidenced by the  results of the Learning Environment Survey for the past two years. This year, the teaching staff will focus on the  purposeful use of formative assessment and student-led discussions to drive instruction. In addition, the school  community will focus on the developing the whole child and attending to the social-emotional learning needs of all  members of the school community. There will be quarterly themes to help focus on these needs including Happiness,  Thankfulness, PS I Love You, and Respect for All. 6th grade students will engage in activities through the program  Sanford Harmony which will present scenarios to students which help them learn strategies for building and  maintaining positive peer relationships.    Parents are invited to attend workshops that outline the instructional shifts of the CCLS. Additionally, our school has  made the most progress in building stronger family ties during the forty minute parent engagement block. During this  time, parents meet face to face with teachers and are provided with strategies for assisting their children to perform  at their own personal best. The results of these sessions are evident in the coherence of instruction across grades and  subject areas as the school community works to promote college and career readiness for all students. A major focus  of this school year is to expand these conferences to incorporate elements of increased student ownership through  the implementation of student led conferences where students will present and discuss their current goals and work  products to their teachers and parents In all classrooms, one can observe the application of higher order skills aligned  to Webb’s Depth of Knowledge as all students, including students with disabilities (SWD) and English as New  Language (ENL) students, are engaged in rigorous activities and discussions.

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     Louis Pasteur Middle School 67 has demonstrated a continuous commitment to providing a rigorous and rewarding  educational experience for our students. Over the past few years our school has implemented various programs to  help develop our teacher’s classroom practice, in accordance with the Danielson Framework for teaching, and  enhance the learning opportunities for our students to ensure they are meaningful and relevant. New York State’s  shift to the Next Generation State Standards as well as the Next Generation Science Standards requires that students  use problem-solving skills, learn new science content, analyze informational texts, and apply thinking skills to address  real life problems by integrating science, technology, engineering and math as part of their science and math  curriculum. According to the 2016-17 NYC School Quality Guide, 88% of teachers feel that through these instructional  shifts, "a lot or all of the students in their classes feel challenged." In contrast, 87% of the teachers in District 26 and  85% of overall City teachers responded favorably to this question.    Studies suggest that successful integration of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math disciplines can improve  interest, motivation and achievement in each STEM related field. Thus, another way our teachers have increased  academic rigor is through the collaborative development of various project based learning assignments in math and  science. Over the past four years, our school has implemented STEM related assignments for our 6th and 7th grade  students. Teachers at MS 67 value a rigorous STEM curriculum that empowers students to become innovators and  technologically proficient problem solvers. According to the 2016-17 NYC School Quality Guide, only 72% of students  responded favorably that "in most of their classes, teachers want students to become better thinkers, not just  memorize things." In contrast to MS 67 teacher perceptions, less of our students feel they are applying thinking skills  in their classrooms, compared to 77% and 84 % of students in District 26 and around NYC respectively.    STEM education is a methodology that encourages students to pursue inquiries and solve problems that are relevant  to the world in which they live. For teachers, STEM education provides unique opportunities to grow their practice  with their peers. The solution to the deficits identified by students would require an investment in developing a  rigorous and engaging STEM program also for our 8th graders that will help address these needs. Priorities to help  develop this curriculum would include developing strategic partnerships for cross curricular planning, professional  development for teachers, and additional supports to address the needs of all learners.

They have the opportunity to participate in professional  development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement.      Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Our school has worked to strategically program teacher and student schedules to allow for open collaboration for  teachers on both horizontal and vertical levels in departments and across departments. Currently, we are continuing  the practice of designating time for teachers to meet as department teacher teams to discuss curriculum planning for  all grades within their content. Trends will be analyzed based on summative assessments such as quarterly exams and  standardized assessments so that necessary adjustments can be made to units and lessons. Teachers also will meet in  grade teams to discuss strategies to meet the needs of individual students and create an action plan for both the  school and the home. For the 2018-2019 school year, we will create opportunities for teachers to visit each other and  experience best practices put into action. To supplement these experiences, we will provide teachers with research- based texts to further develop their teaching. We will also reflect and make connections among teachers'  Instructional and professional goals, the school's instructional focus, MPPR Priorities, and the foci teachers identify  when intervisiting colleagues. For the 2017-18 school year, the component average for 3b was 3.13. The component  average was 3.25, and the component average for 3d was 3.22. Teachers' instructional and professional goals are  connected to these components within Domain 3, and an MPPR priority of challenging students consistently has been  identified and is connected to the lowest average rated component of 3b. During classroom evaluative visits, the  types of questions being asked by the teacher will be one focus due to the impact that questioning can have on the  level of discussion and engagement within the classroom. The purpose of the intervisitations will be observing  strategies and best teaching practices from colleagues that they can utilize to help them meet or exceed their  individual instructional and professional goals set at their Initial Planning Conferences. These instructional and  professional goals are connected to the school's Instructional Focus of creating and maintaining a supportive learning  environment for all students. The Model Teacher will create a tool which allows colleagues to see when best practices  are being showcased throughout the school.    According to our school’s most recent Quality Review, under “What the school needs to improve”: Furthermore,  teacher peers are not an integral part of the evaluation process through inter-visits or other structured routines in  which teachers can receive support from school leaders in addition to their peers. The absence of these structures  hinders the schools ability to maximize the results of the teacher evaluation process. During intervisitations, teachers  will focus on the utilization of challenging questions and discussion prompts (3b) and various types of formative  assessments (3d) for the purpose of meeting all students' needs in a supportive learning environment. Another purpose  is to ensure students are engaged in their learning (3b).        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers.

Teachers will have participated in  professional development centered in  improving instructional practice through  classroom inter-visitations, weekly  reflections on teaching, and weekly  discussions on research-based text specific  to their content area.Teachers will debrief  each Monday during the designated  Professional Development time to discuss  best practices and strategies for working  with individual student groups including  Gifted and Talented students, Students with  Disabilities, and English Language Learners.    Teachers will work in Grade and Department  teacher teams to improve their practice  regarding differentiation, rigor, and  relevance. By studying the work of Webb's  DOK and Bloom's Taxonomy, more higher- level thinking questions and tasks will be  infused into class lessons and units. These  types of questions will be utilized in  connection with the school-identified  priority of striving to challenge students  consistently.   Teachers will attend professional  development opportunities that are city- wide, through District 26, or through the  BFSC and connected to their individual  professional and instructional goals.

Monthly Coffee and Conversation meetings, monthly focused presentations at PTA meetings, parent-teacher  conferences (November, March, and May), and monthly School Leadership Team meetings will provide other  pathways to communicate about the school's instructional priorities and about how to collaboratively meet students'  needs. The Administrative Team will oversee how successful these various forums for communication are throughout  the year. There will be a check-in with the PTA and SLT In January 2019 to gauge the satisfaction of the parent  community with the various forms of communication being utilized.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   According to the 2016-17 Learning Environment Survey, an overall score of 4.46 in Effective School Leadership was  achieved and an overall score of 3.59 in Trust was achieved. According to the 2017-18 Learning Environment Survey,  an overall score of 3.72 in Trust was achieved. Both of these scores exceeded the District and City-wide averages. Our  goal as an administrative team is to increase the number of positive responses in the areas of effective school  leadership and trust amongst the teachers, parents, and students.       In order to achieve this goal, the school leadership will continue increase the amount of transparency and  communication within the school community. Principal Newsletters and an improved website are two ways in which  our school community will be informed about how we are consistently working to achieve a supportive learning  environment. Also, Coffee and Conversation meetings will give parents opportunities to bring forward grade-level and  school-wide topics and issues that should be discussed. In addition, a functional School Leadership Team and  committees (including teachers, parents, and students) will be utilized to gather the ideas and strengths of the staff  for the purpose of meeting the needs of all students.   A staff developer and team of teacher leaders will lead instructional initiatives throughout the 2018-19 school year  including working with other teachers in departments to create targeted professional development opportunities for  staff members. This will include collaborating with the Administrative Team to craft professional learning  opportunities that will meet the needs of individual and small groups of teachers for the purpose of meeting the  needs' of all students.    Teachers are being provided feedback from lessons which focuses on creating more student-centered classrooms. The  feedback is connected to utilizing Danielson components 3b and 3d to create an environment where there is  increased student engagement where students feel challenged.    In addition, there was a mid-point survey conducted in which staff responses decreased a bit from last year's learning  environment survey. We are continuing to speak to staff members individually and in departments to find out how  they can be better supported. An end-of-year survey will be conducted to find out what further support they need-  including resources and professional development.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Our school has worked to improve open communication with families in a variety of forums. Over the last four years,  we have used a school wide online grading system that allowed parents to view their child’s academic progress in all  of their classes. For the 2018-2019 school year, we will use Skedula (Pupil Path) which is a more advanced progress  monitoring system. This system allows direct communication between parents, teachers, and students. Parents have  access to every teacher’s school email address, thus allowing direct communication if they choose. Teachers respond  to both parents and teachers within 24 hours after receiving their messages. Parents can also call the main office and  leave messages for specific teachers; teachers will respond within 24 hours of receiving the message. Notices sent  home with the students are translated into a variety of languages, based on ATS data. Messages to all parents are  sent via Skedula as well and are translated in most languages. Our staff is fluent in a variety of languages and can  provide translations and interpretation as needed in Chinese, Korean, Spanish, Greek, and Hindi, to name a few. If we  do encounter a language in which no staff member can translate, we will utilize the services from the Translation and  Interpretation Unit of the DOE. Our parent coordinator (fluent in Chinese and Korean) sends out email blasts on a  regular basis, informing parents about upcoming events. She conducts parent workshops on timely topics that are  relevant to parents of school age children. We also utilize a school messenger which calls all homes/ cell phones  informing parents/guardians about upcoming events and important notices. We will enhance our school website  (beyond the regular DOE website) and post relevant information for both parents and students. The PTA website  posts relevant notices and information as well. Parents/Guardians are invited to monthly "Coffee and Conversations  With the Principal" to discuss relevant information and address parent questions/concerns. During the weekly 40  minute parent engagement sessions, our teacher teams will schedule individualized conferences for parents of  targeted students. This will provide powerful opportunities for parents/students to advocate for their own learning.  We have established ties with the community for research-based projects to enhance our STEM program, with  projects such as investigating environmental changes on climate. This is through a partnership with the Alley Pond  Environmental Center in Queens as well as the Douglaston Manor Environmental Association. Based on a number of  parent surveys administered during the 2017-2018 school year, we will offer more evening activities such as a drama  production, a district-wide STEM centric event, Night of the Arts for each grade, and an Incoming Grade 6 Orientation,  a G & T Open House for incoming sixth graders, a number of High School Application Workshops, NYS Testing  Information Workshop, and Internet Safety Workshops to name a few, that will include students, teachers, parents,  and members of the community. We have looked at parent attendance at school-wide events from the 2017-2018  school year and we experienced a 20% increase from the 2016-2017 school year. We are hoping to experience an  additional increase in parent attendance in this school year (2018-2019). Parent workshops will be conducted through  Thrive, NYC on relevant topics. Our parents have indicated that they would like more opportunities for their children  to display their talents and become engaged with their children at school-wide events. We have additional priority  needs for this school year as well as an action plan that will begin in September. For example, in addition to our  enhanced communication systems between the school and home, we will have a full-time after-school SONYC  program available to our student body, through a community based organization, the Samuel Field Y, that will be  housed in our school. This program will be offered every day from 2:20 PM until 5:30 PM. This program will offer a  range of activities, academics, sports, interest clubs and leadership opportunities. Furthermore, we will offer an after- school activity schedule in addition to the SONYC program that will enhance opportunities for students. Activities will  include participation in a drama production, a Cabaret performance, a chess club, a gardening club, yoga/mindfulness   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33      classes, a Latin club, an archery program, as well as volleyball, badminton, baseball, basketball, soccer, and tennis  teams to name a few. The sports teams will participate in league play throughout the season. This is in response to an  after-school activity survey that was given to students and parents during the 2017-2018 school year.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and  Time-bound.   By June 2019, there will be a 10% increase in parent involvement at school-wide events, parent workshops, parent- teacher meetings, and PTA meetings/events combined.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.  Strategies to address the needs of students with  disabilities, English language learners, and other high- need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited,  SIFE, STH).   Administrative Team members along with the Staff Developer  will conduct workshops for teachers with research based  professional development on how to facilitate effective  parent/student conferences. These conferences will take place  during the three scheduled parent-teacher conference sessions  in November, March, and May as well as on Tuesday afternoons  and other times during the school day. Conferences will be  scheduled by utilizing an online scheduling platform by parents.  With the work of the grade-level teacher teams focused on  meeting individual students' needs, arrangements for meetings  bringing parents and teams of teachers together will be made.  These meetings will be conducted to discuss next steps that will  be followed up by the team of teachers in order to determine  progress and if adjustments need to be made.    We will offer a free after-school community based organizational  program in conjunction with the Samuel Field Y as well as offer a  number of after-school clubs and teams with a wide range of  activities in order to enhance opportunities for all students. This  involvement of students will lead to more opportunities for  parents to come see their children participate as members of  clubs, teams, and activities in games and competitions.    Parents will receive invitations in the form of emails, PupilPath  messages, flyers, Phone Messenger messages, and school and  PTA website postings with parent reminders to support and  celebrate their children's successes by attending evening events  such as a drama production, a Cabaret performance, a STEM  centric event, Night/Day of the Arts for each grade, Family  Fitness Night, and an incoming sixth grade orientation. This will  help to increase parent involvement in our school.   We seek to improve communication with parents and students in  a variety of ways, including implementing an enhanced online  grading and communication system (Skedula), translate notices  in every language as needed, send email blasts to parents via  Pupil Path (Skedula), the phone messenger, and the PTA website,  and conduct parent workshops on issues relevant to parents.

Every parent and student has a password  and they are able to view grades/progress everyday as well as communicate with teachers as often as needed.  Teachers communicate with parents via this system as well.   Committees of teachers, students, and parents have been formed including STEM and School Wellness, and they  meet on a regular basis in order to gather input from the entire school community about initiatives and ideas. We  have monthly parent "Coffee and Conversation Meetings" with the Principal/Administration and it is an open forum  to discuss current school happenings and address areas of concern. We have seen a 10.5% increase in attendance  from last year. Our monthly PTA meeting attendance has also grown approximately 10% since last year. We have  conducted day/evening parent workshops on a variety of topics such as "High School Admissions", “High School  Workshop”, "Senior Trip to Boston, MA Information Meeting", “Elevate Education Workshop for Parents”, "New  Parent Workshops”, and a "Gifted and Talented Workshop for Fifth Grade Parents" and a “STEM Open House for Fifth  Grade Parents”, to name a few. In February, we conducted a workshop entitled "Mindfulness", and in May we will  have an "Incoming Grade 6 Orientation". In all of these meetings and workshops, we have Chinese, Korean, and  Spanish interpreters to assist with those parents in need of clarification in their native language.    As a result of our parent survey, we are offering more evening/weekend activities to enhance family engagement.  Members of our school as well as students/parents attended a bowling night in the fall, “The Grinch on Broadway” in  December, a Harlem Magic Masters Basketball game in January, an “All Star Basketball Game/Brooklyn Nets game in  February and March, and will attend an ice-skating event in March. Our school musical production "Seussical" will  take place in March. We held a "Family Wellness Night" in February as well and we will participate in the district  Family Welness Night in March. We are having our first Alumni Event in March. We will hold our "Night of the Arts"  events for every grade in April and May.

N/A        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Louis Pasteur Middle School 67Q, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I,  Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   [School name] will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

The school was built in 1956 as a K-9 school; however it has evolved as a middle school  with grades 6-8.  The present enrollment is 952 children; 20% are White, 4% are Black, 13% are  Hispanic, 61% are Asian, 1% are Native Americans and 1% other.  Our English Language Learners (ELL) population, which consists of 45 students, is Korean  (14%), Chinese (58%), Spanish (12%) and Other (16%). 8% are at the Entering Level, 18 % are  at the  Emerging Level, 18% at the Transitioning Level , 32% at the Expanding Level, and 24%  at the Commanding Level as measured by the 2018 NYSESLAT exam.  This free-standing ENL  program services all grades.  Our program consists of mainly departmentalized ENL and content  courses that infuse ENL strategies.  Our model is stand-alone and integrated, where students  spend the majority of their day in all English content instruction and are brought together from  various classes for English acquisition.  Our 5 NYC licensed, NYS certified ENL teachers teach  English Language Arts, Social Studies, Science , Math and ENL (Literacy).  There are 19 stand- alone classes and 44 integrated classes per week.  The language of instruction is  English.  Depending on their NYSITELL and NYSESLAT scores, all entering and emerging  students are given 360 minutes of instruction per week; transitioning and expanding students are  seen 180 minutes per week, and commanding students are given 90 minutes per week, in  addition to their regular English Language Arts classes.  It is our intent to start a very aggressive after school program through the Rosetta course (a  supplemental language program that offers individualized instruction) and direct teacher  instruction in a classroom setting, targeting our 45 ENL students in the acquisition of academic  language  for the state-wide exams, and success in the content classes.  We want to insure that  our struggling ENL students (Entering students whose reading grade levels are below 3rd grade)  get the proper support in order to succeed.  In these after-school classes,  the Title III teacher will  use many of the strategies utilized by the ENL teacher – bridging, contextualization, reciprocal  teaching, metacognition, and most importantly text representation.  Research shows that ELLs  need to develop academic English skills along with content knowledge to be successful in  school.  Through effective instruction in the classroom, the regular, grade-level curriculum is  taught to English language learners utilizing the workshop model which makes the content  concepts comprehensible while promoting the students’ academic English language development  (Chamot & O’Malley, 1987; Cradall, 1993, Echevarria, Vogt & Short, 2000.)  Federal  regulations mandate that all children must be assessed to monitor their progress.  Therefore, our  ELL students take all NYS exams in ELA, Math ,and appropriate Regents exams in the eighth  grade.  Students here less than 1 year are exempt from ELA State exams, but take the  NYSESLAT.  Since the classes will be given on two different days of the week from 2:30 PM   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   to 3:30 PM for a duration of 23 weeks, the majority of our ELL students should be able to attend  each individual class.      This after-school program would begin in the end of November and run for approximately 23  weeks, ending in April.  Parents/Guardians of these students eligible for the program (all 45 ENL  students) will be notified by letter in their preferred language and in English; with phone call  follow-up if necessary.  All of the students will work with the English Rosetta Stone  program one hour per week and then work with the ENL teacher and ELA teacher on English  skill improvement in a classroom one hour per week.  Additional supplemental materials will be  used that are distinct from those used for daily instruction.   The students will be divided into two  groups of similar abilities; therefore the classes will flip/flop on alternate days, utilizing both the  ENL teacher and the ELA teacher.  The ENL teacher and the ELA teacher  will have different  duties in the Title III program.  The ENL teacher will focus on listening and speaking skills; the  ELA teacher will focus on reading skills.  Student attendance and assessments will be carefully  maintained by the teachers in this program.  In the after school Rosetta Stone/ELA skills course, one NYS certified ENL teacher and the  supervisor, who is a former LOTE/ENL licensed/certified teacher will co-plan weekly  lessons.  The ENL teacher will concentrate on reading skills to increase comprehension, as well  as listening and speaking skills.  The teacher will familiarize the students with the test format,  note taking and reading and writing strategies to assist our ELLs to succeed in school  and  on exams. The teacher will also work with all the students who have been identified as  mandated to take the NYS ELA exam.  In the program, students who have performed at the entering and emerging levels and have been  in the country for less than one year will be targeted to learn basic interpersonal skills, and  the  day to day language skills needed to interact socially with other people.  This social language is  not cognitively demanding, but needed for a newcomer to survive and become comfortable in  his/her surroundings.  These skills usually develop within a year after the students'  arrival.  Through the Rosetta Stone course, students will develop core  skills in reading, writing,  speaking and listening through features such as proprietary speech-recognition technology  incorporated into lessons and activities to help students improve their pronunciation, immersion- based technology that replicates the strengths of a real-world learning environment and activates  the brain's natural ability to learn language, carefully sequenced content to introduce new  vocabulary and grammar by building upon previous content, speech-recognition technology to  help students adjust speaking to match native-speaker pronunciation, immediate feedback on  every response to help reinforce key foundational concepts and correct learning.  This is in  accordance with the Common Core State Standards.  With Rosetta Stone, programs are  individualized and geared to the specific needs of each child.  The teacher will continually follow  up with assessments to ensure understanding and check on progress.  Academic language acquisition isn't just the understanding of content area vocabulary.  In  addition to the English Rosetta Stone course, skills such as comparing, classifying, synthesizing,  evaluating, and inferring are crucial strategies that ELL's need to succeed in the content  areas.  As the language becomes more cognitively demanding, new ideas, concepts and language  are presented to the students at the same time; therefore students need time and support to  become proficient in academic areas.  Studies show this can take from 5 to 7 years.  Therefore, it  is our intent to support these students in content area vocabulary and concepts so they may  succeed in the demands that the content courses require and make them college and career  ready.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55         Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.     rationale  teachers to receive training          schedule and duration      name of provider   topics to be covered   Begin description here:                            In compliance with Federal Regulations, the ENL department is trained to analyze and evaluate  the NYSESLAT an annual test that measures student progress towards meeting these standards;  The NYS English as a Second Language Achievement Test.  The ENL and ELA teachers will  attend a number of ENL workshops through the DOE, quarterly ENL Liaison meetings given  through District 26, the annual New York State Association for Bilingual Education Conference,  as well as NYSESLAT Training.  NYSESLAT training will be provided by the DOE and it is  usually half-day training. The ENL teacher will turn-key the strategies learned to the teaching  staff at department meetings, monthly staff meetings as well as staff development opportunities  in our school.  Teachers will also receive a one hour refresher training for Rosetta Stone by a  representative of Rosetta Stone, in order to utilize it to best serve the needs of each individual  child.   The ENL teacher and the ELA teacher working in Title III, will attend professional development  opportunities that take place within our district on a regular basis.  These professional  development opportunities will be of no cost to the Title III program.  These programs are  generally one day workshops covering topics such as reading, writing and communication  strategies targeted to improve comprehension and fluency.  The ELA department, including the  Assistant Principal, Staff Development Coach (a literacy teacher) and all ELA teachers are  targeted for these sessions as well.  The ENL teacher also articulates on a weekly basis with the  mainstream teachers to assess their mutual students' progress and attends weekly ELA coach  meetings.  This allows the ENL teacher to plan accordingly, so as to clear up any new concepts,  which might prove difficult for beginner or transitioning/Expanding students.  Also, the ENL  teachers are given updated copies of each unit of study in ELA; this includes the latest strategies  being taught with each grade level.

Translators are available if the  parents need one.  Open school week is conducted in November, March and May prior to the  Parent/Teacher Conferences. Translation and Interpretation services are available to all  parents.  Parents can visit each child's class to see how each one functions.  In addition,  Parent/Teacher Conferences are held in the afternoon and evening in November and March, and  an evening conference will be conducted in May.  Again, translation/interpretation services are  provided during these conferences as well.  Other parent workshops are given on a monthly  basis.  The four Assistant Principals as well as the Parent Coordinator will facilitate these  workshops.  They include: "Getting Acquainted With MS67-Parent Orientation", "Getting Your  Child Off to the Right Start", "Skedula/PupilPath Workshop", "High School Information  Workshop", "Elevate Education", "Bullying/Cyber-Bullying Workshop", "Understanding the  NYS ELA State Exam" , "Understanding the NYS Math Exam", and "Study Skills/Time  Management Workshop", to name a few.  These workshops will be of no cost to the Title III  program.  Flyers in different languages will be sent to the parents.   Messages are sent  electronically in PupilPath in every language.   Letters (Preferred Language of Parents) and  monthly calendars are sent home with the students and a phone messenger calls each child's  home as well to ensure that the parents are informed about the workshops and other events at  school.  Parents also have access to their child's grades at all time through Pupil Path, an online  grading system that is used by every staff member.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Teachers use a variety of different strategies to assess student readiness for a particular unit of study and to plan their  instruction around the needs the students demonstrate.  We use mini-lesson assessments created by teachers and track  students progress in order to inform instruction.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The Do-Now, at the beginning of the lesson, assesses material taught the previous day.  There is an assessment conducted at  the end of the mini-lesson to determine student understanding of the new material taught.  There is also an independent task  related to the mini-lesson to ensure comprehension.  The teacher circulates around the room and works with individual  students to clarify material and re-teach concepts if necessary.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Teacher feedback, student performance in class, ongoing classroom assessments,quizzes and tests, quarterly exams, projects,  and ultimately student performance on the NYSESLAT are all taken into consideration when evaluating the success of our ELL  programs.  Based on the results of these summative assessments, teachers will be able to address specific areas of need and  will be able to design curriculum to meet the needs of all students.             4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Teachers meet weekly (vertically and horizontally) to track progress of their students.  Teachers offer extra help and contact  parents when necessary.  Early morning and after school intervention programs are offered..  Parent meetings are set up as  well with translation and interpretation provided.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Not Applicable     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Data patterns across proficiency levels and grades on the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT are utilized for planning and instruction  across all content areas.  Data patterns tell us that listening is the strongest modality and writing appears to be the weakest  modality.  We create student and teacher programs based on the results of the NYSESLAT and NYSITELL exams, making sure  students are placed in the appropriate groups for their levels.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Teachers continually evaluate data and adjust lesson plans to meet the needs of the students.  Teacher teams meet weekly to  examine student data and performance.  Based on these findings, lessons are created to meet the needs of every  learner.  Teachers continually adjust their lessons based on the pulse of the class.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   MS 67's ELL program is an English immersion pullout/push in program that adheres to the new state mandated  guidelines.  All ELL students are mixed hetereogenously by class and grade.  The entering and emerging students are  pulled out for 180 minutes with the ELL teacher.  They are pulled from non-core curriculum classes such as  Spanish.  All levels are also seen in an integrated class with the ELL teacher and a general education teacher (ELA,  Science, or Social Studies) for 180 minutes according to the schedule and level.     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Not Applicable   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Not Applicable      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61      a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Entering and emerging ELL students will receive 180 minutes in stand alone ENL and 180 minutes of integrated  ENL.  Transitioning and expanding ELLs will receive 180 minutes in integrated ENL.  Commanding students will receive 90  minutes in integrated ENL.  This is built into each student's schedule as well as the schedule of the ELL instructor.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.       MS 67 is committed to academic rigor through a challenging curriculum which reflects the Common Core Learning  Standards. ELLs acquire language through a variety of methods and strategies.  For content area instruction, which is usually  determined through articulation with the subject area teacher, language objectives as well as content objectives are always a  priority.  The ENL teacher supports the content area with vocabulary and the academic language needed to understand and  process the subject matter.  This scaffolding uses a variety of materials such as pictures, dictionaries, technology, newspapers,  magazine articles, etc.  Unfamiliar concepts and problematic language are always given attention in order to make input  comprehensive.  Native language material and student "translators" are often used for additional support.  Writing, a priority  here at MS 67, uses the Columbia University Teachers College Workshop model across all content areas.   The ELA Department  utilizes the  Expeditionary Learning Modules for Grades 6, 7, and 8.  The Social Studies Department uses the textbook and  materials for Grade 6 entitled: "Eastern Hemisphere" by Holt McDougal.  Grade 7 uses the Holt McDougal textbook entitled  ""US History and New York History:Beginnings to 1877".  The 8  th   grade Social Studies textbook is "United State History:Post  Civil War to the Present" by Holt McDougal. For Mathematics, Grade 6 and 7 uses the CMP Program; for Grade 8, they use the  Pearson textbook entitled "Algebra I".  For Science, the 6  th   and 7  th   grade uses the Glencoe textbook "New York  Science".  Our eighth graders take either Regents Earth Science or Biology.  The textbooks used are "New York Earth  Science/Physical Setting" or "New York Biology-Living Environment".  All work across all content areas is either translated or  modified, depending on each student's proficiency level.  As students become more proficient in the language, attention is  given to higher order thinking skills such as summarizing, analyzing and thinking inferentially.  These skills are developed  through a series of questioning strategies.  In order for ELLs  to maintain congruence with their English speaking counterparts,  experience more rigorous academic instruction and enriched language, lessons and tasks are modified.  Teachers also offer  extra help to all ELL students as well.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      Spanish-speaking children are evaluated on the Spanish LAB R, after the NYSITELL is administered in English.  ELLs are  provided native language versions of standardized tests such as the state Math and Science assessments.  When possible,  informal assessments are given in the native language by pedagogical staff, when students functioning is not  progressing.  Parent interviews are conducted with new arrivals the day of registration, and later during individual  Parent/Teacher conferences conducted throughout the year.  These conferences give needed information on each student,  and school performance in their homeland.  These interviews can also indicate the language performance of the  parents.  Individual parent meeting are conducted to ensure student success.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Currently, MS 67 only has one SIFE student. The education plan for this student targets instruction in all four modalities and  will be designed based on a diagnostic/prescriptive approach.  Assessment data will be carefully analyzed to target skills and  pinpoint weaknesses.  Scaffolding will support language and content area objectives.  Additional support will be provided by  peer tutoring, AIS, and after school programs.  Parents will be kept apprised of the educational plan, remediation, progress,  etc., in hopes this engagement will create more stability.  Newcomers to MS 67 receive a comprehensive program designed to address the students' need for language acquisition,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62      cognitive development, and social adjustment.  A variety of methods and strategies are used with beginners in school for less  than three years.  Small group task oriented lessons drive instruction.  Along with modeling and repetition, these lessons make  input more comprehensible.  In addition, they develop vocabulary and verbal skills.  Reading and writing naturally develop  from these hands-on tasks.  Instructional materials include Big Books, picture books, language experience charts, dramatic  play, to name a few.  Realia is used as often as possible.  The Writer's Workshop model is used as soon as possible and it is a  priority.  Grammar is naturally developed through the students' own writing as opposed to artificially in isolated  exercises.  Subject area instruction is supported by scaffolding and content area input, and when appropriate, higher reasoning  skills will be introduced.  Native language support such as library books, student translators, electronic translators, etc., will be  used when available.  At present, MS 67 has one long -term ELL.  The education plan for this students is similar to the plan discussed above.  One  modification would be for the ELL teacher to push into major subject classrooms such as ELA, Math, Science and Social  Studies as much as possible to scaffold vocabulary and content.  The ELL teacher will work individually with targeted students  as well.  Additional support would be provided through our AIS program.  If deemed necessary, the students will be evaluated  by the SBST Team after second language interference has been ruled out.  Counseling and related services may be suggested  and implemented.  At present, MS 67 does not have any long-term ELL's of six-plus years.  If in the event these students become part of our  population, the same plans used for SIFE and long-term ELL's (4-6 years) would be used for these students.  Again, every effort  would be made to rule out second language interference as the impediment to student progress.  Once this determination has  been made, the student would be referred to the SBST team to begin an initial evaluation.  Parent involvement would have to  be ongoing, and this relationship would, hopefully ensure parent cooperation with referral decisions.  Students who become proficient receive AIS services when deemed necessary.  The AIS teacher focuses on reading  comprehension and writing skills in conjunction with subject class lessons. As per CR Part 154.2, all former ELLs are serviced for  up to two years. They are serviced through integrated ENL courses.  The general education teacher, who holds a certification  in TESOL, will provide instruction and support to our ELL students in content specific subjects.   All ELL students receive the same testing accommodations. They are give time and a half on exams, along with glossaries or  translated versions of the exam when applicable.         6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?     Instructional strategies include the Reading/Writing Workshop Model as sanctioned by Teachers College of Columbia  University. Entering and Emerging students study a minimum of 8 ENL Periods.  Transitioning and Expanding students study  ENL 4 periods a week as part of an integrated ENL program. The Commanding students will receive integrated ENL at least 2  period a week. The Assistant Principal, Parent Coordinator and ENL Coordinator review all ELL students' proficiency using data  obtained from ATS.  All students are then programmed for the required amount of ENL following the mandate of state  compliance rules.  The classes are heterogeneous but graded. However, entering and emerging students will receive stand-alone ENL classes in  which all four content areas are addressed (English, Math Science, and Social Studies). As stated above all students are  receiving the mandated amount of instructional minutes in ENL.   ELLs with special needs are given resource room, speech, occupational therapy etc. These services are programmed for them  in their weekly schedule.  The ENL teacher works with the Special Education teacher and uses a variety of instructional  materials: Picture books that cross over to the content areas. Thematic units on descriptive writing, poetry, author studies, and  reading and writing strategies through the TC Workshop Model. Newcomers and beginners use the ACCESS Building Literacy  Through Learning, Great Source Education Group. All other classes use Grammar Practice Simplified Books B – F, Essential  Learning Products. All About the USA and For Your Information, Pearson Longman. ESL Smart - Ready to Use Life Skills&  Academic Activities for Grades K-8. In addition, the ENL classroom has a well-stocked classroom library fitting the needs of all  proficiency levels. Students can borrow books for ELA or any other content area throughout the year. The ENL teacher also  creates many reading and writing units using the materials in the classroom, or from her own personal library. All lessons are  aligned to the Core Curriculum of ELA and meet ELL standards and address all 4 ELL modalities of Listening, Speaking, Reading   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63      and Writing. The ENL department is under the direct supervision of the Assistant Principal in charge of the Social Studies  department.             7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  ELL-SWDs are seen properly depending on their proficiency level. In order to place these ELLs in the least restrictive  environment, they are placed in heterogeneous classrooms and the ENL teacher will either push-in or pullout the student  depending on their level.  The school's special education teachers have received professional development for working with  ELLs, specifically ELLs with disabilities. The child's ENL teacher and special education teacher work together to create targeted  instruction for these specific students.         8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.   Our ENL program is a pull-out/push-in program servicing children in grades 6-8, 5 classes per day, 5 days per week. (7 pull-out  classes and 18 push-in). The language of instruction is English. The program model is heterogeneous.  However,  Entering and  Emerging students are seen in pull-out classes 5 times a week along with integrated core classes in ELA or Social Studies 5  times a week . Transitioning, Expanding and Commanding students seen 5 times a week as push-ins in their ELA, Science or  Social Studies classes. The Assistant Principal, Parent Coordinator and ENL Coordinator review all ELL students' proficiency  using data obtained from ATS.  All students are then programmed for the required amount of ENL following the mandate of  state compliance rules.    Students receive glossaries and dictionaries for each subject.  In ELA, Math, Social Studies, and Science, students are provided  with native language materials as appropriate, scaffolded materials, leveled readings, dictionaries and glossaries, vocabulary  re-enforcement , to name a few.  The ELL teacher and ELA, Science, Social Studies, and Math teachers co-plan to ensure that  ELL students understand the subject material.  The ELL teacher as well as the content teachers will give extra help to ELL  students to ensure comprehension.  The Rosetta Stone program is utilized as well in the student's native language.  Students  take exams (formal and informal assessments) in all content areas and the data from these exams are continually evaluated to  ensure intervention effectiveness.  AIS programs are offered during school and after-school as well targeting weak areas.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      This year, with the compliance of the New York State regulations, commanding students will be seen and serviced utilizing the  integrated ENL class format.  There will be an after-school program for ENL students utilizing computer technology to drive  instruction.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.   We have AIS programs that meet during the school day.  Every program has talents built into the schedule, such as Art, Dance,  Music, Drama, Chorus, Robotics, Coding, Creative Writing, Film, Etc.  Reading periods are incorporated into every child's  schedule as well.  Self-sustaining and athletic programs are offered after school.   Teachers offer extra help to every student  during lunch periods as well. The school invites ELLs to participate by translating the information about these programs for the  students. ELL are mainstreamed with the other students to fully participate in all the talent classes that the school offers. ELLs  are automatically programmed for these classes.         12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  The ENL and subject area teachers use a variety of materials to support our ELLs.  These include picture books that cross over  content areas, Oxford picture dictionaries, Grammar Practice Simplified, Essential Learning Products, All About the USA, For   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64         Your Information, and Pearson Longman Ready to Use Life Skills & Academic Activities.  This variety of materials provide our  ELLs with sufficient content to support and guide whatever subgroups may exist in their classrooms.  Reading and writing skills  are developed through thematic units (Expeditionary Learning) on descriptive writing, reading a variety of genres with written  responses, author studies, etc.  All lessons are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards and curriculum, and include  attention to all modalities.  In addition, both subject area and ENL classrooms have well stocked libraries fitting the needs of all  proficiency levels. Spanish, Korean and Chinese students are offered books in their language to help for translation purposes.  Technology is an integral part of the curriculum and in addition to whole class instruction, the school library has computers  available for student research and written reports, etc.  The students use the Rosetta Stone Program, which is offered in their  home language, in particular.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Native language support is provided for our ELLs as soon as they enter the school.  Newcomers are assigned a “friend” who  speaks the same language and acts as a guide and helper.   Classroom and the ENL room libraries have dual language books  and dictionaries.  Students are encouraged to bring electronic translators and use them as much as possible.  In order to foster  cultural literacy, native language stories are compared to similar American stories which shows a respect for other languages  and cultures.  DOE translators are available for parent/teacher conferences, referrals, etc.  Students are provided with native  language versions of formal assessments, when available.  Our Parent Coordinator is fluent in both Mandarin and Korean.  Our  Assistant Principal, Mrs. Choit is fluent in Spanish.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    ELLs are assigned to age appropriate grade level classrooms based on the NYC given chart.  Pull-out services are determined by  grade.  Instruction parallels the subject matter of the grade.  All teachers/staff have been trained and/or skilled in ENL  methodology, and  instruction and support is given in age and grade appropriate groups within the classroom.        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Our school does not share a building with another school.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   There is a student orientation prior to the beginning of school.  However, most ELL's arrive after school begins in  September.  Parent orientations take place at that time. ELL parents are also seen regularly throughout the year during the  Parent Engagement time on Tuesday afternoons. The ENL teacher and parent coordinator are involved in planning these  activities.        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    For Expanding and Commanding level students, Spanish as a foreign language is offered.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?

Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  This plan is based on educationally sound ideas such as enhancing student performance, increasing verbal interaction among  ELL's, contextualizing language during instruction, reducing student anxiety, and getting learners actively involved in the  classroom, to name a few.  All ELL personnel attend weekly professional development sessions at MS 67, that cover a myriad  of topics relevant to improving student progress and student well-being.  The ELL teachers attend ELA, Math, Science, and  Social Studies meetings, where student progress and assimilation are discussed and strategies are implemented to help every  learner succeed both academically and emotionally.  During professional development sessions on Mondays, the ELL teacher,  Ms. Scoufaras gives professional development sessions to the staff which includes the assistant principals, subject area  teachers, paraprofessionals, guidance counselors, the SBST team, special education teachers, the occupational therapist, the  speech therapist, the secretaries, and the parent coordinator on a variety of topics such as: differentiated instruction for ELLs,  assimilation techniques to help our ELL students, language acquisition techniques for ELLs, TPR instruction, and scaffolding  techniques, ELL success in the middle school, to name a few.     Teachers are encouraged to log on on the New York City Department of Education website and check the section entitled "DOE  Professional Development Offerings" in order to find courses relating to our ELL population that they could  attend.  Additionally, the Queens borough offers courses that could be adapted to ELL students.  The ELL teacher has attended  NYSESLAT and NYSITELL training, the ELL teacher has attended the LOTE Conference and went to workshops targeting  language development and assimilation techniques for ELLs, integrating language and content, and co-teaching strategies  during the conference.  The ENL teacher has also attended thinking map training and CR-154 training. In the past, Teacher's  College came to the school on a weekly basis to train the staff, including our ELL teacher, on reading and writing techniques for  middle school children, including ELLs.  Additional staff development takes place at faculty conferences, department meetings  and during PD sessions administered by the school's district/borough. There are opportunities for the ELL teacher to plan  collaboratively with other departments, in particular the ELA department. This allows the ELL teacher to plan accordingly, so as  to clear up any new vocabulary or concepts, which might prove difficult for entering and emerging students.  During staff  development sessions, the ELL teacher is able to identify skills and strategies that can be implemented by the mainstream  teachers. The ELL teacher also provides at least 15 % of all professional development training throughout the year for all  teachers and staff.  The ELL teacher  will receive 50% of her professional development in relation to ELL services such as co- teaching strategies, integrating language and content.  Records of Professional Development/ENL Training are stored in the  office of the Assistant Principal. They are continually updated and maintained.         2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  The ENL teacher attends monthly liaison meetings with schools in our district, and speaks to the other liaisons about the  students who will be articulating into our school in September.  During staff orientation in September, the ENL teacher meets  with staff members and reviews NYSESLAT progress for all ENL students in the middle school and turnkeys the data and  information about the incoming ENL students.  She explains to them what skills, strategies, etc. each student needs in order to  be successful in middle school.  Throughout the year, the ENL teacher continually articulates with the entire staff to assess the  students' progress and continually analyzes data.  In June, the ENL teachers meets with the feeder high school guidance  counselors to discuss the progress and needs of our ENL students as they transition to the high school.  MS 67 provides professional development to all teachers that addresses the needs of ELL's.  Professional development hours  include at least 15% of the required professional development hours for all teachers prescribed by CR Part 80 that include  focusing on best practices for co-teaching strategies, language acquisition, and integrating language and content instruction  for all ELL's.  ENL teachers will receive a minimum of 50% of the required professional development hours dedicated to  language acquisition aligned to core content instruction, best practices for co-teaching strategies, and integrating language and  content instruction to all ELL's.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66            Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Annual individual meetings with parents of new students are held in the Spring.  ELL students who attended MS 67 last year,  will have a meeting scheduled in the fall to discuss the results of the NYSESLAT exam as well as placement for the Fall  classes.  The ELL teacher, the Assistant Principal, the content area teachers, and the Parent Coordinator are included in the  meeting.  Letters are sent (in English as well as in the child's home language) home notifying the parent of the date and time of  the scheduled meeting.  At the meeting, the child's progress is discussed in detail, and relevant data is explained as well.  Each  teacher will talk about the progress made in his/her subject area, language development needs and next steps for  improvement.  Our Parent Coordinator, Mrs. Cho is fluent in both Chinese and Korean.  Mrs. Choit, the Assistant Principal, is  fluent in Spanish.  If other languages are involved, the school will make sure an interpreter/translator is present/phone  conference.     2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.    MS 67 does offer monthly workshops to parents on pertinent issues/concerns at MS 67.  These include workshops such as  "Parent Orientation-Back to School Night", "Coffee and Conversation With the Principal"  "Navigating the High School  Application", "Citywide Behavioral Expectations", "Parents as Literacy Partners-Reading and Writing", "Organizational and  Study Skills for Parents and Students", "Preparing Your Child for the NYS ELA Exam", "Preparing Your Child For the NYS  Mathematics Exam", to name a few. The PTA also sponsors parent student activities such as ice-skating night and bowling  night, which helps to foster parent involvement.  ELL parents can take part in these activities.  Our parent coordinator, Ms. Cho  and Ms. Scoufaras, our ELL teacher, contacts parents about these workshops and activities and speaks to them in their native  language, encouraging them to be active participants.  Over the phone translations are available if needed.  Mrs. Choit, the  Assistant Principal, speaks fluent Spanish and our Parent Coordinator, Ms. Cho, is fluent in both Korean and Chinese.  They  attend the workshops to provide support to parents as well as translations, if needed.  If  more translators are needed, we will  hire them to come to our school for these workshops.  Documents distributed to the parents are in the native language of our  ELL population.           Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Louis Pasteur Middle School 67                                                                              School DBN: 26Q067  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Initial evaluation of translation and interpretation needs occurs when newly admitted students and their  parents/relatives are interviewed by the Assistant Principal during the registration process. At that time, if the  Home Language Survey indicates a language other than English, the parents/relatives are seen by our certified ELL  teacher who is responsible for all phases of the identification process. If it is determined from these interviews as  well as in Part 3 of the Home Language Survey, that translation and interpretation services are warranted, plans  are put into place in order to provide these services by pedagogical staff, relatives and friends,parent volunteers,  and translation service providers. Critical communications and documents are translated by the Department of  Education. Parents are given a copy of the Bill of Parent Rights and Responsibilities. They are also provided with  the address of the Department of Education website which gives information in each covered language regarding  translation and interpretation services and how to access these services. This all transpires well before the  required thirty days. Parents are required to complete blue cards every year and the required information is kept  in a file cabinet in alphabetical/class order in the main office. These cards can be accessed at any time. We can  also access the Preferred Language Report in ATS which tells us the parent's preferred language. This information   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70      is important to us. Our ELL teacher collects data through the Parent Survey which is given after the orientation  meeting.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.

From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu).
