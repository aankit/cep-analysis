The motivation driving this work is our commitment to providing every child with a school that  meets their academic and social-emotional needs. Closely accompanying this imperative is our belief that every school  can be renewed and foster a community based culture of learning. The job of the district is to use our position to  provide the systemic vision, strategies, and resources to facilitate school renewal through a collaborative effort including  all stakeholders.     The core values held as essential for the success of the School Renewal Program:     A “learning stance” must be held by all community members (district leaders, school leaders, school staff,   community-based partners, students and families). The work should be approached with humility and integrity.  We must all be willing learners.     A “theory of action” must guide the work to ensure clarity and coherence.    Authentic teams that collaborate in the spirit of trust, within and across the various levels of the school   community, are prerequisites for successful school renewal     Schools will be places of robust engagement, anchored in positive youth development, ensuring that the school   environment is welcoming and empowering for students, families and community members.     Strong professional development/learning is a fundamental part of our work.    The school renewal implementation must be simultaneously dynamic and responsive as well as sustained over   the three year period of renewal.     The organizing Theory of Action that guides the School Renewal Program strategy:   By using the Six Elements of the Framework for Great schools as our improvement structure, we seek to align  instructional coaching and leadership development with structural supports in order to build staff capacity.   Using schools  instructional foci, school leaders  and staff will implement changes  in curriculum,  instruction,  school  culture  and  structures  so  that  there  are  sustainable  improvements  in  student  outcomes  and  school  culture.     The arc of the School Renewal Program strategy:  In order to attain high levels of achievement for all students in Renewal  schools we must build capacity to increase  student achievement through the adoption of new attitudes and behaviors, research based strategies that improve  teacher practice, coupled with the use of clear data driven supports for building students’ skills in the content areas and  increasing student engagement. We are particularly prioritizing reading and writing across the curricula.  The use of  student learning data will drive instruction through strong teacher teams; onsite, job embedded professional learning  and problem solving, and accountability at all levels of the system:  central, district and school - for results. Renewal  schools are provided with intensive training, leadership and pedagogical coaching, and structural supports, monitoring  of implementation and ongoing feedback and revisions as needed. Further, each Renewal school will become a  Community School and strategically partner with community based organizations (CBO) to integrate social services and  expanded learning time into the fabric of the school to help them better serve the needs of students.  These schools will  stand as centers of opportunities where families can get the supports they need to make sure students come to school  ready and able to learn.    Structure of the Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP)   The Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP) will serve as the organizing and overarching document for  each Renewal school and will be directly aligned and developed around the elements of the Framework for Great  Schools, New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, and Strong Schools,  Strong Communities, including the following:     Demonstrable Improvement Benchmarks: Demonstrable improvement benchmarks located in the 2018-19   RSCEP, in the Data and Accountability Snapshot page.  Receivership benchmarks have been closely aligned with   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          5      the Renewal benchmarks so that schools will have one coherent set of improvement benchmarks to meet.  All  Receivership Benchmarks are a subset of Renewal Benchmarks. While the targets for these overlapping  benchmarks are not always identical, the Receivership Benchmark targets are always equal to or lower that the  Renewal Benchmarks targets. That means that any school that meets its Renewal Benchmarks targets have by  definition also met its Receivership Benchmarks targets. For additional information on Receivership  demonstrable improvement benchmarks go here.      Establishing an overarching summative vision aligned with elements of the Framework for Great Schools and   documenting key areas of celebration and renewal through analysis of assessments and by envisioning what the  desired outcome for each school will be at the end of the School Renewal process.      Setting interim assessment benchmarks that create the path for improvement by focusing on desired outcomes   and goals. In this way, the plan will be mapped to the overarching summative vision. In addition to the five  discrete goals formed around the elements of the Framework for Great Schools, each school will create an  action plan.     Transformation into a community school in order to increase student and family access to physical and mental   health services and other social-emotional supports made available in or near the school.     Expanded learning opportunities for all students, including additional instruction provided during afterschool      and/or summer programming provided in collaboration with community partners.  Intensive professional development for all staff to ensure effective implementation of curriculum and  instruction aligned to the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and to support staff in effectively responding  to the differentiated academic and social-emotional needs of all students.    Additional, focused strategies to increase parent and family engagement.      Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Information on the Framework for Great Schools and the DTSDE   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and RSCEP Development   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          6      The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive  Educational Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for  continuous improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing  review and analysis of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement  activities and strategies that improve outcomes for students.       Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.       The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          7     how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:   1.  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity  2.  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions  3.  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support  4.  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions  5.  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and  6.  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement    NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the RSCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the RSCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.     Next Steps for RSCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists in every Renewal school   and meets all the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the American Institute of Research (AIR) needs   assessment, the school’s updated NYSED accountability status and most current quantitative and qualitative  data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          8        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.       Step 4: Create a summative vision for the elements of the Framework for Great Schools.     Step 5: Revisit your school’s current goals, and strategically create new goals informed by the needs   assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART – Specific,  Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you monitor  progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you have identified, and will let your school  community know when you have reached your goal.       Step 6: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 7: Update your school’s AIS section. Title I schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement   Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 8: Complete the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) and the Community School sections.     Step 9: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether strategies and activities outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust practices along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          9      Section 3: Community Engagement Team and School Leadership Team (SLT) Signature Page       Directions: All SLT members are expected to sign this page to confirm their participation in the development of this  Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP).

Summarize the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) opportunities that have been offered to your students this year.   Bronx Collegiate Academy (B.C.A.) is one of six schools located on the Taft Educational Campus with an enrollment  that fluctuates near 400 students in grades 9 -12. The gender ratio is approximately 50% - 50%. The administrative  team consists of the principal and three assistant principals. The instructional team is staffed with 27 teachers and  five paraprofessionals. The students reside almost exclusively in the Bronx, and the Title 1 eligibility rate was 89%.  Currently, 28% of our students are English Language Learners, and 22% have Individualized Education Plans. Our  2017-2018 average daily attendance rate was 84.3% and our 4-year graduation rate is 85.7%   Spanish is the primary language of 82% of our ELL's. The remaining 18% are nearly exclusively from countries in  West Africa with varying dialects. Historical NYSESLAT data has shown that our ELL's have made steady progress  over time. 62% of our rising students have increased at least one level since attending BCA. To support our ELL's we  have three licensed ELL teachers and two assistant principals who were former ELL teachers. Our 9th and 10th  grade core course ELL sections are all co-taught with a content teacher and an ESL teacher. Both teachers are  equally responsible for planning and facilitating lessons. The overarching goal is to have our ELL's be able to thrive  in the upper grades without the same level of support that they received in the first two years.   To support our students with IEP's we have a staff that includes nine licensed Special Education teachers. Three  years ago we began our transition away from self contained classes. In year one we reduced self contained  instruction from all core classes to 9th and 10th grade English and Math. The following year we had self contained  classes only for 9th graders in Algebra and English. Last year we did not have any self contained classes. We feel  that introducing our students to the ICT model in earlier grades will best support higher expectations and standards  from both our students and staff. The success of our IEP students is best exhibited in our improved 4 year  graduation rate.. This year's graduation rate for students with IEP's reached an all time high (15/23 - 65%).   Current collaborations include a partnership with Counseling in Schools (CIS), New Settlement College Access  Center and The I Will Graduate Program (IWGP). CIS provides students and family support via social emotional and  mental health, family leadership training and attendance. New Settlement provides supplemental college  counseling, as they assist our seniors with application submission, financial aid, and post-graduation support. In  addition, New Settlement provides an instructor for an SAT prep class for our juniors, multiple college exposure  trips for all of our students and families, as well as a college readiness class for the students in our Scholar’s  Program. While the IWGP focuses on providing engaging programming for all students, while targeting our STH  population. Other collaborations include a teaching apprenticeship with the Teaching Fellows and Columbia  University Teachers College and a partnership with the Blue Engine Foundation to provide direct instructional  support to students.   Our strenghs are embedded in our tight-knit community as evidenced in our survey data and recruitment success.  We are most proud of the fact that staff, students and families all value our close-knit community. Even with the  hardships that are affiliated with sharing a campus amongst seven schools; B.C.A. students make the most of the  opportunities provided by the school. Glowing moments in the short history of B.C.A. include steady performance  increases culminating in rising graduation rates, selected Summer Search participants and a vastly improved course  offering which includes CUNY College Now, A.P.

Referencing the  Framework for Great Schools pillars, our strengths lie in our collaborative teaching model, our supportive  environment, effective leadership and overall trust.   The ultimate goal of the aforementioned Framework for Great schools is student achievement. To become a great  school, we need to make significant gains in major indicators such as graduation rate, average daily attendance,  Regents pass rates and student credit accumulation. We've made progress during recent years but our work is still  ahead of us. We have built strong relationships with a core base of parents but need to extend this base to include  a larger percentage of parents. Similarly with community initiatives, our goal is to develop additional relations and  to build our resources base.    With respect the the Framework areas in which we made great progress, supportive environment was our greatest  gain. We made great strides in supporting students’ social and emotional developmental health as evidenced by  our OORS incident data decreasing in incidents and suspensions; most impressive was the sharp reduction in  incidents that occurred during instruction. The concerted effort was fueled by a number of factors: more engaging  lessons, partnership with CIS, community building events and incentives, and a more proactive approach to student  affairs.   This year the key area of our DTSDE Tenet focus is curriculum development, support and planning. As evidence of  our ADVANCE data our work lies in providing support and development to staff in their planning and execution of  component 1e. This year we continue to implement multiple strategies to support planning. We fund substitute  teaches in order to allow content teachers to use the time for planning. This is scheduled once/month. Our peer  lesson review remain a large part of our professional development.                  2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          13         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 09X227   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   396   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   # Special Classes (ELA)  # Special Classes (Math)   # Visual Arts  # Foreign Language   % Title I Population  % Free Lunch  % Limited English Proficient   46  44   7  34   % American Indian or Alaska Native  % Hispanic or Latino  % White   # SETSS (ELA)  # SETSS (Math)  Types and Number of Special Classes (2018-19)  # Music  # Drama  # CTE  # Dance   19  20   1     # Integrated Collaborative Teaching (ELA)  # Integrated Collaborative Teaching (Math)   School Composition (2017-18)   85.0%  % Attendance Rate  84.8%  % Reduced Lunch  21.7%  % Students with Disabilities   Racial/Ethnic Origin (2017-18)   % Black or African American   0.0%  74.5%  % Asian or Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander  1.5%   % Multi-Racial   Personnel (2015-16)   Years Principal Assigned to School (2018-19)  % of Teachers with No Valid Teaching Certificate  % Teaching with Fewer Than 3 Years of Experience     0%  24%   # of Assistant Principals (2016-17)  % Teaching Out of Certification  Average Teacher Absences (2014-15)   Student Performance for Elementary and Middle Schools (2017-18)   ELA Performance at levels 3 & 4   Science Performance at levels 3 & 4 (4th Grade) (2016-17)   N/A   N/A   Mathematics Performance at levels 3 & 4  Science Performance at levels 3 & 4 (8th Grade) (2016- 17)   Student Performance for High Schools (2016-17)   ELA Performance at levels 3 & 4  Global History Performance at levels 3 & 4  4 Year Graduation Rate   Regents Diploma w/ Advanced Designation   65%  63%  63.4%   4.3%   Mathematics Performance at levels 3 & 4  US History Performance at Levels 3 & 4  6 Year Graduation Rate (2011 Cohort)  % ELA/Math Aspirational Performance Measures  (2015-16)   Reward  In Good Standing  Focus District   Priority School   Overall NYSED Accountability Status (2018-19)   No  No  Yes   Recognition  Local Assistance Plan  Focus School Identified by a Focus District   No   Focus Subgroups   -

Needs:      In our 2017 Quality School guide, the average passing scores of our Regents exams for Algebra and English  were both 63. This number is two points below the passing mark and substantially below the college  readiness threshold.     Although we received scores of proficient for each of the three instructional indicators on the quality review   in both 2017 and 2018, curriculum and assessment respectively were cited as our areas focus.  Improved vertical alignment within curricular areas.

Aug 27th - Aug 31st Blue Engine will host  a 5 part planning series for 9th grade Algebra and English teachers. The major foci of the training will be using data to  inform planning and instruction as well as maximizing the efficiency/effectiveness of collaborative instructional  teams. The majority of the teaching staff will attend QTEL training. The QTEL program provides quality teaching  strategies for supporting ELLs. Every data source that we utilize (Grad rate, attendance, Regents passing, college  readiness, etc..) highlight that our most challenged sub group are ELL's.    Our multi-tiered planning series includes a three day/week co-planning schedule. At least twice a semester each  teacher (teaching pair) will be covered for the day and they will plan units and lessons with a district content coach  and oversight by an administrator.               Part 2 – Summative Vision for Rigorous Instruction   What is your school’s instructional focus? What is your vision for promoting the instructional focus consistently across  classrooms?    Instructional Focus:   If teachers develop rigorous, student-centered, Regents aligned tasks and provide timely feedback, then students will  improve their reading, writing and critical thinking skills across all content areas.     BCA has opted into the Collections ELA curriculum which serves as the foundation for our curriculum and is  supplemented by a variety of other resources and literature. For math we use NYEngage as the foundation and  supplement with various resources. We use the DOE frameworks and New Visions Curriculum for science and social  studies. Teachers will use June data to revise curricula for the 18-19 school year. During this process, teachers will  also incorporate strategies and activities that will scaffold for ELLs and SWDs, such as using chunked and modified   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          17      texts, choosing appropriate visual aids to support texts, and providing complex and compound sentence frames with  relation to different conversation structures (i.e., cause and effect, comparison, sequencing, etc). Moreover, teachers  will also modify units within curricula to enhance rigor for higher-achieving students; these modifications include  adding additional texts from different perspectives and modifying tasks to involve more synthesis. To enhance  school-wide writing, teachers will use TEXAS writing techniques and a uniform annotating approach. While writing  units for the content, teachers will also implement an end of the unit performance task to analyze student work and  show growth over time. For example, at the end of every Social Studies unit, students will write a thematic essay that  is parallel to what was taught in the unit.       In addition to the core curricula, AP and college courses will be taught using college syllabi assessments that will also  reflect the types of tasks and questions with which students will be confronted on the actual exams. To improve  students’ performance in these classes, vertical planning will exist among the teachers who instruct students in the  Scholars Program, so that when these students enter AP and college courses, they are prepared for the extensively  challenging work. In an effort to improve student engagement, the mode of instruction will include technology, as  well as incorporating student interest into coursework by surveying students prior to designing specific lessons.  Hence, evidence of instructional shifts will be evident as teacher-centered, single-mode courses will no longer exist at  BCA.    The extended learning time that will occur during the Renewal hour will be pivotal to our success; by folding our  Renewal hour into the day, students will be automatically programmed for electives and enrichment opportunities  based on their data and interests. For example, students were given a choice form that listed elective classes they  would be interested in taking for the upcoming school year. In addition, if data shows that a student is performing on  a lower reading level, they will be scheduled for either Rewards or Wilson Reading Programs. Also, on-track students’  enrichment offerings will include electives that are similar to college-level courses, such as psychology and statistics.  Our 7 SEAS program will provide enrichment to the students who are in need of not only academic interventions but  social emotional assistance as well. While the 7SEAS courses are aligned to content areas instruction, an additional  counseling component is included in the curricula. In order to ensure that the ELT courses are aligned with the school- day courses, all teachers and CBO facilitators must participate in professional development and plan coursework that  is reflective of the school’s instructional focus. Also, since coursework must be revised to reflect data trends, teachers  will work collaboratively to revise curricula accordingly. Administrators and teacher leaders will provide feedback to  teachers and facilitators based on the group’s work products and observations. All assessments will be aligned to the  CCSS; for courses that are preparing students for Regents examinations, the assessments will be similar to said  exams, while enrichment courses will mimic the structure of college-level assessments. All students will participate in  interim assessments three times a year, and the assessments will be graded, disaggregated by different subgroups  and analyzed by teacher teams.                         What is your vision for the implementation of CCLS-aligned curricula that meets the needs of your diverse learners,  personally, academically, and culturally?      2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          18      Teachers will provide culturally relevant and diverse texts, assignments with choice where students can  independently demonstrate their learning, and plan academically rigorous lessons and unit plans that contain  appropriate modifications, targeted resources, and adequate scaffolding.             What is your vision for diverse program offerings that allow students to develop skills, habits, and behaviors to be  career and college ready? How are instructional shifts embedded in this vision?  The school will offer a range of programs for diverse learners, including accelerated courses (Advanced Placement,  College accredited, SAT Prep, and Honors), remediation (Apex, 7 Seas, Rewards and Wilson Reading Programs),  electives (Creative Writing, Foreign Language, Public Speaking, Music, Dance), and trade classes (Co-Op Tech,  Cooking,and internships ).          What do you envision the delivery of instruction to look like so that all students are set up for success?      Teachers will plan lessons that are student-centered, providing opportunities for student voice within the classrooms,  and provide sufficient time for students to independently engage with the material and work with the task at hand,  as well as allow them to work in hetero and homogeneous groupings, while consistently providing them with an  ample amount of support materials.            How do you envision teachers using multiple entry points to ensure the success of every child?  Teachers will gear lessons toward multiple learning modalities to provide students with multiple entry points to  access information, through visuals, hands-on activities, kinesthetic activities, auditory and verbal instructional  deliveries.         What is your vision for the use of a comprehensive assessment strategy (diagnostic, formative, benchmark, and  summative) to drive curricular, instructional, and organizational decisions that impact student outcomes?     Teachers will implement formative assessments in every lesson, benchmark, pre-assessments, mid-unit assessments,  and summative assessments in every unit, and will use the data to drive further instruction.          Please indicate below the specific assessments that you are implementing and their purpose for each grade.

What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide,   Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review?      The most recent quality review and survey environment data support our belief that the school culture is one in  which students feel safe, supported and challenged. In our April 2017 Quality Review, school culture continued to be  one or our strength for it received a rating of well developed. On the environment survey, over 87% of the students  responded that they felt safe at school. Our success is primarily attributed to our commitment to create an  environment in which students feel supported and welcome. Both financial and time resources are invested in extra- curricular activities, student-driven events and performance incentives. Our priority need is to evolve into a  community in which students are allowed to play a greater role in the decision making, including disciplinary policies,  conflict mediation and budgeting. Our partnership with our CBO, Counseling in Schools has added another layer of  support for our students. They are fully invested in the culture and mission of the school and are looked upon as BCA  staff as opposed to 'the partnering group.'

Most specifically, we want to make staff aware of students/families who are in immediate  crisis. Students in the two major sub groups (IEP and ENL) will be the primary subjects of the interventions.   ● CBO broadening their scope to be more inclusive of the neighboring community. This 'need' was derived from a  survey given to the staff during our May 2018 Community Forum. Additionally, this need was cited during our end of  year reflection conversation with the Director of Community Schools.           Part 2 – Summative Vision for Supportive Environment   What is your vision for a supportive school environment? How will you in partnership with each CBO and families  enact your vision?     We would like BCA to become a hub for our community which has historically been underserved and plagued by  poverty related hardships. Services will include but not be limited to: guidance on housing referrals, English Language  acquisition, mental and physical health, employment opportunities, immigration and legal services and job  placement. Our primary CBO partner, Counseling in Schools, will collaborate and partner with other organizations and  schools to bring these services to the community.       For our students, CIS will continue to support our 7 SEAS ELT program which targets at-risk students in grades 10-12.  They will partner with instructional staff in these small advisory groups to provide both academic and emotional  support. CIS will support our high-achieving students by increasing our A.P. class offerings in addition to other  electives such as SAT Prep and College Now. Counseling in Schools will provide multi-tiered support to families of  students who are chronically absent or long-term absences by creating yearly social-emotional goals for students on  each grade level. CIS will also offer creative therapy to students, as well as push into classes and meet with students  both before and after school. By meeting with school stakeholders regularly, CIS will report the impact of their efforts  and continue to revise their action plans in order to help the school meet their goal. The efficacy of the social- emotional programs will be measured by attendance, credit accumulation, reduction in OORS incidents, and family  involvement at key events, such as parent-teacher conferences and college nights. CIS will also assist in the  developing and engaging parents on the first BCA Parent Councils to strengthen the relationship with parents.          2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          26   Who are your CBO partners?

BCA needs to develop a series of consistent formative assessment practices that can be utilized across grade levels  and subject areas. Currently, as a school we have two strong structures in place; accountable talk and WITsi  strategies. In addition to developing more robust structures across disciplines and grades we will work on pedagogical  skills that will allow us to use these checks for understanding as leverage points during the lesson and make  instructional shifts as dictated by the data.               Part 2 – Summative Vision for Collaborative Teachers   What is your vision for collaborative teaching?           BCA continues to incorporate teacher collaboration on a daily basis; the faculty continue to meet in grade teams,  departments, and interdisciplinary visitation groups. The priority still remains in co-teachers having planning time  together and equal ownership in the classroom. Dedicating three days each week for structured meetings and two  professional periods for co-teachers and grade teams to meet during this time allows for cohesion and and dynamic  instruction across classrooms. The investment developed in our inter-visitation cycles where we use the tuning  protocol to assess lesson plans, observe the presenting teacher, and provide low inference data and clear next steps,  based on Danielson’s Framework continues to assist teachers in developing lessons that provide rigor and student  engagement. The analysis of student work in order to assess students across the skill spectrum and identify their  strengths and weaknesses remains a component that drives lesson development and instruction. The administration  provides planning time by department so teachers can continue to benefit from the conversations with other  teachers of their subjects and are given real time to develop and enhance Year Long Plans, Unit Plans, and Lesson  Plans. Our weekly Professional Development meetings also serve as a main forum for teachers to hear each others  voices and learn new strategies; teachers themselves typically lead the PD’s and often showcase and engage with  other teachers about their own best practices, and to continually bring ideas to each other.   Our philosophy is that thinking must be visible and student engagement must be central to all planning. We are  aiming to improve and modify our focus on student voice and opinion to ensure student engagement. Our 7 SEAS  program has been developed so that the needs of our lowest 3rd can be addressed and the classes such as AP  European History, AP United States History, AP Literature, Physics, Psychology, SAT Prep, and College Now are still a  part of our Curriculum so that our more advanced students can remain challenged academically. Our connections and  relationship with outside programs that provide our students with internships, summer programs, and college classes  are still intact and are actually expanding. We are entering the third year of BCA scholars program where we offer  advanced tracks for students who are highly motivated. The culture of BCA is extremely safe as evident by parent and  student surveys as we share common understanding, thanks in large to professional development meetings with our  guidance team, on the protocols for dealing with bullying, confrontation, and we rarely have these problems because  of this unified vision. Teachers use data from the inter visitation low inference notes, interim assessments, research  projects, essays, and informal questioning to zero in on individual students and their needs. Teachers will also team  with community partners to support this work by providing and/or financing students with internships, vocational   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          32           training programs, increased clubs and sports, college trips, guest speakers, staff development and education related  opportunities that can strengthen practice.

A clear system of communication and collaboration between instructional staff and Administration to maximize the  available resources to assist co-teachers in carrying out the school’s vision for collaborative teaching and improving  student learning.             How do you envision collaboration within teacher teams to improve teacher practices and student learning?

Collaboration in the creation and modification of unit plans, lesson plans, and materials will  ensure increased modifications for IEP and ELL students.Teachers will also teams will communicate with each other on a  weekly basis for lesson planning and check-in with each other daily on the implementation of the instructional goals         How do you envision collaboration across teacher teams to improve teacher practices and student learning?      Team leaders plan professional development and debrief together to make necessary adjustments and ultimately to  increase focus on establishing common practices and tasks that push student learning. The team leaders should share a  common goal and direction as per the recommendations of the school's leadership team. To facilitate this  communication and vision, each marking period a multi-disciplinary team meeting will be held to ensure that common  instructional practices are being implemented. In addition, teachers will reflect using data tools to ensure that the  teams are on track for meeting full alignment of curriculum.      What data will teachers and the School Instructional Cabinet regularly review to ensure that they are reflecting upon  their teaching practices and meeting individual student learning needs?  What is the intent for reviewing each piece of  data? (ex. Teachers will regularly review student IEPs when developing lessons in order to ensure that tasks are  appropriately scaffolded.)

Part 2 – Summative Vision for Effective School Leadership   What is your vision for effective school leadership at your school?         Having an administrative team of four, we have been able to sustain the structures that are currently in place and  offer more support to our ENL and SWD departments which has shown growth in Danielson Components 3c and 3d.  We must prioritize that observations and feedback are done in a consistent and timely matter. This summer we will  create the observation schedule and tracker that begins with a week of ‘observation norming’ in September to ensure  that we give staff consistent and actionable feedback. Our administrative team will meet bi-weekly to discuss  observational information and trends in our practice, particularly those that are highlighted during our professional  learning series.       Our distributed leadership structure supports a shared accountability model. One of our strengths is the sharing of  data, trends and information with all community constituents. Benchmarks and progress will be highlighted and  revisited on a continuous basis. Structures that are currently in place include weekly attendance team meetings,  department leader meetings, department team meetings, Inquiry teams, leadership team meetings and SBST  meetings.            On which aspects of your own leadership do you plan to focus for the upcoming school year?  Providing timely feedback and support to teachers specifically in the area of Danielson 1E.

How will you utilize teacher  leaders to build broad capacity within your school?      Teacher leaders are utilized in our school in different capacities. Teacher leaders take on roles of professional  development to their colleagues, mentoring new teachers, and open classroom visitations. Teachers take on  leadership roles in different meetings throughout the school. For example, department leaders and grade teams are  led by teachers. Guidance counselors lead meetings such as SBST and the attendance team.             How will the leader foster collaborative school governance processes, and ensure full family participation together  with other stakeholders?  PA and SLT meeting are held monthly.

What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide,   Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review?   This year we reached an attendance rate of 84%. We will continue to conduct outreach in order to reduce the number  of chronic absentee students and to combat truancy. We will use an inquiry approach to identify and create  interventions for both historical absentee patterns (around the holiday season) and within targeted groups. We will  collaborate with our community based organization, Counseling in Schools, to create targeted interventions for this  population. The strength of the school is the consistent weekly attendance tracking and daily outreach when students  are not in school as well as the Success Mentor Program we began in the Spring of 2016. According to the quality  review, BCA has "established a culture for learning that communicates high expectations to staff, students. and  families, and provide supports to achieve those expectations." In addition, for the 2018-2019 school year BCA will  focus on increasing communication with families, building community with parents, supporting families and ensuring  the parents are welcomed and engaged in the school.    Strengths:     Provide pupilpath for families and students to access grades and attendance records      The school has established effective and targeted outreach around a set of high expectations that involves the   Strong partnership with community based organization, Counseling in Schools   support of families     Communication structures to both parents and students ensure that families have real time information   around student progress, the college process, and attendance    2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          45           Effective feedback and guidance/advisement supports ensure that students, including high needs subgroups,   own their educational experience and are prepared for the next level      Areas of Improvement     Parents and students do not receive satisfactory training in effectively using the pupilpath program    Provide parents with data regarding their student’s progress in a way that is accessible and useful    Continue to provide alternative post secondary training program and pathway options for non-college bound   students     While the school has conducted some workshops for parents on various topics, there is no formal, written   plan for promoting and providing training to parents on how parents can support student success in academic  and social and emotional developmental health.     Part 2 – Summative Vision for Strong Family and Community Ties   What is your vision for having strong family and community ties at your school?   In our vision for having strong family and community ties we see reciprocal communication where families feel  empowered to discuss their student's progress through the use of data. Parents can expect monthly mailings and emails  with updated calendars, Counseling in Schools news and community resources available for our families.         Within the Community School model, how will families be welcomed into the school and made a part of the school  community?  What support will administrators, teachers, school staff and school safety officers be given to help create  a welcoming environment?   Will there be a dedicated space for families in the school?    Families will be welcomed into our school by being greeted in the office by our bilingual staff as well as our Americorp  Parent Engagement Specialist. Informative pamphlets will be placed in the Parent Waiting Area for parents to review at  their leisure. School Safety Agents will be trained to properly greet our parents and call one of our staff members to  meet parents at the main entrance to escort them to the main office. During scheduled events, BCA student  Ambassadors will meet and greet our families. In order to ensure our families understand and can take an active role in  what their child is learning, our CBO will conduct workshops throughout the year to review high school graduation  criteria, Common Core curriculum and expectations and strategies to help their children at home. Through the 7 SEAS  program teachers will work collaboratively with the CBO to ensure communication between parents and teachers  regarding students’ social, emotional and academic progress. Parents and families will have a parent kiosk in room 253  with access to their child’s performance data, information on upcoming events and opportunities to participate in the  school community.          How will the school identify and develop families to take leadership roles in school decision making/school  governance structures?  BCA will identify and develop families to take leadership roles in the school thorough a Community Forum where  parents and students address all teachers to communicate their needs. To this end, teachers and staff will have a clear  plan of action on how to meet the community needs most effectively. Additionally, families will complete periodic  surveys to further inform our school of the direction in which we need to direct our support and resources. Finally,  parents will continue to be provided with BCA email addresses to enable quick and easy contact to the members of our  school community.      2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          46          How will the school engage the community and families? How will they ensure that teachers are able to learn from  families about the children being taught?  The data gathered from our periodic surveys will provide our teachers with useful information about the children they  are teaching. In addition to the formal conversations that our teachers and parents will have during parent teacher  conferences, there will be community events that will provide a forum for informal conversations to develop between  all stakeholders.

ELT provides enriching  educational experiences that happen outside of the traditional school day and blend skill acquisition, relationship- building and fun to foster academic and social-emotional growth. Summer learning, afterschool programming, and  extended-day ELT models, when well-implemented, play a critical role in supporting students in all grades and ensuring  that they graduate from high school, college and career ready. SED requires that Priority schools offer a minimum of 200  additional student contact hours as Expanded Learning Time in addition to the current mandated length of 900 hours of  instruction per year (25 hours per week) in grades K-6 and 990 hours of instruction per year (27.5 hours per week) in  grades 7-12. Effective ELT models will blend school staff with community partners, and will provide a balanced  curriculum that can include ELA, math, STEM, arts, physical activity, and leadership development. Complete the sections  on this page to demonstrate how the school will meet these requirements.     Part 1 – ELT Program Goal(s)   Describe the summative goal(s) of the ELT program for the 2018-19 school year. Goals for ELT should align to the  Renewal Benchmarks.  How will the school will ensure that all students’ individual needs are served during the  Renewal ELT and how the school’s vision for ELT will impact both academic achievement and social emotional  growth? Be sure to construct the goal to be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.    Goals:   1. By August 2019 45% of 2nd and 3rd year students will meet the criteria for progress towards graduation as  established by the Renewal program.   2. By August 2019 70% of '7 SEAS' program students will earn a minimum of 10 credits.         Part 2 – ELT Program Type   Is the ELT program voluntary or compulsory?      Voluntary   X   Compulsory   Renewal ELT – Describe what accountability structures the school will employ to ensure participation of all students,  including special populations, will participate fully in Renewal ELT.  Additional ELT - If there is a voluntary ELT program in addition to the compulsory Renewal ELT, indicate how you will  actively encourage the participation of all students, with the goal of serving at least 50% of students.  Our ELT program is compulsory; students will be assigned to the various programs based on their social, emotional,  and academic needs. All will be strongly encouraged to actively participate in the Extended Learning Time  programs. Letters will be sent to all homes in parent’s native language informing them of the benefits of the  program to extend an invitation for all students to participate. Additionally, frequent telephone calls will be made  to parents/guardian reminding them of these classes. When students are absent - teachers, staff from both the  CBO and BCA will call parents to inform them of their child’s non-participation. Guidance counselor will conduct  frequent student conferences to discuss their credit accumulation and academic progress and to identify next steps  to meet the graduation requirements.         Part 3 – ELT Program Description   Target Population: The ELT program for a Renewal School will be offered to all students in the school.   Describe how the school will meet the following SED requirements for an ELT program:  How will the school integrate academics, enrichment, and skill development through hands-on experiences that make  learning relevant and engaging?    How will CBO staff and the school’s teachers be integrated to provide a seamless learning day?   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          53        Offer a range of activities that capture student interest and strengthen student engagement in learning so as   to promote higher attendance, reduces risk for retention or drop out, and increases the likelihood of  graduation.     Actively address the unique learning needs and interests of all types of students, especially those who may   benefit from approaches and experiences not offered in the traditional classroom setting.     What new content areas and opportunities will be offered to students? How will the school ensure all IEP and   language mandates are met during ELT?     Contain components designed to improve student academic, social, and emotional outcomes, including   opportunities for enrichment programs such as in music and art.     Ensure instruction in any core academic subject offered in the program will be delivered under the   supervision of a teacher who is NYS certified in that particular content area.     How will community educators receive professional development?  Are there plans to provide joint PD to   school faculty and community partner staff?     What content will be led by pedagogical staff and what content will be led by CBO partners?    How will the school best utilize CBO partners to impact student achievement?    How will effective outreach be conducted to families?    How will programming be made easily accessible to students and families in order to encourage   participation?      The ELT program at BCA will consists of the following components: 7 SEAS Program (Social, Emotional and  Academic Support), The Wilson Reading Program, Rewards Program, Internship Program and after school  enrichment programs.    7 SEAS Program   The 7 SEAS is a multi-tiered, credit-bearing program designed to support the needs of targeted 10th, 11th and 12th  grade BCA students. Selection criteria will be based on attendance (60 – 90% average daily attendance rate),  student performance (Regents and credits) and anecdotal data (behavior and social emotional support needs.)  These students may include but certainly are not limited to students in the three major sub groups: English  Language Learners, IEP students and students in the lowest third. Homogeneous class groupings will be scheduled  throughout the program. Staff members leading the 7 SEAS program will be working with a small group of students  (12-14) helping to meet the specific needs of the group, including keeping track of student progress, attendance,  and specific targeted interventions as identified by student data. Teachers will be assigned to a 7 SEAS section  based on their licensed content area. Frequent, open, and active communication between teachers, parents, and  students provides an airtight support system for student success. Adults convey high expectations, individual  affirmation and support, and genuine caring to all members of their group. Our CBO—Counseling in Schools will  also help support the program by providing guest speakers, resources, and leading appropriate events for small  groups. 7 SEAS is an apt metaphor for our community because our students come from various nations and  cultures but identify as being part of one community. Each group will ‘brand’ itself and develop a sense of pride  and identity. Seven small groups composed of twelve to fourteen students, two teachers and a student worker. It is  important that the classes be kept small in order to ensure that each student receives both the personalized  attention necessary to make significant progress in addition to the support of the peer group. Pedagogues will  work together to plan, facilitate, support and conference with students, families and staff. Each month all groups  will work on specific themes and present to all students in the program during our 7 SEAS Luncheons. Each course  will have a different academic focus that is created and facilitated by the teachers. Students participating in the 7  SEAS program will spend three days on academically focused course content two days on enrichment activities  focused on the social emotional support the students are receiving. Some enrichment resources will be provided  for teachers to use at their discretion. Monthly/Bi-Monthly (depending on the schedule and budget) outings to  build community among all 7 SEAS students. Parents of 7 SEAS students will be engaged via the annual 7 SEAS  Brunch or other parent activities geared toward providing parents the tools to support their children. Teachers   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          54      provide weekly feedback on student progress. Each student will create SMART goals; teachers will help keep  students on track by providing regular, actionable feedback; helping students reach their goals.    Wilson Reading and the Rewards Program will be offered as 7 SEAS sections. Students will be placed in these  classes based on assessments such as the Gates McGinite.      Reading Plus   Reading Plus is a program designed to improve the reading abilities of students from Kindergarten through 12th  grade. The program has three components: iBalance, SeeReader, and ReadAround. iBalance trains the students  brains and eyes to read fluently when silently reading and also to see more characters on the page at a time.  SeeReader is the comprehension component of the program. Students get to choose a text (either fiction or  nonfiction) at their reading level. They then read the story and answer ten comprehension questions. ReadAround  gives students the opportunity to work with common grade level vocabulary words. They are asked to select the  definition of the words and sentences where the word is used correctly. If the student struggles with a word, it is  marked as a “Word in Progress,” and the student sees the word again at a later time. Otherwise, the word is  marked as “Mastered.” At the beginning of the school year, students complete an online baseline assessment  through Reading Plus. This assessment is used to measure the students reading comprehension level, reading rate,  and vocabulary level. The program then places the students at the appropriate SeeReader and ReadAround levels  and determines whether or not students need to participate in the iBalance component (depending on their  reading rates).      Frequency of Program   In this course, students work with the Reading Plus program three days a week. In the past, students worked with  the program only two days a week, but it was determined by the staff and administration that two days a week  was not providing the students with a sufficient amount of time to truly benefit from the program. On each  Reading Plus day, students work with all three components (unless the program has decided that a student does  not need iBalance), and then the students work in small groups based on a specific reading skill that they need to  improve. These skills are determined by reading the data reports provided by the Reading Plus program.      Data Days   On the first Reading Plus day of each month, the students are provided with their individual “Instructional  Summary Reports”. This report shows the students the progress they have made in each of the three components  of Reading Plus. Additionally, it shows the students their performances in regards to nine reading skills. Each skill  has a percentage next to it that represents the number of SeeReader questions related to that skill that the student  answered correctly. Students are asked to reflect on both their highest and lowest skills and why they think each  skill is either higher or lowest. Students are then put into groups of four to five students based on their lowest skill  (or second lowest skill if necessary for grouping). These are the groups that the students work in for the remainder  of the month.   Small Group Skill Work   On each Reading Plus day after students have completed the three online components of the program, they work  in small group on their lowest skill. There are a variety of activities for students to do in these small groups:   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          55     At the beginning of the month, groups work on skill worksheets provided as an additional offline resource  by Reading Plus. These worksheets are scaffolded by reading level and provide students with basic practice  related to their skills. Students complete worksheets within two or three levels of their SeeReader levels. If  they are working above their SeeReader levels, they use the support of their group members to help them  comprehend and complete the worksheet. By the end of the first week, each group is required to provide  an explanation of their specific skill in their own words.  Students are also be provided with short stories or short informational texts, and then are asked to work as  a group to apply their specific reading skill to these texts. These texts are related to what they students are  covering in their ELA, history, and science classes. These texts are scaffolded according to reading level of  the students.        At the end of the month, students work together to prepare a five minute presentation about their skill. In   this presentation, students define their skill and provide an example of how to apply it to a text.     Additionally, one day a week each small group works with the teacher. This provides the teacher with an   opportunity to answer any questions the students may have about their skill that they have not had a  chance to ask at other times during the week. This is also the time that the teacher uses additional reading  intervention strategies with the group according to the needs of the students. These needs are determined  by data from reading plus, formal and informal observations of the students’ small group work, and written  assignments.         Presentations and Awards Days   On the final Reading Plus day of each month, the small groups give the presentations they have prepared on each  of their skills. The teacher then gives out awards for the month. The biggest award is given to the group that has  had the greatest overall average improvement in their specific skill percentage. Additional awards are also given to  students who have moved up a level in either SeeReader or ReadAround, students who have made significant gains  in their words per minute reading rate, and students who have been committed to the program and have worked  on Reading Plus outside of class time. (Additional awards are given if the teacher deems appropriate or necessary.)      Book Clubs (Literature Circles)   Selection of Books   Book choices are selected by the teacher. The majority of the book club cycles have selections related to the unit of  the Collections curriculum that students are studying in their ELA classes. Some cycles have selections related to  the historical time period that is being studied in the students’ global history courses.   Students are given an opportunity at the beginning of each cycle to explore each of the books available and then to  rate them by interest. The teacher then puts students into groups of four or five students based on their ratings of  books (also taking into consideration how well certain personalities work together).   Frequency and Format of Book Club Days   Two days per week are designated as Book Club days. Each of these days consists of three parts:   Mini-lesson led by the teacher (5-15 minutes)   1.  Book Clubs meet in small groups (20-30 minutes)  2.  Reflection on small group meetings (5-10 minutes)   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          56            Mini-lessons   Each Book Club day, the teacher begins the class with a short mini-lesson. These mini-lessons are used as a time to  assist students with skills that the teacher has observed students are struggling with in their Book Club meetings  (either an academic skill or a discussion skill). If students seem to be doing generally well overall, the mini-lessons  are used as a time to provide students with tools to enhance their discussions and to challenge them to think in  different ways. These mini-lessons may come from Mini-Lessons for Literature Circles by Daniel and Steineke or  from a variety of other resources, or the teacher may develop a mini-lesson specific to the class. All mini-lessons  are adapted to the specific needs of each particular class.   Small Group Responsibilities   Each small group is in charge of running its own Book Club. The following are a list of responsibilities that each  group is accountable for over the course of a Book Club cycle:     Develop a reading calendar    Complete assigned readings (as assigned by group)    Develop discussion questions and topics      Remain on task during group meetings    Complete any written assignments    Prepare a group presentation when finished with the book   Include all members of the group in discussions   Teacher Role during Book Club Meetings   The teacher acts only as a facilitator during Book Club meetings. The teacher sets the students up to work in their  groups and may give them something to focus on during their discussions based on the mini-lesson. However, the  teacher does not contribute to the conversations happening within groups. The teacher circulates throughout the  room and takes observational notes on what is happening within the small group discussions. These notes are used  to inform the teacher’s mini-lessons and to help the teacher to determine if she needs to have any one-on-one  conferences with students.    Incorporating Reading Plus and Other Content Areas   In addition to the regular during reading activities that students are responsible for in Book Club, the teacher will  also frequently ask students to apply their Reading Plus skills to the books that they are reading. This gives  students additional opportunities to consider their skills and also allows them to share their skills with members of  their group, who are very likely in different Reading Plus skill groups.   Furthermore, the teacher encourages the Book Club groups to frequently reflect on and discuss how their book  relates to the unit being studied in either ELA or global. There is a short written assignment in each Book Club cycle  that asks students to explain the connection between their books and either their ELA or global unit of study.   Reflection      At the end of each Book Club day, students are given an opportunity to reflect on their meeting for that day. These  reflections are facilitated in a variety of ways, including questionnaires, journaling, goal setting, etc. These   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          57      reflections provide students with an opportunity to consider both how they worked individually within the group  and how the group worked together as a whole. These reflections are also used to inform the teacher of what  students may need in future mini-lessons.      The credit accumulation component of the Extended Learning Time program will allow students to continue their  progress towards graduation in a small setting with a certified subject area teacher in collaboration with  Counseling in Schools. Students will receive individualized attention where their academic needs are met so as to  enhance their possibilities for academic success. English Language Learners and SWD’s will be offered an intensive  language/literacy development workshops/classes and programs through Wilson Reading and Reading Plus to  enhance their targeted language (English) skills and also assist them in making Annual Yearly Progress. For on track  11th and 12th grade students BCA along with Counseling in Schools (CBO) will assist in establishing professional  internships in order to continue developing their career readiness skills.

Monthly meetings and Community  School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this  family  engagement strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work.  Renewal School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director,  select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual  students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use.  Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work.   Counseling in Schools provides the school with a full-time Community Director. Additionally, Counseling in Schools  provides an Internship Coordinator and Attendance Coordinator, as well as mentors and social workers to support  the Community School Program at BCA. The main focus of their work is to support the school in increasing  attendance, particularly for hard to reach students and families. The Community Director works closely with the  Principal, Parent Coordinator, Support Services Team and SLT teams to identify gaps of support for families. After  identifying these gaps, the Community Director ensures that whatever services Counseling in Schools has agreed to  provide will be executed with fidelity and in line with BCA’s instructional focus. One area that the school has  already identified as a need is a skilled clinician to support with home-visits to the target population of students  with low attendance. In the 2017-18 School Year, the Community Director did not conduct any home visits and that  is an area of focus fr 2018-19. An intervention plan was shared with the Support Services Team and the Principal  after each home visit. This plan is being monitored by the Attendance Liaison in collaboration with the Community  Director and the Support Services Team.   In June , the Community Director met with the school’s admin team, CIS Director, Office of Community Schools  manager, and the Mental Health director to continue developing Intervention Plans for at-risk students, as  identified from data gathered in the 2017-18 School Year. The school will continue in the 2018-2019 school year  with Intervention Plans in place for targeted students. This way, plans are not being developed in September, but  implemented and monitored for impact. The Community Director will work with the Parent Coordinator over the  summer to conduct home visits for students on Intervention Plans. These Intervention Plans will be shared with  staff, students and families during the first month of school. These plans will include:    ● a point person for each student   ● student goals around attendance, academics, and behavior   ● input from students, families and teachers on how the student learns best   ● weekly incentives for meeting goals   ● linkages for the student’s family as identified during home visits   ● daily check-ins with the student   ● weekly progress monitoring   ● frequent family meetings    The Community Director is a key participant in weekly Attendance Team meetings, SLT meetings, Support Services  meetings, and SIT team meetings. The Community Director will be a central hub to connect families to mental  health, housing and other resources.       2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          61      The Internship Coordinator provided by Counseling in Schools oversees an Internship Program for on-track juniors  and seniors to gain real-world experiences. The Community Director works over the summer to continue creating  contacts for the Internship Program. The Internship Coordinator identifies businesses or programs where juniors  and seniors could gain workplace experience. The Internship Coordinator’s responsibility is to connect students  with and manage the Internship Program, ensuring that both businesses and students are having a productive  experience that will prepare students for the workplace.    In addition to the support services outlined in section 6, Counseling in Schools will support our existing programs  such a Cosmetology and band.    In collaboration with the Parent Coordinator, the Community Director will hold monthly workshops with families  around topics identified in the interest survey, as well as from data gathered from home visits.

Name and describe the scope of involvement of all community partners working in the school (include partners   supporting ELT, counseling, enrichment, etc.)   2.  Name the members of your Community School Team and how meetings will be organized and structured to   engage all stakeholders and be focused on results.   3.  Explain data strategies including the use of the data sorter, and steps that the school will take to ensure that the   appropriate interventions are provided to the right students   The Community Director in collaboration with the Principal, Assistant Principals and Director of School Renewal  will oversee the implementation of the Community School program and is responsible for monitoring the progress  of the program. Because the Community School program is a true collaboration among all stakeholders, the school  social worker, guidance team, culture team, teachers, students and families will all be involved in program  implementation.       The Community School Program is evaluated by the impact it has to raise credit accumulation, decrease chronic  absenteeism and raise overall attendance rates.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (RSCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          71      amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          72       2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/RSCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          73      Section 11: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)        (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. 09X227, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Bronx Collegiate Academy will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          74      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

This academic year we have launched a new initiative aimed at improving ELLs’  academic achievement, which involves working closely with their parents. First, BCA will host a  regular ELLs’ Parent Night every other month meeting with a focus focuses on all ELL students  (Club L and CASA) and their specific needs and supports. Topics such as reading, essential tools  for school, academic success and acculturation will be covered at these meetings. CIS which is  our CBO will provide workshops and present materials for parents in a biliingual setting.  Second, our school-wide inquiry project for this year is focusing on ELLs, including a teacher- student mentoring program, about which parents will be kept up-to-date on their child’s  performance in school. Our data has shown a decline in academic performance during their 11     th     and 12    th     grade years. Therefore, this year  we targeting our  11    th     and 12     th     grade ELLS and to improve their academic performance we will  increase communication  with parents. Another part of the program requires teachers to meet with a small group of our  ELLS to provide guidance and tutoring and also call parents on a weekly basis. More broadly,  we aim to increase our interactions with ELL parents through the efforts of our bilingual   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          84         Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    (English-Spanish) parent coordinator, strong and caring bilingual office staff, and growing  bilingual teaching staff. Our bilingual office staff and guidance counselors make daily phone  calls home to students who miss class in order to encourage regular attendance. Our bilingual  parent coordinator co-chairs the school’s PTA, which elected several ELL parents as officers last  year, and we expect this trend to continue. We make every effort to communicate with parents in  their native language, whether it be written or spoken. For example, all letters and invitations  sent home to parents of ELLs include translated copies of the information in the student’s native  language; all phone calls home are done in the parent’s first language, when possible.  Lastly,  our Summer Bridge program, which welcomes all students—including ELLs to BCA and invites  their parents to a concluding day of presentations. Presentations and workshops are conducted by  our bilingual staff/teachers.     Faculty and staff at BCA come into regular contact with parents: through SKEDULA (bilingual  attendance and grading program) faculty maintains a grade-level call log to track all  communication with parents, including those of ELLs; our office staff members are in frequent  touch with parents about attendance or other non-academic issues; and our parent coordinator is  responsible for staying in regular touch with the needs and recommendations of all parents,  including ELLs’.  Additionally, two bilingual Deans of Students communicate regularly and  effectively with parents of ELLs in their native languages (in most cases) regarding uniforms,  behavior, and Collegiate Credits. Finally, BCA administers a parent survey every year, and ELL  parents are encouraged to complete the online survey in the school building so that our bilingual  office staff can assist them with completing the survey accurately, should they have any  questions. In addition we also have an event with monthly parent meetings with the  Administrators.This provides parents and staff an opportunity to meet with the principal and  administration to discuss different issues and concerns. In such an environment parents are  provided with an opportunity to discuss a range of topics. 3 of the 4  administrators are bilingual  and provide translation services during meetings.       At BCA, we believe that all parents deserve the opportunity to be heard. For this reason, we hold  regular PTA meetings which involve a question and answer section for parents to address their  questions or concerns. As for the ELLs, our ELLs’ Parent Nights serve the same function: to get  students’ parent directly involved in the academic and social community at BCA. At both these  regular events, parents are invited to BCA, learn what their students are doing first-hand from  teachers, and are given the opportunity to share their thoughts with the BCA staff and  administration. The Inquiry project for this year, in which a particular staff member will mentor  many ELLs, for this year, in which many ELLs will be mentored by a particular staff member,  will also include regular calls home. Though these calls home do not typically result in a parent  coming to school, staff are instructed to both share their impressions of a given student’s  performance in school as well as listen to the parent’s concerns. Every effort is made to  communicate with a parent in their native language, even if this means that a bilingual staff  member places a call on behalf of another teacher. Finally, between the work of the two Deans of  Students, office staff, and faculty, there are frequent calls made to parents (most of which are  made in their native language). During these communications, we are sensitive to the demands of  parents.                 2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          85   Part E: Budget   FOR SCHOOLS NOT CONCEPTUALLY CONSOLIDATED ONLY.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  1. ENL teachers use various reading and writing assessments to evaluate student’s proficiency in English for both incoming and  returning students. For a baseline teachers also used NYSESLAT Data and an ESL Brainpop Placement test. Over 50% of new  9th graders scored Expanding. All 9th grade students were placed in an ENL class according to their level. For the 10th-12th  graders NYSESLAT along with ELA regents data are used to schedule their classes. In addition for newcomers and SIFE students  we also us Wilson Reading and Reading Plus data which  are used to evaluate students’ literacy skills. In terms of reading we  see that about 90% our students are reading below grade level. For the year we will be focusing on strategies and skills, which  assist students in improving their reading and writing skills. Teachers use this data to continue developing the lessons plans  using various strategies which are scaffolded and differentiated including in order to help students improve their reading and  writing skills. All the data is evaluated as a department and then communicated to other departments in order to better assist  both teachers and students. As a school, BCA is developing an instructional plan which focuses on developing reading, writing  skills in ENL class and through content areas. This year our core content area of focus is ELA where our ENL/SPED/ELA teachers   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          88         will co plan and develop curriclum using HMH Collections in order to prepare students according to the Common Core  Curriculum and then facilitate a writing workshop with focus on content area writing. This will assist students in  developing their writing skills with content foundation. With the aforementioned, teachers will participate in Inquiry meetings  to discuss ELLs academic progress, the combination of Inquiry meetings and assessments assist teachers in acquiring more  knowledge to better assist each ELL student.        2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   At BCA all teachers are required to participate on Peer-Intervisitation teams, PD weekly and once a month. In addition  teachers are also provided with scheduled planning time for Co-Teachers and in Departments. This year all the meetings will  have an ENL component in order to focus on developing more integrated skill/content based curriculum and practices which  will assist ENLs academically and socially.   Data ranging from classwork, teacher anecdotals, Interium Assessments, Regents  and NYSESLAT will be used to facilitate our understanding of student.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  9th graders take the ESL Brainpop Baseline Test and this data is used to schedule their classes based on their level. For 10-12th  grade their NYSESLAT scores and Regents exams are used to determine their schedules. For students who need more literacy  development students are also given the Wilson Reading test in order to help them with basic literacy skills. Across the grades  teacher also use performance task data from their in class assignments, Interium Assessment data and in class quizzes.  Students progress is measured based on scores and then interventions are put in place to assist if their scores are low. A whole  week after each IA is designated for intervention so students get immediate feedback and develop their skills.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Classes are created to support the students who need more literacy in 9th grade. A Wilson reading class is also provided to  assist students with basic literacy. All students are tested each semester to ensure they are making progress with literacy.  There are also after school classes to assist students along with Saturday programs. Across the grades teacher also use  performance task data from their in class assignments, Interium Assessment data and in class quizzes. Students progress is  measured based on scores and then interventions are put in place to assist if their scores are low. A whole week after each IA  is designated for intervention so students get immediate feedback and develop their skills. After school tutoring is also  provided when needed.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   NA      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   On the overall NYSITELL scores the majority of our ENL students are in the high intermediate proficiency level across the  grades. We had 5 new admits who took the NYSITELL. 4 scored Commanding and 1 Entering. The NYSITELL data shows we have  1 Entering student. In the NYSESLAT data  the data shows students 27 moved up one or more levels, 23 scored Commanding  and 41  remaining at the same level.  In order to assist students and teachers more PD on sound ESL strategies will be included  more consistently throughout the grades. This will be done effectively through the work of content area teachers working with  ESL pedadogues to effectively incorporate the skills students are utilizing to move up one level on the NYSESLAT. As for the  NYSITELL all new beginners will have the required minutes of ENL services in addition to providing tutoring. Beginners will also  take a Wilson Reading class to help them. As for the Regents Data all students who did not pass regents will take part in the  ELT classes  which are specially designated to assist them in developing their skills.        7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   We review the data using EDAT and other reports in order to make all the necessary adjustments for students.    2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          89           Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.

Freestanding ENL program.   Our free-standing ESL students receive at least the mandated number of instructional minutes appropriate to their  proficiency levels, as outlined in the next response.  All Entering level students receive a minimum of 540 minutes of ENL instruction per week; 180 minutes for ENL and  then 180 ENL/ELA. Emerging students at BCA receive at least 360 minutes of ESL instruction per week with 90 minutes  for ENL and 180 for ENL/ELA with 90 minutes of integrated Social Studies class.  Transitioning students receive a  mininum of 180 minutes; 90 minutes of Integrated ENL/ELA or Integrated ENL/Social Studies. Advanced ENL students  are programmed into 180 minutes of Integrated ELA/ENL or Integrated Content Area/ENL. Proficiency/Commanding  students receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or Integrated Content Area classes. At BCA all Stand-Alone classes  are taught by an ENL teacher and the integrated classes are taught with an ENL pedagogue and a content area  pedagogue. For the Entering students classes in ENL are homogenous with the exception of 2 or 3 students. 9th  graders at BCA travel in cohort but are separated by proficiency level during their ESL and ENL/ELA classes.

Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   All content area classes for ELL’s at Bronx Collegiate Academy are taught in English and all of the Social Studies classes for ELLs  have an ESL pedagogue supporting students in class.  In 9  th   and 10  th   grades ELLs are also supported in their ENL/ELA  integrated class. Content area strategies for the ELL’s include graphic organizers, building background knowledge, content area  literacy strategies, identification of cognates, scaffolded writing exercises, and other methods to support literacy. Materials  include textbooks, visuals and graphic organizers and technology such as the Smartboard, Internet, and ELMO.  ENL teachers  provide content area support in several ways.  When co-teaching a class, the ENL teacher will plan or review lessons to ensure  that the language is comprehensible for the ELL's.  The language of a lesson can be simplified but not the content. The ESL  teacher will offer strategies that are helpful to ELL's, as well as assessment ideas. The ENL teacher will also focus on delivering  content area vocabulary in an understandable way.  The ESL teacher works with students in small groups or individually.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?    All new Spanish speaking ELL’s are evaluated using the Spanish Lab or Spanish Regents. Practice exams in their Spanish classes  which are administered by the certified Spanish teacher. Various formal and informal screeners are also used to evaluates  students language. Regents are also provided in the native language. Regents are also provided in native language.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Bronx Collegiate Academy makes every effort to service all ELL’s within the constraints of a small school and teaching staff.    5a. When necessary, SIFE students are offered multi-grade programs to make up any skills or credits missed through  interrupted formal education. Content area teachers support SIFE students with a variety of ESL strategies. Smartboards,  ELMO overhead projectors and computers are used in the classroom. After school support is available in all content areas.  Scaffolding and differentiation are utilized in the classroom. Students are also placed in our Wilson Reading program to assist  with basic phonics.  5b. Newcomer ELL’s are grouped Homogeneously at first to allow for both intensive targeted instruction and to allow time for  students to adjust to the new school setting. When available, special summer school classes are offered for newcomer ELL’s to  help support ENL instruction before the school year belongs. After the 9th grade, summer school programs facilitate language  and skills review as students’ progress to the upper grades. Regarding testing, Newcomer ELL’s are introduced to standardized  testing procedures within the first year through the NYSITELL and NYSESLATpreparatory excercises. Because Newcomer ELL’s  may never have been exposed to standardized testing, teachers in these classes take extra care to explain and practice testing  procedures. In the classrooms, teachers differentiate using projects, group work and pair work. Activities are scaffolded. For  reading, content is differentiated according to the students' individual level and classrooms have new leveled libraries. ESL  strategies, such as visuals, graphic organizers and scaffolding are used by all teachers. The Reading Plus reading program, an  independent reading program on the Internet, is used twice a week. After school support is available in all content areas.  5c. Students who have received 4-6 years of ENL instruction have generally achieved proficiency in one or more of the  language modalities (Listening,Speaking, Reading or Writing) but need targeted instruction to achieve full proficiency. Teachers  review these students Interim Assessments and NYSESLAT scores to identify specific areas of need, and program and plan  instruction to accommodate the students’ continued progress. The BCA literacy program provides for a period of reading and a  period of writing each day. We also use the reading and writing program, Reading Plus. It is an independent reading program  accessed on the Internet that students use in class 2-3 days a week. We offer a Regents Prep class to 11th and 12th ELL's and  the writing focus will be on essay formats similar to those on the ELA Regents exam.  5d. Teachers continue to assess specific language needs for Long Term ELLs. Generally, these are upper classmen who have  completed their required credits but struggle with the Regents Exams, typically those in ELA and Global History. Students are  offered targeted instruction in academic reading and writing, as well as content area literary and test preparation strategies to  prepare for the Regents.   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          91      5e. After testing proficient students are placed in ELA and regular content area classes. They are provided with access to all ESL  services and after school ENL programs. Also all ELL accomodations mandated by the state are in place to facilitate their  transition into mainstream classes.        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Programs for ENL/SWDs are scheduled in meetings by the SPED coordinator, Ms. Lieberman, the ESL coordinator, Ms. Rivas  and the scheduling coordinator, Ms. Vartanova. Students' scores on the NYSESLAT and SPED academic testing such as the  WRAT, KTEA and Woodcock and Johnson are considered during student placement process. Their needs and the ENL/SWDs are  placed in small classes with integrated co-teaching. Learning styles are evaluated and differentiation occurs through leveled  learning. The literacy block provides for one period of reading and one period of writing each day. The classrooms have leveled  libraries and students read independently during the reading period. Instructional strategies include visuals, building  background knowledge, scaffolding and pair and group work. Technology such as the Smartboard, ELMO and computer tasks  are also utilized in the classroom. Every effort is made to provide appropriate programs for ENL-SPEDs the classroom teachers  use ESL strategies, such as visuals, building background knowledge and graphic organizers, to facilitate understanding. Tasks  are scaffolded and differentiated to ensure comprehension. In some content areas, textbooks and workbooks are available in  Spanish or bilingual editions. After school support is also available. Instructional strategies for ENL-SWDs include building  background knowledge, graphic organizers, visuals, understanding of cognates and a wide variety of reading and writing  strategies. We use several sets of textbooks for content areas and Engage NYC for ELA/ENL. Classrooms have leveled libraries  as well for independent reading. Reading Plus a leveled, independent reading program that students access on computers is  also used in our ESL/ELA Sped classrooms. We also offer HOMERUN an after school programs specifically for SWED's and ELL's.  Homerun is an after school program where students receive academic support, social and cultural activities and field trips for  ELL students and parents.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?   For students who have both ELL and special needs, the school programmer reviews their IEP’s and NYSESLAT results and  consults with teachers to determine the combination of instruction that will best benefit each individual student. In general,  the programs and modifications outlined in the IEP inform students placement, but every effort is made to accommodate both  mandated ENL/ELA/NLA instruction along with Self-Contained, Co-Teaching, ICT and Special Education Teacher Support  Services. Students are placed in ICT classes based on the NYSESLAT and IEP requirements.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Bronx Collegiate Academy offers tutoring classes in ELA, math and other content areas to all students three days a  week.Students participate in intervention programs during the school day and after school both programs have ENL  pedagogues to support students academically and socially.   ELL's participate fully in these tutoring classes and a few are  targeted specifically for ELL’s. After school tutoring is also available for beginning ENL students for language acquisition and  other tutoring is offered based on Regents Scores. We also offer support for ENL students in the 9th and 10th grades by  keeping all ENL students in together in Math classes and providing a Bilingual Paraprofessional in the classroom.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?       At Bronx Collegiate Academy we continue to use Reading Plus, Wilson Reading, an independent reading program as well as  Castle Learning Online for supplementary work. We have also implemented the 7 SEAS  program to enhance our students  social, cultural and academic experience at BCA. We've also created a program called CASA which assists students in their  academics and social emotional development.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          92      We have eliminated the Achieve 3000 reading program which is now replaced by Reading Plus. Students were surveyed as to  which program they preferred and Reading Plus got the most votes. Both programs have impacted student achievement but fo  now Reading Plus will continue to be used at BCA.       11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.   ELL’s are encouraged to participate fully in the school life at Bronx Collegiate Academy. ENL tutoring, ENL summer  school/programs and CASA are the supplemental services available for students. We encourage them to learn and socialize  fully with General Education students. We also have various clubs students can be a part of softball, soccer, anime, arts outlet  program, band, cosmetology, community service, dance, photography club, community service, dance, I Will  Graduate/Journalism, Robotics, Student Government, The Future Project, Culture Club.       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  As in all classes at Bronx Collegiate Academy, ELL’s are supported through the use of Smartboards, ELMO overhead projectors,  class laptop carts as well as fieldwork and experts. ELL’s are provided with additional supports, including Reading Plus and  Ipads.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?    Most ELL students at Bronx Collegiate Academy receive native language support, either through Spanish language classes or  tutoring in French with a native French speaker. There are a few students who do not receive native language support because  their native language is not typically spoken here. All students have bilingual dictionaries (English/French), (Spanish/English)  available in classes.  Students are provided glossaries/dictionaries and technology to assist them.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.     All students are grouped by grade and proficiency levels. All students are using the high school curriculum in all subjects which  is aligned to NYS CCLS. Teachers work with our ENL teachers to modify and scaffold for our ENL population.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    NA     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).    When available, ENL summer school programs are offered to incoming ELLs as well as Summer Bridge. Students have an  opportunity to begin or review their language skills, meet ESL faculty and form social and academic relationships with their  peers. Students who enroll throughout the school year are paired with an ESL buddy to help them get acclimated with the new  school and new systems. New ELLs are also programmed with other new comers in our literacy classes to assist them in  developing their English skills. Parent Coordinators, ENL Coordinator, Pedagogues and counselors are always checking in on  students to ensure they feel comfortable in this new setting.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Currently, Spanish is the only native/foreign language offered at Bronx Collegiate Academy.      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          93         d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   NA        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  ELL personnel at Bronx Collegiate Academy is encouraged to attend at least four Professional Development sessions from the  Division of English Language Learners. Teachers attend different sessions and then turn key the information to the rest of the  department or our entire staff if appropriate. Also, once a month BCA holds whole school professional development for all  teachers. At least 4 times a year these sessions have a focus on ELLs which will meet the 15% of total hours ELL specific PD for  all teachers. In addition ENL Pedagogues will attend these sessions plus the QTEL training which is ELL focused.    At BCA we meet regulary as an ESL Department to discuss students needs, assess both teaching and learning strategies.  Weekly meetings including whole school planning and department planning with a specific focus targeting improvement in  teaching our students. The plan is to focus on a different strategy and skill to build students levels of reading and writing  stamina for the year. The ESL department has noticed students need to develop their stamina in all subjects and with this focus  we are adopting proactive methods of integrating strategies to build students' overall academic stamina. All ESL teachers work  and co plan with content area teachers in order to create a scaffolded curriculum based on the Common Core training  provided by NYCDOE to better serve our ENL population. All BCA pedagogues are participating in the Common Core  professional development which also incorporates a focus on ENLs and guidance is also provided by our ENL Support.     Administrators, guidance, secretaries and all school staff participate in various PD about ENL assessments, langauge  acaquisition and needs of ENL families.       During our the monthly/weekly PD all pedagogues will participate in ENL targeted strategies and skill building geared for them  to develop their repertoire on ENL pedagogy. Sessions will include rigor in the class for ENL students, scaffolding, checks for  understanding, vocabulary development and writing strategies for content area teachers.   PD Schedule                          2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  At BCA we meet in Grade Level Teams with at least one ESL teacher in each grade to better assist teachers in understanding  the needs of the ELLS. Teachers have also been assigned a group of ELLS to work with in each grade level. We are also working  together in with various departments and discussing how to incorporate more diverse strategies with a sufficient amount of  scaffolding to better assist ELLs. In the 9th grade especially teachers are guided on how to ensure ELL students stay organized   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          94         and on top of their work. Also, teachers encourage ELLs to stay for tutoring when needed and are given materials to ensure  ELL students have all they need to be successful in high school. All BCA has adopted the BCA binder for students in order to  continue assisting students with developing their organizational skills and college readiness. At this point in the year it seems  to be working effectively. All agendas, attendance and records are kept in google docs and ENL binder.   BCA will continue its plan to work with all the content area teachers either individually or as a department to continue  integrating and developing an instructional plan which serves ELLs. Staff training will be conducted throughout the year as  needed to meet the 15% of total hours of ELL training. ELL personnel at Bronx Collegiate Academy attend at least four  Professional Development sessions from the NYCDOE Office of English Language Learners. Teachers attend different sessions  and then turn key the information to the rest of the department or our entire staff if appropriate. Also, twice a month (every  other Wednesday of every month) BCA holds whole school professional development for all teachers. At least 4 times a year  these sessions have a focus on ELLs which will meet the 15% of total hours ELL specific PD for all teachers. In addition ENL  Pedagogues wil will attend these sessions plus the QTEL training which is ELL focused. All ENL teachers will also be required to  attend 50% of their PD on ESL strategies.             Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?    BCA conducts and Annual Meeting with Parents Schools or guardians of English langauge learners at least once a year, in  addition to parent-teacher conferences, initial parent orientations, quarterly progress meetings or other scheduled meetings  provided for parents or guardians, to discuss the goals of the program, their child's language developement progress, their  child's English language proficiency assessment results and language development needs in all content areas. During this  meeting school staff sufficiently informs the parents or guardians about the child's langauge development in all content areas  in English. Such meetings are conducted with a qualified interpeter/translator in the language or mode of communication the  parent or guardian best understands. Schools must determine the manner and form of such individual parent meetings, in  accordance with collective bargaining agreements. Our ESL Coordinator will record attendance using existing procedures.      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   BCA is continuing its partnership with Counseling In Schools services with the aim of increasing overall attendance and  encouraging parental involvement. Counseling In Schools consists of a bilingual school-based staff, and offers a parent  workshop at the beginning of the school year and throughout the year.  Parents will also be invited to the ELL Parent  Conference night where teachers will speak them individually about their child's academic, linguistic, social and emotional  development. If parents are unable to attend the ESL Department along with Counseling In Schools will make parent phone  calls and appointments to ensure parents are informed about their child's needs. Translations services are available in French,  Bengali, Spanish and English at our school. If needed over-the-phone interpretation services are available through the DOE’s  Translation and Interpretation Unit so that parents can receive language assistance and have their questions answered in their  preferred languages. Our ELL parent involvement has grown in the last couple of years and today we even have one of the ELL  parents as the PTA president. Our BCA community has truly grown in the last couple of years and the parents feel very  welcomed. They are strong advocates for their children and BCA.      Faculty and staff at BCA come into regular contact with parents: faculty maintains a grade-level call log to track all  communication with parents, including those of ELLs; Counseling in Schools and office staff members are in frequent touch  with parents about attendance or other non-academic issues; and our parent coordinator is responsible for staying in regular  touch with the needs and recommendations of all parents, including ELLs’. Additionally, two bilingual Deans of Students  communicate regularly and effectively with parents of ELLs in their native languages (in most cases) regarding uniforms,  behavior, and Collegiate Credits. Finally, BCA administers a parent survey every year, and ELL parents are encouraged to  complete the online survey in the school building so that our bilingual office staff can assist them with completing the survey   2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          95         accurately, should they have any questions.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, D White, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to and  staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 RSCEP-R                                                                                                                                                                                          97                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Bronx Collegiate Academy                                                                              School DBN: 09X227  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
