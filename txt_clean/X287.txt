The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.   In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets, the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement    NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             8      Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.

The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.     Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             9      monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title   I schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             10         1.

The  beliefs and practices will be implemented first within model teacher classrooms and will be presented to the larger  staff through frequent inter-visitation opportunities.       ● Strategic reading periods have been implemented into every students' program. This allows for students to be  grouped homogeneously which allows for targeted reading instruction based on current reading levels. To date,  students on average have made a 3 point increase school-wide on the Degrees of Reading Power Assessment (DRP).    Challenges   The North Bronx School of Empowerment currently has proficiency rates of 20% and 5% in ELA and Math respectively  (2017 Assessments). While this rate has steadily increased over time, there is still a significant number of students  who are performing below grade level in both areas.      Parent engagement is low within the school community. Though a variety of opportunities, events, celebrations and  communication devices are utilized, there is an overall lack of engagement with the school community. However,  overall according to the NYC Environment Survey, parents are overall satisfied with what is taking place within the  school.       Area of Focus for 2017-2018   The North Bronx School of Empowerment has selected the following areas as priorities for the 2018-2019 school year:      Focus on Reading Intervention: Through the MSQI initiative we will continue to focus our efforts on  developing life-long readers and enhancing the skills of our low-performing readers through the use of  Strategic Reading Periods. Staff have already begun to receive specific professional development tailored to a  specific reading needs/programs, and students will be grouped based on their current reading abilities in  order to receive targeted instruction to meet their individual needs. We are also using extended learning time  and our partnership with NY Edge to engage students in additional daily reading opportunities, recognizing  that students need to read a minimum of 4 hours per day to impact their reading level positively.  Furthermore, through the use of Teachers College Reading and Writing Project curriculum, literacy teachers  will further push the development of a culture of reading through the reading and writing workshop during  ELA periods.         Focus on the Development of Mathematics Teachers: Through a partnership with Metamorphosis via our SIG  grant, as well as a partnership with the NYCDOE's Algebra4All Inititative, mathematics teachers will engage in  strategic professional learning, coaching and feedback to develop their capacity and mindset about teaching   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             13               mathematics to middle school students. Teachers will learn how to plan and implement lessons that  emphasize a conceptual understanding to math, while also considering engagement, opportunities to discuss  their learning with their peers, and students individual needs through formative assessment practices.     Positive School Climate: Through the implementation of an effective Positive Behaviors Incentives System   (PBIS), clear expectations for positive behaviors, clear systems for reporting and applying interventions (peer  mediation, counseling, restorative circles, etc), and professional learning opportunities for all staff, we will  create a positive school climate that allows students to feel safe in school so that they are able to focus on  learning. NY Edge will provide students with a safe learning environment after school and on Saturdays so  that students receive additional academic support on areas of needs while also being exposed and  participating in a variety of extracurricular activities and clubs. The school climate and culture team, consisting  or administrators, deans and school aides, will support the above mentioned initiatives and hold students  accountable for expectations as well as remain in consistent communication with parents with regard to  student behaviors. Through our partnership with Phipps Neighborhoods we will be engage students and  families in activities and workshops that promote positive behaviors and choices, as well as positively impact  student attendance through a variety or interventions, celebrations and supports.         2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             14         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 11X287   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08,SE   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   568   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Based on feedback received from a PPO on January 31, 2018:      "Across classrooms, teaching practices are aligned to the curricula and reflect an articulated set of beliefs about how  students learn best that is informed by the Danielson Framework for Teaching and the instructional shifts. For example,  the first classroom consisted of students in triads or pairs in a grade 8 science classroom. At the beginning of the lesson,  the teacher directed the students to discuss the do now prompt: If I told you that I could completely make normal foods  taste completely different from what your traits allow you to taste, what would you say of that statement. True False or  split decision. After the students discussed the prompt, the students used clickers to enable the teacher to see how the  students responded. Afterward, the teacher asked students to share out and use reasoning to support their statements.  As students were responding, the teacher was jotting down notes based on the student responses. Once the discussion  concluded, the teacher explained the task and stated that the students would complete a lab entitled, “Taste Tripping”.  While the students engage in the task, the teacher explained that they needed to identify what challenged them, what  changed and what is confirmed. In addition, the teacher disseminated a number of readings and reminded students to  annotate using aspects of the MSQI Framework to support meta-cognitive thinking while reading. The next classroom  consisted of an English Language Arts classroom where students were in groups engaged in Reciprocal Reading. As  students were reading and engaged in the protocol, the students were using chips to represent whether they were  making a prediction, clarification, question or summarizing. This was put into place based on the school’s findings that  2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             17      the reciprocal reading graphic organizer limited student discussions since it required the students to document what  they were articulating. The chip method was used to support more discussion but highlight where the students are in  their thinking and discussions. The third classroom consisted of students in a mathematics classroom engaged in a do  now where the students had to balance a hanger based on the shapes attached. As the students were working on it, the  students were asked to jot down questions or observations based on the diagram. Once the time expired, the teacher  asked students to share their responses and jotted the responses on the marker board. Moreover, the fourth classroom  consisted of a grade 8 ICT classroom where students were engaged in “Thinking about Misunderstandings”. At the  beginning of the lesson, the teacher modelled a paragraph to the class. After she read the paragraph, the teacher asked  her students to turn and talk to their partners with regard to what is being argued and was the connection made clear.  Afterward, the ICT teacher had a student share out based on the “Model for Your Thinking” graphic organizer to support  his claim. Next, the teacher posted a variety of sentences to assess whether or not students understand if the author  clearly explained how the character is to blame (1.2)."      Based on the 2017 NYS Common Core ELA Assessment for all grades (6, 7, 8) 20% of students performed at proficiency  levels 3 and/or 4 which is a 4% increase from 2016.   Based on the 2017 NYS Common Core Mathematics Assessments for all grades (6, 7, 8) 6% of students performed at  proficiency levels of 3 and/or 4 which is a 1% increase from 2016.       During the 2017-18 school year, students reading score the Degrees of Reading Power   Assessment (DRP) rose an average of 3 points school-wide.   ○ 6th Grade - 4 points growth   ○ 7th Grade - 3 points growth   ○ 8th grade - 3 points growth        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Rigorous Instruction. Your goal must be responsive to the identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   By June 2019, all grades will successfully implement a minimum of 4 periods of strategic reading interventions to all  grades based on students reading levels. Student growth will be tracked throughout the year through the use of the DRP  (degrees of reading power) and running records. This will result in a 5 point increase school wide on the DRP  assessment.            2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             18     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies your  school will implement to achieve the identified goal for this  Framework for Great Schools element, including:   Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

PPO Feedback from January 31, 2018 indicates:      "The Principal and her team exhibit practices that are connected to college and career readiness via the school's College  Access Calendar. The calendar highlights the specific events that happen, monthly, that is connected to being prepared  for the next level. For example, the calendar exhibits a wide array of events such as Educational Superheroes, Student  Workshops, Transitioning to Middle School, Transitioning to High School, College Awareness Day, etc. In addition, the  calendar exhibits a wide array of trips to a number of colleges such as John Jay, Colombia, and Lehman College.  Furthermore, the Principal continues her Advisory program. This school year we will continue to implement an advisory  program for all of our students. The intention is to assist students to develop a better understanding of themselves as  well as how their actions and ideas can have a positive impact on their lives. The school aims to develop empathy in  their students so that they understand that their actions can have a positive or negative effect on those around them,  including but not limited to their family members, friends and their community.

"Although the school can provide evidence to support how the school supports and promotes effective academic  behaviors, more work needs to be addressed with regard to student behaviors. During the student panel, all students  articulated how teachers support them in their academic affairs as well as supporting them through the academic grade  6-8 process. Several students articulated how teachers motivated them to do better in their schoolwork along with  providing them with the interventions necessary to obtain and understand the material. On the other hand, all students  articulated the need to address student behavior and pockets of bullying. For the future, connect with other middle  schools within the district to support how staff and students can campaign around the element of anti-bullying (1.4)."         Informed by Capacity Framework Element – Supportive Environment, current data, the School Environment Survey and  our most recent QR, there is a need to develop and implement a positive behaviors incentive system along with a  structure for discipline in order to create an environment where students feel safe and supported by all stakeholders.

As the meeting  proceeded a teacher member shared a video from the teaching channel based on claims, evidence and reasoning. Video  consisted of students going over the elements but one of the participants articulated that reasoning was the attribute  that needed the most support. As the teacher was explaining the elements of the video, the lead teacher guided the  discussion. In addition, the Principal suggested that they collaborate with the ELA department with regard to a checklist  that used to hold the students accountable. Afterward, the lead teacher posted another video on the “Reasoning Tool”  to support how evidence connects to the claim by demonstrating the tool/graphic organizer based on the evidence  found, why it matters and what is the connection between the two elements. Upon the conclusion of the video,  teachers were connecting the attributes of the video and how it could impact their planning. For example, one teacher  stated that emphasis needs to be on more cohesive tools across the content areas as well as explicit modeling.

For example,  the first classroom consisted of students in triads or pairs in a grade 8 science classroom. At the beginning of the lesson,  the teacher directed the students to discuss the do now prompt: If I told you that I could completely make normal foods  taste completely different from what your traits allow you to taste, what would you say of that statement. True False or  split decision. After the students discussed the prompt, the students used clickers to enable the teacher to see how the  students responded. Afterward, the teacher asked students to share out and use reasoning to support their statements.  As students were responding, the teacher was jotting down notes based on the student responses. Once the discussion  concluded, the teacher explained the task and stated that the students would complete a lab entitled, “Taste Tripping”.  While the students engage in the task, the teacher explained that they needed to identify what challenged them, what  changed and what is confirmed. In addition, the teacher disseminated a number of readings and reminded students to  annotate using aspects of the MSQI Framework to support meta-cognitive thinking while reading. The next classroom  consisted of an English Language Arts classroom where students were in groups engaged in Reciprocal Reading. As  students were reading and engaged in the protocol, the students were using chips to represent whether they were  making a prediction, clarification, question or summarizing. This was put into place based on the school’s findings that  the reciprocal reading graphic organizer limited student discussions since it required the students to document what   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             31      they were articulating. The chip method was used to support more discussion but highlight where the students are in  their thinking and discussions. The third classroom consisted of students in a mathematics classroom engaged in a do  now where the students had to balance a hanger based on the shapes attached. As the students were working on it, the  students were asked to jot down questions or observations based on the diagram. Once the time expired, the teacher  asked students to share their responses and jotted the responses on the marker board. Moreover, the fourth classroom  consisted of a grade 8 ICT classroom where students were engaged in “Thinking about Misunderstandings”. At the  beginning of the lesson, the teacher modelled a paragraph to the class. After she read the paragraph, the teacher asked  her students to turn and talk to their partners with regard to what is being argued and was the connection made clear.  Afterward, the ICT teacher had a student share out based on the “Model for Your Thinking” graphic organizer to support  his claim. Next, the teacher posted a variety of sentences to assess whether or not students understand if the author  clearly explained how the character is to blame (1.2)."      "Although the school can provide evidence to support how the school supports and promotes effective academic  behaviors, more work needs to be addressed with regard to student behaviors. During the student panel, all students  articulated how teachers support them in their academic affairs as well as supporting them through the academic grade  6-8 process. Several students articulated how teachers motivated them to do better in their schoolwork along with  providing them with the interventions necessary to obtain and understand the material. On the other hand, all students  articulated the need to address student behavior and pockets of bullying. For the future, connect with other middle  schools within the district to support how staff and students can campaign around the element of anti-bullying (1.4)."      Based on the 2017 NYS Common Core ELA Assessment for all grades (6, 7, 8) 20% of students performed at proficiency  levels 3 and/or 4.

ELT provides enriching  educational experiences that happen outside of the traditional school day and blend skill acquisition, relationship- building and fun to foster academic and social-emotional growth. Summer learning, afterschool programming, and  extended-day ELT models, when well-implemented, play a critical role in supporting students in all grades and ensuring  that they graduate from high school, college and career ready. SED requires that Priority schools offer a minimum of 200  additional student contact hours as Expanded Learning Time in addition to the current mandated length of 900 hours of  instruction per year (25 hours per week) in grades K-6 and 990 hours of instruction per year (27.5 hours per week) in  grades 7-12. Effective ELT models will blend school staff with community partners, and will provide a balanced  curriculum that can include ELA, Math, STEM, arts, physical activity, and leadership development.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             47         amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             48     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             49      Section 10: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. The North Bronx School of Empowerment, in compliance with the Section  1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent  involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the  families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision- making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School  Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of  the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   The North Bronx School of Empowerment will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             50      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● Actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● Engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● Ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● Support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● Maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.

Community  Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and  family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in  Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health &  Wellness.    Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s)   How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student  academic outcomes?   The CS Strategy has been integrated into academic instruction by providing opportunities for student to engage in AIS  and ELT programming throughout the day and afterschool. This year we are partnering with Phipps Neightborhoods  and Sports & Arts in Schools Foundation to provide push-in academic support during the school day in all content  areas.       Additionally, we have AIS instruction from Smart Start Education which takes place 3 times a week for 50 students in  ELA and 50 students in Mathematics. These students are selected strategically to ensure maximum impact.      To date, last year we saw an additional 4% increase in ELA proficiency on the 2017 NYS Assessment (20% overall) and  a 1% increase in Mathematics Proficiency on the 2017 NYC Assessments (6% overall)      Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to  be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.    By June 2018, students will demonstrate a 5% increase in proficiency on the NYS ELA Assessment as evidence by the  2018 NYS ELA Assessment .      By June 2018, student attendance will increase by 2% to 93% overall for the school year as evidence by the year-end  attendance rate in June 2018/          Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Community School Annual Goal(s):  How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family  Engagement, and Health & Wellness--support your academic goals for students?  A focus on academic engagement through AIS and ELT supports will support student achievement by providing  students with targeted instruction in their specific areas of need. Because class size arrangements will be smaller (less  than 20) students will be able to receive more individualized and specific instruction.      In order for students to learn, they must be present at school on a regular basis. By focusing on attendance will  increase student contact with the school community and ensure that students are present to receive the instruction  necessary to positively impact academic achievement .         2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             57     Part 2 – Community School Partnerships Core Services Action Plan   Part 2a.

Community Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and  services, as determined by the asset and needs assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time  (ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the  right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly  coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day.  Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to  strengthen this initiative.  Community Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and  families feel welcome, actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of  their schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community  School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this family engagement  strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work.  Community School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director,  select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual  students.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Our school utilizes the Degrees of Reading Power (DRP) assessment as part of our participation in MSQI. This assessment  allows us to determine our ELL students' current reading level in English. The current data from 2016-2017 indicates that the  majority of our current and former ELL students are reading below grade level in English. However, this data assists us in  determining the appropriate literacy interventions while insuring that we are considering programs that will provide access for  ELL students. For example, we have purchased MyOn which is a reading program that provides students with access to books  directly correlated to their reading level. This program also offers ELL students access to books in their home language and/or  translations.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             66         The ENL team meets every week to look at student work and assessments and analyze the data. After looking at the data and  making assumptions/asking questions, the team analyzes the data for trends and patterns and things that are being  overlooked/not explored yet. Then the team generates possible explanations and draws conclusions about data. The data then  is shared with the other teams and is used to write targeted lesson plans.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Our school uses benchmark assessment data, such as Word Generation,  TC Writing, I-reading and DRP. For reading  assessments we use Fountas & Pinnell which  determines student's independent and instructional reading levels.d NYSESLAT  scores to measure growth for ELLs and identify areas of need.  Furthermore,  end of the unit or chapter assessments are given.  For math, the benchmark assessment tool used are Go-Math and the I-ready math diagnostic which is beneficial for providing  differentiated instruction, determine students strengths and weakness and to determine when students are ready to be  further challenged. Once results/ scores are in then one on one conferences are given to provide specific feedback and to  continue to monitor growth and progress.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    The ENL team meets to collect, reflect and analyze the data and come up with an action plan to be followed until the next  cycle. The team goes through assessment short cycles to determine goals, implementations and revisions of instructions based  on data collected.  Our Tittle III entitles us to have a Saturday Academy where we invite our ELL students to attend  for additional instruction which is designed to support our ELL students in developing skills needed to meet gaols, assessments  and standards.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   The Academic Intervention Service program was implemented to help students who were struggling to achieve the learning  standards In English.  the program was designed to include multiple approaches to learning that strengthen a student's skills  and strategies. Furthermore, ELLs learn organization and problem solving strategies, including how to respond to questions  requiring critical thinking skills.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   NYSESLAT data indicates that students perform better on the listening and speaking portion of the assessment that the reading  and writing portion across grade levels and proficiency levels. Additionally, data indicates that students with disabilities take  longer to demonstrate growth in overall proficiency.  Furthermore, after evaluating the data, school leaders and teacher  pedagogy is too develop coherent set of beliefs about how students learn best is informed by data base assessments, the  instructional shifts and the Danielson Framework for Teaching aligned to the curricula, engaging, improving and strengthen  teachers' practice to meet the needs of ELL students.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   At the beginning of each year the ENL teachers distribute a list of the RLAT report  in order for the teachers to know who the  ENL students are and be familiar with their language proficiency levels. Throughout the year,  the ENL team disseminates the  findings through biweekly presentations, also sharing the team's action plan and adjustments made, helping the other teams  be aware of the ENL specific needs and allow them to adjust their action planning, and lessons to suit the specific needs of the  ENL population. Furthermore, every week the data analyses report is downloaded on Google drive, for all the staff to access it.

How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   The ENL teacher provides a combination of push-on and pull-out services based on students' current language  proficiency level.  ELL students are placed in the same class within their grade-band to ensure that the ENL teacher is  able to provide consistent push-in services as needed and is able to provide support to the content area teachers.The  stand alone program present at our school is the Free Standing ENL, based on parent survey and program choice.  During pull out the students are grouped heterogeneously with mixed proficiency levels. During the integrated ENL,  the ENL teacher and the content area teacher co-teach in order to help students build English Language skills through  content area instruction.     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.      N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              Students are provided instruction in ENL and ELA are per state mandates based on each students proficiency level based  on the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT assessments, as per new CR Part 154 mandates. Our students are serviced based on the  proficiency level. Our Entering(EN) and Emerging(EM) students are receiving 360 minutes of ENL. Our Transitioning(TR) and  Expanding (EX) students are  receiving 180 minutes o ENL, and our Commanding(CM) students are receiving 90 minutes of  ENL.. All ELL's are programmed in STARS accordingly using the monthly EDUR  ( ELL data Update Report).        3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      Core content is delivered in English. However the ENL teachers push in to these classes as per state mandates to ensure that  ENL students are provided the appropriate support as needed. Students are also provided with access to translated  dictionaries and glossaries in their home language so they can access the content in their home language as needed. Our ENL  teachers actively plan with content area teachers to provide instructions in student's home language whenever possible. The  curriculum used by our ENL teachers is aligned with the CCLS and activities and scaffoldings used are aligned with the CCLS to  meet the demands of CCLS, as well as foster language development.  The organizational model consists of  pull-out and push-in program based on grade level.  The program models heterogeneous blocks. Two teachers are providing ESL services.  One teacher is providing ESL services for  grade 6 and half of 7th grade ELLs, while the other is providing ESL services for the other 7th grade and 8th Grade ELLs.  These  teachers meet with their ELL students five days a week for 45-minute blocks.  ESL services are provided in English.  Language and Content objectives are used to make content comprehensible and  accessible.  Pictures are used to support understanding for our beginning learners.  Students are expected to record their  understandings in a learning log at the end of each block.  Learning logs are evaluated to assess for understanding.  Discussions  about what was learned as well as misconceptions identified through the learning log are addressed in the next day’s lesson.  The parents of SIFE students are contacted by phone weekly.  Lessons are documented to ensure that when the student does  return to school, he or she will be able to complete projects, assignments and activities that were completed while he or she  was out.  Assessments were conducted to determine the child’s English language proficiency, and the appropriate level of  instruction.      2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             68         4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      The LAC uses current DOE systems and reports to ensure that students are provided with the appropriate assessments  throughout the school year.  The Spanish LAB is administered for newly identified Spanish speaking ELL's as well as translated  exams. Furthermore,the ENL teachers prepare exams in students home language whenever possible and bilingual teachers at  our school help score the exams to determine the students progress.Furthermore, school-wide periodic assessments are  administered in Math, Social Studies, and Science, four times a year, and the exams are sent to Ericsson's Translation for  scoring.        5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a. Currently, there are is one  SIFE students in our school. In September the ENL teachers will look at the newcomer ELL's and  determine which ones are SIFEs. The plan our school has for those students is as follows. The teachers will help the students  with pushing in the content areas as well as pull them out in small groups while also work with them individually. The students  will work with programs such as WIilson or MyOn. The students will be allowed to visit and re- visit the same  language,(repetition of texts and skills), and attend to their pronunciation. The students will also be partnered with higher  proficiency learners in order to become integrally involved in the lessons and be able to interact with other students.   b. For our ELL's who have been in US schools for less than three years the ENL teacher will also be pushing in and help the  students in the content area in English, and their own language(Spanish). The ENL teacher has been provided with Math and  Science textbooks to adhere to the needs of newcomers and materials in Spanish are provided to the ENL newcomers.   c. For students who have been receiving services 3-6 years, we use formal as well as informal assessment. For formal  assessment we use rubrics, quizzes and the DRP assessment. As informal assessments Accountable Talk and Teacher-Student  conferences as well as peer and self-assessment are conducted. For long term ELL’s who have completed six years of ENL  services and those who have reached an advances level on the NYSESLAT exam, teachers use instructional strategies that  enable them to master skills necessary to function academically. These students engage in peer and self-assessments as well.  ELL’s who are identified as having special needs such as speech, resource, counseling or full time special education are serviced  as per an individualized educational plan, upon completion of an evaluation by the School Based Support Team. To ensure that  Special Education whose IEP mandates ENL services the ENL teacher has to report the ENL services on the SESIS system. The  ENL teacher reports the mandated minutes(depending on the student's proficiency level) and the language/content goals that  the child has achieved during the session. Furthermore, the administration holds periodic meeting with the ENL and special  education teachers to assure that the appropriate instructional strategies.        d. Our ELL students receive test accommodations in the periodic and standardized tests. Every students is entitled to time  and a half as well as a separate location. Furthermore, our former ELL students, also receive two more years of ELL service  after becoming former ELL's. They also receive extended time(time and a half) as well as separate location accommodations.           6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   The ENL and special Education teacher discuss if the materials select for the instruction meet the special needs of children.  Interactive learning where students see, hear, touch the materials in order to maximize learning, are emphasized. The teachers  and the administration work together to select instructional materials that have all students in mind. the teachers ensure that  visuals are used and they are appropriate for all. Furthermore, teachers discuss ways and materials used to demonstrate and  simulate the learning concepts. students use games, technology and other hands on materials to understand the learning  concept better. Moreover, overheads and projectors are used to help the students visually as well. In addition to support visual  learners we provide written instructions, pictures and graphics to help guide their learning. Students are also peered with  other students to interact and ensure learning. Furthermore, the ENL teacher has an input on the ELL-SWD's IEP and the  mandated minutes are recorded on the IEP.  Also, scaffold instruction is used so students receive comprehensible input and   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             69      are able to successfully complete a task at their level. In terms of modalities, read-aloud strategy is used because it encourages  students to practice reading and learning new words. Furthermore, students are listening to a story and speaking to one  another about the characters and events. In addition, read alouds allow students to draw upon their reading comprehension  skills. In addition,  students will be able to write about the main characters, main ideas and themes through brainstorming  and  discussion.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  To ensure that flexible programming is used to maximize time spent in a non-restrictive environment, students are pulled out  during ENL where they learn with other ENL students. ENL special Education students and mainstream ENL students are  grouped together and learned together. The ENL teacher pairs up the students according to their proficiency level and the  students have a chance to work with different groups of students every time. Students who have been tested proficient in  NYSESLAT will be able to continue receive ESL services for one more year. They will continue to be part of after school  programs that are planned for ELL's. They will continue to be accommodated with separate testing locations and utilize time  and a half on all exams.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  All English Language Learners are eligible for After School Tutoring and are grouped according to proficiency level regardless of  grade. During Saturday school, the goal will be to develop proficiency in English; therefore the language of instruction will be  English. During the mandated school day, students will receive literacy instruction using reading intervention programs such as  “Wilson”.  Some other programs used in our school in ELA, Science and Social Studies, "Word Generation" as well as "MyOn"  and "Boost and Blitz". During our after school program, students will receive homework help in the areas of Social Studies,  Science and Mathematics. Former ELL's will also receive testing accommodations for two more years. Those accommodations  include but are not limited to different testing location, extra testing time, they take the Mathematics and Science exam in  their first language. Students who have scored an proficient on the NYSESLAT are invited to attend After School Academy for  two more years if place allows. Parents of the above students are notified that their child has passed the NYSESLAT exam but  they still are eligible for continuing transitional support for two more years. With the approval of the parent the students still  continue to receive ESL services through the ESL push in or pull out program. The ENL teacher Ms. Kozi helps the students with  the content area materials. She works with them on completing class-work, worksheets in different content area. She  continues to teach content vocabulary through readings and helps them with writing as well. Furthermore, all former ELL's will  continue to receive 90 minutes of integrated instruction for two more years after they  exit the ELL status, as per CR Part 154.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      New programs that will be considered for the upcoming school year are the two math clubs and the five reading clubs.  Students will have the option to choose  which club they would like to join. Furthermore, the school will continue working with  the MSQI Literacy Program to encourage & help students the importance of reading for academic purposes and also for  pleasure.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  To ensure that ELL's are afforded equal access to all school programs our school ENL teachers have access to the same  materials as classroom teachers such as access to a variety of books and various reading levels, as well as specialists such as  Reading specialists, Speech providers, social workers and guidance counselors. Classroom personnel is trained with second  language acquisition principals and sheltered content teaching strategies. We also ensure that curriculum materials are  appropriate for student's language and cognitive levels. Our ELL's have the same access to library and classroom computers  and software. During our after school and Saturday program(tentative programs), students will receive homework help in the  areas of ELA, Social Studies, Science and Mathematics. Former ELL's will also receive testing accommodations for two more   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             70      years. Those accommodations include but are not limited to different testing location, extra testing time, they take the  Mathematics and Science exam in their first language.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  In order to appropriately address the needs of our ENL population our school utilizes technology. Teachers are supplied with  laptops. Furthermore, all classes have access to brand new smarts boards  and the interactive software that accompanies this  tool. Having the interactive whiteboards allows many different forms of media including photos, illustrations, maps, graphs  and games can be displayed. In addition,  the smart board not only enriches the classroom experience but also helps to expand  the nature of content that can be used for learning. Also,  having a smart board  helps support the learning styles of our ELL  students. For instance, visual learners can watch as their teacher the smart board to project visual elements, whereas audio  students can listen and have discussions.  In addition to the smart boards, teachers have access to laptop. Every ELL learner has  the opportunity to participate or contribute through classroom discussion. Furthermore our ell students can participate in  online quizzes, surveys, class work and homework assignments that are projected directly onto the smartboard by using the  laptop provided to them. Lastly, using technology can enhance the curriculum of all core content areas because it allows  students to be the center of their own learning.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   The ENL program that our school offers in the ENL freestanding program. The instruction in the program is delivered only in  English. The ENL teachers however, use the students' first language when needed with the new arrivals. They pair them with  students who are more advanced language learners and speak the same language. Furthermore, bilingual dictionaries,  available translated state exams and dual language materials are also used. The ENL teachers and well as content area  materials in students' home language whenever possible.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    The ELL students are grouped according to their proficiency level. The ENL teachers plans lessons according to the needs and  language proficiency level of the students. Furthermore, all the ENL and classroom teachers use materials and instructions that  correspond to the language and grade level of the students. To help our ENL- students with disabilities who need help in  reading the "Leap frog" tag school reading system is used. Combining it with the activity storybooks, the students are able to  develop support IN reading skills, including phonemic awareness, vocabulary development and sentence building. ENL and  content teachers deliver instructions by grade and reading level helping ELLS develop the appropriate vocabulary at the  appropriate pace.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Our school shares the building with one other school. We share the library, computer lab and auditorium.  We have a mutual  respect for each other school's unique culture. Furthermore, we communicate via e-mail  both prinicpals of each school  our plans and actions to use the above shared spaces effectively to ensure that all ELLS needs are met.  In addition, we share  resources( i.e materials from PDs, online webites, etc) with other ELL teachers to ensure all students needs are met.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   The parent coordinator, school counselor, and ENL teachers invite parents to visit the school to ensure that they are well  informed of the services they are entitled to for their children. This practice extends throughout the school year. The ENL  teacher holds the orientation meeting for the parents/guardians of the newcomer students upon admission and a one extra  ENL parent teacher conference is help as per CR Part 154.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    All 8  th   grade students including ELL's are enrolled in Foreign Language Instruction. This year, students will be provided  Foreign Language  instruction in Spanish.      2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             71         18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Teachers are encouraged to seek outside professional development as a resource for obtaining support in ELL instruction.  Additionally, the ENL teachers provide individual support to teachers as requested.   All teachers, including the teachers of ELL’s meet weekly in content area teams to ensure effective implementation of best  practices, including practices for ELL students. Our ELA and Math PLT's are sensitive to the needs of our ELLs and have worked  to infuse documentation of goals, strategies and progress of targeted ELL students at bi-weekly meetings. This ensures the use  of data from LAB-R, NYSELAT, ELL Period Assessment, Acuity, Content Area Interim Assessments and ELA and Math scores to  drive instruction. In addition, our ENL teacher/liaison  attends all available professional development workshops available;  upon her return, she develops a plan to turn-key strategies and skills they have acquired. This effort fosters collaborative  lesson planning, and an updated approach to understanding the on-going needs of our ELL population     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Teachers and parents coordinators are greatly supported by the school leadership and the guidance counselor to help ELL  students transition from one school to the other. Teachers as well as the parent coordinator attend the appropriate workshops  on how to best help ELLs transition. Furthermore, the teachers and the parent coordinator meet monthly with the Assistant  Principal to identify the needs that our ELL students have as they transition and discuss ways to help their transition easier.  Furthermore, our guidance counselor has attended many workshops in order to help the families of our ELL's as well as our  teachers. After attending those workshop she meets with the teachers and parent coordinator monthly to help our Language  Learners make a smooth transition, by teaching them strategies to identify the diverse needs of ELLs and explore ways of  meeting these in a motivating and effective manner.The guidance counselor help teachers on appropriately delivering  instructions to ELL students, on how to help the students by having courses clearly outlined at the beginning, how to give the  ELL students more personal attention.   In order to fulfill the the minimum of 7.5 hours of ELL training, our ENL teachers have attended a wealth of workshops on ENL  teaching strategies, some of them including but not limited to, strategies for teachers of ELL in special education setting,  Targeted Instructions for ELLS, Designing best practices for ELLS, Common core state standards for math and how to make it  happen for ELLS. Other classroom teachers have attended various of the above mentioned workshops. Other teachers have  attended workshops on how to help ELL students learn content area subjects. Records for the workshops that our ENL  teachers have attended, are in the school's ENL Compliance binder. For the rest of the workshops and professional  development our school secretary keeps records of.          2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             72      Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Parents are encouraged to attend an annual individual meeting where they can discuss the goals of the ENL program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessments results and language development needs in all of the content  areas.  Records of agenda and sign -in sheets are kept in in a binder in the main office and with the ENL  Coordinator.  Translation and Interpretation services are provided via phone or a staff membey who speaks the language of  that parent.  The LAC meets with parents throughout the year to ensure that they are well-informed about how services are  rendered, goals for our ENL program and how to interpret assessment results. Furthermore, parents are encouraged to meet  with the ENL teachers and discuss progress of students at any time.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  We are fortunate to have several staff members who are able to provide interpreting/translation  services in Spanish which is  the predominant home language of our ENL population. For other languages we provide translators as needed in the necessary  home language by using the Translation and interpretation Unit from DOE. Additionally, all materials provided in the above  activities are translated in the parents native language and for ENL parents who are not able to attend, the materials are sent  home. Our parent coordinator works with the ENL teachers to see parents  and appropriately address their needs. There are  parent breakfast and luncheons to meet with parents to review students progress and NYSESLAT scores.  The ENL coordinator  creates agendas and sign-in sheets for parent attendance which is kept in a binder in the ENL office.  The parent coordinator  informs ENL parents about how they can be active participants in assisting their children to learn English, achieve at high levels  in core academic subjects, and meet the same challenging state academic content and student academic achievement  standards as all other children are expected to meet.  We have parents participate in Potlucks and other events where they  can meet and share their experiences and encourage each other.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Magdalen Neyra, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             74                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   The Forward School                                                                              School DBN: 11x287  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
