The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7     In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           8       NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           10         1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Section 4: SCEP Overview      At ISLA, it is our mission and primary goal to prepare our students to graduate from high school, attend college, and  be equipped for the challenges of the 21st Century. We are building a community of bilingual learners who are  academically and linguistically strong in both English and Spanish. The ISLA community, which includes the families of  our students, will sustain excellence by creating an environment of life-long learners who develop a belief in  bilingualism as being an asset of academic excellence.    It is our vision, as a Community Learning School, to support our students academically and holistically. We will  educate students, their families and our school community in order to develop successful, productive, multicultural  citizens that are college and career ready.    We want to prepare students for college so they can create positive changes in their home and global communities.  To achieve these ends we must ensure that our English language learners excel in their acquisition of the English  language, and achieve in their academic subjects, at the same time, addressing our school wide focus on writing.          2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    We offer students a transitional bilingual program, which means that students can have language arts and content  area instruction in their native language and English as a Second Language based on their English proficiency level  (determined by NYSESLAT or NYSITELL). As students develop English proficiency, instruction in English increases and  native language instruction decreases.    ISLA is a Community Learning School, and as such we have a unique partnership with Montefiore Hospital, Kingsbridge  Heights Community Center, Food Bank of New York, Young Life, and the United Federation of Teachers. Together we  work to provide a full complement of educational, medical, social-emotional, mental-health, and college and career  readiness support for all our students. Our compliment of program supports and services must also include the  families of students in our school and often extends to our community (i.e. other schools on the campus). We now  offer Adult ESL, Parent Workshops, CTE Classes, and....   It is our aim to continue to provide necessary programs and services to assist in making education and achievement a  success for not only our students, but also their families.    ISLA has several Equity and Access Programs in place: College Access for All (both middle and high school), Computer  Science for All, and AP College for All.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   The International School for Liberal Arts (ISLA) is located in the Kingsbridge section of the Bronx in Community School  District 10. It is a 6-12 school that serves a predominantly Hispanic. ISLA has a population of 526 students. The vast  majority are English as a New Language students (ENL) , whose native language is Spanish.    Our challenge as a community of ELLs is to prepare students for the academic work required to graduate, prepare  them for college and beyond, while at the same time support them in acquiring a new language. Some students also       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           11      come to us with interrupted formal education, which requires additional support services in achieving grade level  literacy levels in their native language, Spanish.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Our school supports teacher professional growth through collaboration in teacher teams, common planning, inter- visitations and teacher mentoring. Our teacher teams are committed to improving instruction and thus student  achievement. This is one area aligned to the Framework for Great Schools in which ISLA continues to excel. ISLA  received an Excellent rating (score of 4.07) in this area of the Frameworks. We also exceeded the target in Rigorous  Instruction (with a metric score of 4.16) , and Supportive Environment (metric score of 4.16). Teachers are provided  common preparation time (team meeting time) for effective curriculum planning, collaborative inquiry, parent  conferences, embedded professional learning opportunities and a host of other vital professional work on a daily  basis. The grade level teams and departments also focus on addressing literacy skills across the curriculum.

What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?   In looking at the School Quality Snapshot, according to our last environment survey, students feel safe in the school.  Parents also feel that the school is safe and would recommend the school. This data shows evidences that students feel  safe and want to come to school.    To provide students with a supportive environment, this year we established a school-wide Positive Behavior  Intervention Strategies program that rewards students for good behaviors, such as attendance, arriving to class on time,  completing class and homework, wearing uniform, cooperating in keeping classroom neat and safe. Every teacher will  be using the PBIS Rewards application to provide points to students when display desired behavior, which they can use  to buy items in our ISLA store. Students can also use their points for school-wide events, such as dances or movie nights.   Based the last School Quality Guide (2017-2018) only 59 % of students say that they are rarely or never harassed, bullied  or intimidated. The overall percent of positive response in preventing bullying for differences (religion, gender identity,  weight, etc) is only 66 %. This is one area that we needs to be addressed.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           20      We will also expand community service and internship opportunities. In addition, we will continue to incorporate  strategies to empower students to become leaders, participating in a student-lead government that meets with  administration to have a voice in the decision making process.    To promote student's personal growth, we would like to increase student involvement in more outside community  service. Presently our high school students volunteer in our school community working in the school pantry distributing  food to the community, school beatification projects, tutoring in the middle school classrooms and annual coat  distribution and toy drives. Based on our on-going comprehensive assessment, we will continue to refine programs to  ensure a safe and supportive environment.

We want  students to have a voice and take part of the decision  making process.   In addition, middle and high school representatives attend  the Campus Council monthly meetings to discuss campus  wide concerns, and participate in campus wide activities,  and share best practices on how to address student  harassment, bullying and intimidation.   Students are also part of our School Leadership Team and  CLS Advisory Board.  Student leaders have taken an the lead on the positive  behavioral intervention strategies, including the PBIS reward  system, social emotional learning and peer-to peer support.  School guidance counselors, in collaboration with our  attendance team, work with LTA's students and families  developing support plans.   Community Service- Understanding and servicing the community  helps to promote personal growth, build empathy and self-esteem.  Our students will engage in the following community service  projects:   Food Bank of NY - Food distribution       NY Cares Coat Drive    MLK Day of Service      Big Brother/Big Sister (HS-MS mentoring)     Family Day/Health Fair   Family Day/Health Fair   Sept 2018- June 2019   Volunteer staff  members, GCs,  resource  Coordinator,  administration   Students,  Volunteer  staff,  Guidance  Counselors  (GCs), and  Resource  Coordinator          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           22      Note: All of these activities are available to our students, including  high needs students.      Advisory, Guidance Counseling and Mentoring- These programs help  create a supportive school culture and strengthen the connection  between adults and students in the school.    The Montefiore Clinic can also provide support for students and  their parent(s) if needed.    High School students will continue to work with guidance counselors  and outside collaborating organization on college and career  readiness activities as part of the College Access for All initiative.    Middle School students have college and career courses, and will  also engage in college and career readiness activities as part of CA4A  MS.   Achievement Awards and celebrations-    Throughout the year, students will be recognized for academic  achievement, perfect or improved attendance. Twice a year, we will  have awards ceremony for students, where parents and community  organization are invited.    In addition, at the end of marking periods 1, 2, 4 and 5, grade-level  teacher teams will host awards ceremonies to celebrate academic  achievements and attendance.   Once a year, we will have our National Honor Society (NHS) and  National Hispanic Honor Society (NHHS) Induction ceremony.        3b – Parent and Family Engagement   Sept 2018- June 2019   Administration   Guidance  Counselors,  teachers,  support staff  and clinic  staff,  KIngsbridge  Heights  Community  Center  (KHCC)   Students,  parents,   Sept 2018- June 2019   Teachers, GCs,   Parent Coordinator,  Administrators   How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Supportive Environment in order to  support  the  whole  child?  Include  the  timeline  and  identify  key  personnel  and  stakeholders  responsible  for  implementation and oversight.  Parent Coordinator, Dean and school Guidance Counselors provide various workshops and training for parents  (including beginning of the year orientation for new students). These workshop give parents information about the  grading policy, expectations and procedures. These key staff members share important information about who to see  and where to go if you need guidance and support with any matter related to their child and the school.   In addition to the workshops we usually have for parents, Guidance Counselors, in collaboration with teachers and  the parent coordinator (PC) will lead a series of workshops on bullying prevention, social emotional issues such as  transitioning in to Middle or High school, and Depression in Teens. Depression can sometimes be a results of being  bullied and parents will be taught ways to communicate with their children and identify possible signs of depression  and what to do when these signs are observed. Parents all also informed at meeting and workshops of the School  Discipline Code and the consequences if their child is engaging in bullying or harassing behaviors.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           23      In order to maintain a positive behavioral approach and facilitate students to become leaders and positive role  models, we will continue to provide opportunities for students to engage in community service activities. Parents are  also invited to take part in some of our community events, such as our annual coat drive and Family Day/ Health Fair  events. Achievement Awards Night has always been a way to involve and engage parents and families, in addition to  monthly PA meetings which have a Parent Workshop component. Arts celebrations and Fashion/Talent shows are  another way to engage families and all school stakeholders.        Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment   Part 4a. Indicate resources you will leverage to achieve this annual goal and implement this action plan, including  human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc.  Administrators, Guidance Counselors and grade team teachers are key members in ensuring that we maintain a  positive and supportive learning environment. In addition, our Parent Coordinator and Community Resource  Coordinator work closely with teachers to provide students and families with learning opportunities and events in the  school in order to establish, maintain and strengthen relationships with families.   Both staff members and students are needed to participate in the above action plan. Students are invited to be a part  of various community service projects throughout the year. Through our collaboration with Food Bank of NY, we will  have various food distributions. Some projects are done after-school or on weekends.    Student Council and Campus Council meet once a month. The information is then also shared with the student body  at grade level assemblies, parent meetings, campus council and staff meetings.    Achievement and attendance awards will be presented twice a year in evening ceremonies. All staff, parents and  community members are invited to our events and awards ceremonies.   Instructional resources for counseling or advisory are also necessary so that Guidance Counselor and teachers can  implement a successful advisory program. This year we will also be implementing a school-wide Positive Behavior  Intervention Strategies program.    ISLA is also a part of the DOE initiative, College Access for All (CA4A), Computer Science for All (CS4A) and AP Access  for All (AP4A), part of the City’s Equity and Excellence initiatives. School key team members (Principal, GCs, and  teachers) are being trained. Our main purpose and direction is to develop a mindset that ALL students, regardless of  their background, have the opportunity to attend and succeed in college.     Part 4b.

These tools will also inform us if we need to design supplementary  support activities (trust building, community building, peer mediation, school safety, etc.) to address students’ needs.      Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress.  We will conduct a modified version of the DOE school environmental survey (on Survey Monkey) for students,  teachers and parents in January 2019. Questions on this survey are taken exactly from the questions on the NYC  Survey. The difference is that we have fewer questions aligned to our specific school wide focus. In the Spring 2019  semester, as is customary, we will implement the NYC DOE surveys for students, teachers and parents.     Part 5c. In February 2019, review progress towards meeting the annual goal and make adjustments to the action  plan, if applicable.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           25      Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans   Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success  and improvement of their classrooms and schools.

Include the timeline and  identify key personnel responsible for implementation and oversight.  Teachers, Guidance Department and the Parent Coordinator will collaborate and engage families in various ways  throughout the school year. Our first encounter with parents begins in summer of 2018. During orientation sessions,  parents receive a Parent/Student manual and relevant information they need for the entire school year. During our  first open school night, parents receive course syllabi and school wide grading policy. Throughout the year, our parent  coordinator is available to answer any questions and provide support as needed. During our weekly parent outreach  time, parents are contacted either by mail or with a phone call giving them relevant information regarding student  academic progress, attendance, or social emotional needs.    Parent workshops provide parent with the training and hands on experience on how to access their child's up to date  information on our school wide grading and reporting system, Pupil Path. Pupil Path allows parents to view  assignments, projects, grades, progress reports, attendance and emails from teachers. In addition, we have parent  workshops for parents of students with IEPs to explain the IEP process, inform parents of the alternate pathways to  graduation and answer any questions they may have. These are in addition to our regularly scheduled parent teacher  conferences.    Our SLT and our CLS Advisory Board are instrumental in the planning of many key workshop, events and ceremonies  to not only inform parents, but also celebrate student achievements. Our PA presidents, parent coordinator and  teachers share information throughout the school year. Administration is present at all key meetings and oversees all  key activities.       Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment   Part 4a. Indicate resources you will leverage to achieve this annual goal and implement this action plan, including  human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc.  The human resources include our entire teaching staff. Currently, all teacher schedules incorporate time for  professional learning. Schedules are adjusted so that all teachers are available to work together during a common  period, period 4 for middle school and period 3 for high school teachers. Therefore, all teachers participate in teacher  teams meetings on a daily basis.    Departmental meetings also take place on separate days once a week. In addition, teachers meet weekly in  department-based Inquiry teams, where every teacher is involved in the collaborative inquiry process of looking at  student work and data. Common planning time is scheduled at least once a week.    Grade-level meetings take place twice a week. One time to develop interdisciplinary lessons, units and/or projects as  well as to develop grade-level activities to complement learning, such as educational trips, competitions, celebrations,  etc. Grade-level teams dedicate the second meeting day to parent outreach.    On the remaining day of the week, we schedule professional learning opportunities for teachers on various topics,  such as questioning and discussion, engagement in learning, data protocols and formative assessment strategies,       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           29      based on teachers' needs. This helps support teachers in house. However, we encourage teachers to participate in  out of school PD workshops, who later turn key during monthly faculty meetings.    In regards to resources, teachers in the middle and high school will be using the CCLC aligned Collections curriculum  along with myOn, Achieve 3000 and Smart Science. MyOn is a personalized reading system for students that  recommends books based on students' interests, reading levels and ratings of books. MyOn provides students with  differentiated non-fiction texts that are aligned with students' lexile levels. Texts are also available in Spanish, helping  us support our Hispanic subgroup. Spanish language arts teachers incorporate these texts to support instruction in  NLA classes.   Skedula, Google drive, iLEARN Platforms and Advance are some of the technological resources that we utilize to  enhance our collaboration. Skedula is our online grading and reporting system that allows teachers to submit grades  and anecdotal information. All teachers and administrators have access to it and it allows for ease in following up on  students and viewing relevant information regarding student progress. Parents as well as students also have access to  Skedula, making it a helpful communication tool across all school stakeholders.    This year we will also use PBIS Rewards for all teachers, school aides and support staff to participate in our school- wide PBIS program.           Part 4b.

Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement  planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal.  As a mid-year progress monitoring, the school administration will review meeting agenda, minutes, and important  artifacts (i.e. best practices shared by teachers during meetings). In addition, after the completion of an inquiry cycle,  teachers will reflect on the effectiveness of the implemented teaching strategy in relationship to skills improvement  and progress towards the inquiry and department focus goals. Records of such discussion and reflections are  uniformly recorded in written kept in the teams' binders.       Teacher teams (grade level, department, inquiry and Middle and High School faculty) regularly maintain records of  meetings, attendance, agendas with topics and minutes including action plans, person/people responsible and time- lines. At the end of the year as well as mid-year, teacher teams turn their binders to the administration for revision  and feedback. All meeting minutes, agendas and resources are also available on our school's Google Drive.                2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           30      Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress.  In addition to end-of-inquiry cycle reflections, at the end of each school year, department teams engage in a  collaborative reflection to assess the team functioning and the effectiveness in supporting students to attain the  annual academic goal, using a common school-wide reflection tool. In the 2018-19 school year, we will also complete  this reflection tool at mid-year, to gauge how teams are functioning and whether students are moving towards the  annual academic goal. We expect to maintain a 100% teacher involvement in collaborative teacher teams throughout  the year.       In order to monitor student progress towards the annual academic goal, we will use common assessments  throughout the school. In the beginning of the year, all students engage in a baseline assessments both, in ELA and  Math. Teacher also administers content specific assessments. We also administer the ENL assessment aligned to  NYSESLAT (BOY, and mid-year). The NYC Performance assessment has, in the past provided us with a common grading  rubric and structure for looking at argumentative writing, which is aligned to the CCLS. In addition, in the middle  school, we use common core aligned baseline assessments in ELA and mathematics. The results of these baseline  assessments are recorded, along with grades, in a school-developed ISLA Data Tool chart, used during inquiry and  common planning to refine teacher practice and address students' areas of needs. teacher inquiry teams design  assessments specific to the targeted skills in order to have data to discuss during the inquiry cycle. Interim (fall and  spring periodic) assessments will be used to monitor student growth in the focus areas. Ultimately, our End of Year  (EOY) assessments will measure students' progress from beginning to end of year. Using multiple sources of data,  including formative assessment data in the classroom, in order to truly know and support our students.       Post unit teachers' reflections will serve as another tool to look at best practices. Upon completion of a unit, teachers  will use a unit reflection to analyze and determine which instructional strategies proved to be effective in addressing  student needs. This work will be done in department teams. Resulting information will be used to detect teachers'  strengths and areas of needs and when needed, to design future PD sessions and/or adjust teacher's professional  plans.        Part 5c.

Indicate the data trends, source and year.      1) Overall, our PPO and Environment Survey results have been positive for the past 3 years. Ninety percent (92%) of our  students say they feel safe in their classes and 97 % of parents expressed that they felt that teachers and families think  of each as partners in their child's education.    For the 2017-2018 school year, ISLA scored 4.99 (Quality Review Rating of Well Developed) in response to the Question:  How safe and inclusive is the school while supporting social emotional growth?   This year Rigorous Instruction and Supportive Environment topped the Framework Elements with a score of 4.16 each.    The teacher perception survey has students respond to question around classroom climate, classroom engagement,  pedagogical effectiveness, rigorous expectations and teacher-student relationships. The overall perception is over 76.8  % positive, which is above that of the average in Bronx schools and in NYC DOE schools. The highest rating scores this  year were around pedagogical effectiveness and rigorous instruction.

As a result, we will be focusing on implementing engaging and culturally responsive  instructional methods and strategies in the classroom which also aligns with the Superintendent and the Chancellor's  focus for this year.    Our school report card reveals that the percentage of students that are proficient in ELA went from 15.5% in 2017 to  21.1 % in 2018. In mathematics, the pass rate went from 8.6 % in 2017 to 9.7 % in 2018. Our graduation rate decreased  slightly from 76.6 % to 71.6 % this year. Our NYS ELA Regents (common core) exam scores in high school remained  steady at 65 % in 2018. Common Core Algebra results for June of 2017 went from 67.4% in 2017 to 64% in 2017. Global  History and US History results increased from 67.4 % to 69.8 % and from 73.6 % to 75.2 % respectively.    Based on the feedback from the Superintendent, we will continue to develop teacher capacity to consistently provide  multiple entry points so that students are engaged in challenging tasks and high level discussions. In addition, we will  continue to build capacity to use formative assessment strategies and empower students to self and peer assess.  Teachers will use relevant formative assessment data to effectively adjust and meet individual student needs. Now we  will also provide professional development opportunities in engagement in instruction.    DTSDE recommendations from 2016-2017 have helped us determine our focus last year to identify strategies to foster  students' use of English in order to have them move up at least one level of English as measured by the NYSESLAT. We  will continue to work on this and align it to our focus of providing culturally responsive and engaging ways to this in the  classroom.            Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership.

Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement  planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal.  In order to measure progress, we will use teacher observation Advance ratings. We expect to see a 20% increase in  teacher ratings and movement from developing or ineffective to effective and highly effective compared to beginning  of the year ratings. Also, administrators will look for the use of assessment strategies in a lesson. Teachers should use  at least two methods of assessment in each lesson as evidenced during a teacher formal of informal observation.   Teachers will take a mid-year survey in late January (end of the semester) to assess the progress of meeting the  specified goal. The results will be analyzed and where necessary make revisions for implementation.        Part 5b.

Supporting Students in Temporary Housing (STH)  As included in your Office of School and Youth Development Consolidated Plan STH Section and in accordance with the  federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and Chancellor's Regulation A-780, schools must identify, serve, and  report on students living in temporary housing (STH). For more information on using Title I set-aside funds to support  your STH population, please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions document on DOE's website:  http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/8D99859A-AE04-40EA-A462-5363F87E67E9/0/FAQTitleISetAsideFY14.pdf     Part A: FOR TITLE I SCHOOLS      1. Please identify the number of Students in Temporary Housing who are currently attending your  school. (Please note that your current STH population may not be the same as officially reported in DOE  systems and may change over the course of the year.)   According  to the  most  recent  ATS  report,  ISLA has  132  students  in  temporary  housing.      2. Please describe the services you are planning to provide to the STH population.   The McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act mandates that homeless children and youth have equal access to the  same free appropriate public education provided to children permanently housed in the community. Students  sometimes require additional school support in order to make this possible. Therefore, at ISLA, residency  questionnaires are distributed to every family by the pupil accounting secretary, Ms. Vasquez (also our STH Liason).  This is used to help determine if the child is eligible to receive services under the McKinney-Vento Homeless  Assistance Act. In addition any school staff, who becomes aware of any student who is or may be a homeless student  and who needs assistance, contacts administration, the school GC and/or the STH Liason.   Students in temporary housing are provided with all services comparable to all students in the school. In addition to  any and all services for English language learners, special education services, and school meals.      The school provides students in temporary housing with uniforms and schools supplies. If and when necessary, STH  students are given full fare Metrocard or provided with school bus transportation (if necessary) and free meals  (breakfast, lunch and snacks). In addition, The Parent Coordinator and Guidance Counselors provide families with any  additional referrals and resources upon request. They are also given academic support (tutoring, homework help and  computer hours) and support services, such as counseling if and when appropriate.           2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           44      The school displays a prominent poster in the main office and in the Guidance counselors office that informs STH  students and families of their basic rights.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  Administrative staff regularly attends hiring fairs (as needed) to identify and recruit highly-qualified teachers . Careful  recruitment of new teachers requires that they possess the appropriate license certification with a bilingual or TESOL  extension in their content areas. Certified mentors are assigned to support struggling and/or under-qualified teachers.  New teachers are assigned a mentor to help with instructional planning, behavior management strategies and more  specifically, ESL strategies. Teachers are encouraged and recommended to complete a bilingual extension and/or  TESOL certification to better serve our students population of ELLs.   Teachers are supported with professional development such as Danielson’s Framework for teaching, implementing  the CCLS standards, questioning and discussion strategies, formative assessment techniques, SIOP Instruction,  Gradual Release of Responsibility, ENL strategies, Argumentative Essay Writing, Looking at Student Work Protocols,  and implementation of instructional strategies. Administration takes an active role in helping teachers find resources  and Professional Development opportunities to acquire learning strategies for ELL students. Teachers attend both  DOE and BFSC professional development opportunities on Danielson, the Common Core Learning Standards, Literacy,  Math, and specific content area teaching, based on individual need.        2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the strategies and activities for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, staff, and  paraprofessionals that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).      Our school professional development plan has a threefold purpose:   1.  2.  3.   It is meant to support the rigor required from the CCLS.  It is intended to support teachers improve instruction as per Danielson Frame.  It is aligned to our school wide focus and goals.    All of these are aligned to and influenced by the Chancellor’s Framework for Great Schools, and the  Superintendents PPO priorities.        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           47      In developing this plan, we analyzed the following:   School Quality Snapshot and Guide       Quality Review     PPO recommendations    NY Environment survey    NYS ELA and Math data (Grades 3-8)    High School Regents Exam data    NYC Performance Assessment data    NYSESLAT data    Danielson Measure of Teacher Practice (MOSL) data    Advance reports    Ongoing adjustment made based on individual teacher observations, teacher feedback, student assessment   results, and school wide focus.   In addition, the Frameworks for Great Schools are used as a guide to develop the plan. We also incorporate state  mandates for professional development based on the CR Part 154 requirement. The plan demonstrates ISLA’s  commitment to ensure that every teacher experiences high-quality professional learning so that every student  achieves his or her highest potential. To compete globally, to continue to meet technological, environmental, and  innovation challenges, and to take advantage of opportunities to succeed beyond public school, every student must  have exemplary teaching every day. Professional development is the pathway to exemplary teaching and student  learning. The purpose of this plan is to guide professional learning and be a resource for its educators.      Our school wide focus has been, and will continue to be, writing. Students are asked to write in all content areas. Even  our math teachers have students write their steps to completing math problems and written responses.    Research shows that improved writing improves overall literacy skills. Our students also practice their writing in both  languages, Spanish and English. Students transfer their skills and knowledge from L1 to L2. For this reason, strategies  and protocols used by teachers in Spanish class are shared by our staff members and used across content areas.       In order to improve our ELA scores in all grades, close reading strategies will also be addressed in our professional  development plan. Research links close reading strategies to improved proficiency in reading complex text, and is a  key component of college and career readiness.      This school year, individual teachers, departments and school-wide will implements instructional strategies, activities  and events to help students increase the use of English.      We can’t forget our responsibility (and requirements) to address safety procedures and protocols. These must not  only be presented to teachers, but also to students. Many of our safety professional development must be done on  the first day of school. These are listed here in our professional development plan.          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           48      Teacher at ISLA engage in professional learning every day either through inquiry, common planning, department and  grade team meetings. An important part of our PD has been to have teachers share best practices.   Job-embedded professional development and can take many forms:      1. Inquiry Team-examining student data   2. Classroom observations   3. Common Planning   4. Peer and/or expert coaching (i.e. Talent Coach)   5. Inter-visitation   6. Teachers sharing best practices during meetings and full staff meetings   7. Curriculum and unit mapping   8. Viewing online teaching videos.      All teachers participate in creating and refining the curriculum units they teach. This professional activity supports  their professional growth and ensures high quality teaching. Lead teachers, master and model teachers participate in  citywide and BFSC professional development in Math, Social Studies and ELA, which is then shared with the entire  staff. During common planning, teachers again continue to refine the curriculum to ensure CCLS alignment and rigor.         Part 3: TA Schools Only   3a.

NA        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.        Teacher teams fully participate in all decisions regarding the choice of appropriate multiple assessment measures and  required professional development to meet their professional needs, through surveys and participation in  professional learning communities.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           51      effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.

The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. International School for Liberal Arts , in compliance with the Section 1118 of  Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent  involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the  families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision- making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School  Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of  the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   International School for Liberal Arts will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           53      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:      ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

In the spring semester, teachers meet again to re-group students based on need.  This  program will support students meet the CCSS and prepare them for the mandated assessments.  The focus will be in literacy and writing in all content areas. This is an extension of their  instructional day program.  The student teacher ratio for these programs will be 15 students to one teacher.  There will be 1 supervisor for both programs to ensure the safety of the students and staff. The  supervisor will not be paid for supervision of the program from Title III funds (in-kind).  Supplemental materials for reading, writing and ESL, paper:  Finish Line for ENLs, Reading and  Math at cost.  Classroom supplies for students (notebooks, folders, pens and pencils).

ISLA staff will meets on a daily basis for either lesson planning, curriculum development, and  professional development workshops to support and share best practices.  In order to enhance our  knowledge of students, teachers will participate in the inquiry process, looking at student work  and looking at student data.  Teachers will use data, both quantitative and qualitative, as a means  to assess entry levels and ongoing progress monitoring. Once a month, a professional  development session will be conducted for all pedagogues to reflect on students’ needs.     Our afterschool programs will target our instructional focus of writing.  English Language  Learners need additional support to pass their Regents exams.  Teachers will continue to focus  on meeting common core standards.  We will also have students continue to work on  argumentative essay with a particular focus on developing a counterclaim and using textual  evidence to defend their claims.    In order to support the 6 Title III  teachers in implementing best practices for ELL students, we  will have a minimum of 10 hours Best Practices for ENLs.  Title 3 teachers will remain once a  week for 1 hours. It will be in a 3 week cycle.  They will also engage in professional  development on election day, November 6 (min of 2 hours) on quality ENL instruction  (engagement and discussion protocols).  Our CFN ELL Specialist will be available to provide  professional development, along with administration.  Throughout the school year, teachers will  attend professional development with the DELLSS.    Professional development and supplemental resources will provide methodologies to assist our  students in reading, writing and supporting English acquisition.  ISLA will utilize peer  collaborative teachers to provide teachers with support in implementing the strategies and  model best practices, intervisitations, writing curriculum, lesson planning, and analyzing  student's data.  Some of the supplemental books to be used are the following:  NYSESLAT preparation books,  Read This and Writers at Work. During our team meetings, teachers have the time to plan  collaboratively, and look at students’ work to guide their instruction. This is also part of our  professional learning activities (PLC).  In terms of data, teachers have been receiving ongoing  training looking at student data protocols.  Each department, facilitated by the lead teacher,  presents and supports the department to review and use data effectively to guide instruction and  support student learning.   Using the SIOP model teachers will create content and language  objective focused on students’ needs to  help students realize meaningful connections that exist  among the disciplines.           2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           63      Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact  higher achievement for ELLs.

Our population is faced with  many challenges: poverty, illiteracy, and undocumented status. Just as our students strive to learn  and make a better future for themselves, so do their parents. Parents are not only encouraged to  participate in school activites and events.  Likewise, we would like to support our families in  furthering their education and assisting their kids in the college and career process.  For this  reason we would like to offer the following:   Workshops for Parents – We will continue to provide Navigating the College Process, Financial  Aid Workshops,   and Transitioning your Children to College and Career.  and ESL instruction  for ELL parents. These workshops will be provided by ISLA community and staff  members.  Some of the workshops will educate parents on what their kids are currently learning  in school.  For example, we will provide Pupil Path workshops (our online grading system).   Citizenship Classes – At ISLA our ESL teachers are willing to assist our parents with the  necessary learning tools to learn English and prepare them for citizenship. In the past, we have  offered English classes two days a week for 2 hours each day.  This year, as per parent request,  we would like to add a Saturday morning class.    Our parent computer classes are also held on Saturday mornings.  We will continue these  computer classes.  These classes not only teach parents how to navigate the Teacher Ease and  islaschool.org website, they also give parents the opportunity to learn how to check for  assignments on individual class pages.    Adult ESL Classes began every Monday through Thursday beginning in September.  ESL classes  are provide by Office of Adult Education.  Parent involvement is critical, especially with our long-term ELLs, since they are key in closing  the gap of ESL status and moving forward to true bilingualism. With parent involvement  support, our students have shown greater interest and motivation to continue their  education.  These monthly meetings strengthen not only our students’ academic and social  performance, but also lead to a more dynamic sense of community. Our dedicated parents  ultimately become mentors to others who are new to our school and the community. This  powerful relationship between school board members, parents and students proves to be a great  success in achieving our goal of promotion. With grant funding, the effective involvement of our  parents could continue. Parents will continue to assist in coordinating special events inside the  school and throughout the city of New York.  This will give them the tools necessary to be an  active partner in the ISLA learning community and the lives of their children.  It will also give  parents a voice and participation in their children’s education.  Some of the topics to be covered for parents are Study Skills,  immigration/citizenship  workshops, FAFSA, graduation Requirements, Health and Nutrition, Navigating the College  Process and those requested and identified by parents based on their needs.  In addition, parents  are given ESL classes so that they too can improve their English and support their children.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           64                  Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    Parents are informed and invited to school activities and workshops via School Messenger,  parent letters and flyers (both mailed and backpacked), parent monthly calendars, and on the  ISLA website.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  ISLA uses various assessments for our ENL students.  At the beginning of the year, we administer the ELL Baseline  assessment.  This information is used in conjunction with multiple sources of data (such as previous year's NYSESLAT results)  inform teachers on the areas of focus. The tools used to assess skills are Achieve 3000 Level tests and MLS test for SIFE  students.  In addition, ISLA administers the ELL baseline assessment.  Students take the Achieve 3000 level set assessment in  both Spanish and English.  This assessment gives us the lexile level in both Spanish and English.  Teachers immediately have  this information and can utilize this information to differentiate in the classroom.  The program itself provides differentiated       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           67      reading text at the students lexile level.  Classroom teachers can assign informational text to students and the program will  provide the article at the individual student's lexile level.  The same article is available in Spanish for beginning students, so  that they can be exposed to the article in both languages.  The MLS assessment is administered to students that have been identified as SIFE students.  The exam provides us with the  student's reading level and math level.  This data is utilized by classroom teachers to provide ENL students with the  appropriate supports and/or  programs and to differentiate instruction in the classroom.  For example, SIFE students can  participate in our after school programs in addition to the supports provided during the school day.  Small group instruction in  given to students with low literacy skills in their native language.        2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Through common planning time, examining student work collaboratively, intervisitations, lesson study, teachers discuss and  identify effective approaches to assess student learning.       3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Teachers are always assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of our programs.  In addition to in class formative assessments,  we align our unit assessments to what students are expected to know, understand and be able to do.  We also align our  assessments to our school focus and inquiry focus of writing.  Teacher align across the grade and across content to incorporate  writing into their instruction.  Since students encounter similar strategies in both Spanish (NLA) and English instruction, they  are able to write effectively in both languages.       Our periodic assessment are aligned to the NYC Performance Assessments.  We monitor student growth in their writing  skills.  The EOY NYC performance assessments used showed 148% percent growth in year one of the this assessment.  These  assessments are in English.  In year two (June 2015), ISLA students also improved from BOY to EOY in the NYC Performance  Assessments.  Improving writing skills has been proven to improve reading and literacy skills.  Since the NYSESLAT assesses  Speaking, Listening, Reading and Writing,   our instructional focus helps to improve the two most difficult components of English Language acquisition.           4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    After each marking period, teachers and administration, and guidance conduct a thorough data analysis. Teachers analyze  trends in student performance and discuss next steps. Some of the questions that teachers discuss are:  In what areas were  students successful, and why? In what areas were students not successful and why? Identify root causes of student  success:  List some possible reasons / hypotheses to explain student success in these areas. List some strategies/interventions  you may utilize to address the challenge areas?        5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]    NA        6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The data shows that fewer students are in the entering, emerging and transitioning levels in the 6-8 grade bands.  This may be  because most of these students are coming from other New York City schools.  In this grade band, there are more students in  the expanding and commanding levels.  In the high school (grades 9-12) there are more students in the entering level of  proficiency.  There also appears to be a larger number of students in the expanding and commanding levels.  In looking at the  percentage of ELLs in the past three years, each year, we have more students at higher proficiency level and a lower       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           68         percentage of ELLs.  For example, last year we had 71 % ELLs and this year we have 62.93% ELLs.  The number of students at a  higher proficiency levels and achieving English proficiency is increasing each year.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   At the beginning of the year, teacher are provided the NYSESLAT levels/reports.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Students in the middle school are blocked based on their language levels.  Students in the high school are  programmed based primarily on their academic and content area needs.  Therefore they may be in heterogenenous  (mixed proficiency levels).     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     ISLA will provides TBE classes in grades 6-12.  All ELL students receive the daily requirement of E.S.L instruction as  determined by the LAB R and the NYSESLAT by fully certified ENL teachers. In the middle school (6-8) The entering and  emerging level students receive 360 minutes per week of two units of ENL instruction.  Transitioning and expanding  students receive 180 per week of ENL instruction.  Now, advanced students also continue to receive 2 additional years  of ENL instruction. At the high school  level, ELL students at the entering level will receive 540 minutes (three units) of  ENL; Emerging level students of English proficiency will receive the mandated 360 minutes of ENL per week and  transitioning and expanding receive 180 mins.  Again, students that are at a commanding level in high school also  continue to receive support services for two additional years.  Students in the middle school are blocked based on  their language levels.  Students in the high school are programmed based primarily on their academic and content  area needs.  Therefore they may be in heterogenenous (mixed proficiency levels).  TBE and ENL teachers will utilize  scaffolding and differentiated instructional strategies for increased ENL and content area academic development. The  bilingual classes are provided with a range of literature in English and Spanish instruction in reading and writing.  HLA  is provided to all students for one period a day. In addition we provide 2 bilingually taught content areas.  Teachers  use data from the NYSESLAT, Spanish LAB, school created diagnostic and periodic assessments, and the  NYSITELL create instructional units that will support the academic language development of each student.      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      NA         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              The International School for Liberal Arts, also referred to as ISLA, serves a population of approximately five hundred and  five hundred and eighty.  Our English Language Learners (ELLs) consist of 365 students which is 63% of this population across  grades 6-12. ISLA students come from predominately Latin American country. All our English Language Learners’ are native  Spanish speakers. In accordance with the New York State Commissioner’s Regulation Part 154-2 our students’ educational and  linguistic needs are served appropriately in a Transitional Bilingual Education (TBE) program.  All parents of children at ISLA       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           69      have chosen TBE as their program of choice. Because of the school’s design, where the entire population is Spanish-speaking,  we must provide this method of programming for students. The goal of our TBE program is to enable our ELL students to  develop the linguistic, cognitive, and affective skills they need to function in the school and community at large.  Additionally,  our ultimate goal is to give our students the tools they need to be successful in college.  ISLA will provides TBE classes in grades 6-12. The Transitional Bilingual Program at ISLA consist of 23 classes on all grade levels.  Two 6th grade classes one of them ICT, three 7th grade classes, three 8th grade classes, three 9th grade classes one of them  ICT, three 10 grade classes, three11th grade classes, and three 12th grade.  All ELL students receive the daily requirement of  ENL instruction as determined by the LAB R and the NYSESLAT by fully certified ESL teachers. In the middle school (6-8) The  Entering, Emerging, and Transitional English Proficiency Level receive 360 minutes.  I unit of study in ENL and 1 unit of study in  ENL/ELA with a push in ELA teacher.  The Expanding and  Commanding level students receive 180 units of study in  ENL/ELA.  We provide an additional unit of study to the proficient students to support students with the new common core  ELA exam.   In the high school  ELL students at the Entering and Emerging level receive 540 minutes of instruction based on the Part 154-2.  Students receive 1 unit of ENL, 1 unit of in ENL/ELA with a push in ELA teacher and 1 unit integrated in the content area.  Transitioning, Expanding and Commanding level students receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL.  ENL integrated is done  through co-teaching.  The Native language instruction and English language instruction is fully aligned with New York City’s language allocation  policy.     TBE and ESL teachers will utilize scaffolding and differentiated instructional strategies for increased ESL and content area  academic development. The bilingual classes are provided with a range of literature in English and Spanish instruction in  reading and writing.     This variation requires our teachers to differentiate instruction in order to meet the required  performance standards for the native language (Spanish), English Language Arts, and ESL.  Staff will utilize data from the  NYSESLAT, Spanish LAB, ELE, school created diagnostic and periodic assessments, and the LAB-R to create instructional units  that will support the academic language development of each student.  The TBE and ESL teachers will provide meaningful educational experiences that will allow ELL students to be active participants  rather than passive agents of the language development process.  We have programmed 90 minutes balanced literacy block to  facilitate differentiated instruction to address the needs of our ELL population. TBE and ESL teachers will utilize mini lessons,  independent work, peer tutoring and instructional technology to develop academic and linguistic lessons appropriate for both  the native language and English literacy. Each language will be a separate instructional focus within the school day. English  language development will be further strengthened through English taught enrichment classes such as art and additional ESL  support on a daily basis through our extended day and Saturday Academy programs.        3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      The program model depends on the students level of proficiency. The content area of instruction is delivered in either  Spanish or English. For example, a beginner whose English is covered by 540 minutes would receive all of the content area  instruction mostly in Spanish using the Native Language Usage and Support model; 75/25 model.   Intermediate  students'  instruction is balanced by the 50/50 model. Lastly, the advance students receive mostly their instruction in English  with Native Language Support and/ either the  AP Spanish Language or AP Literature.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      The ENL teachers collaborate with the NLA teachers, as well as the ELA teachers to work on developing assessment based on  their home language. In the content area Social Studies, Science and Math students that are instructed in their native language  are assessed and evaluated in their home language. In addition, NLA teachers expose student to different types of writing such  as descriptive, narrative, argumentative and persuasive.  Students read different Genres and write short responses and essays  in Spanish.              Students are also exposed to reading in Achieve 3000 in both Spanish and English          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           70      We ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their native languages throughout the year because we give them Baseline  Assessments as they enter the beginning of the year, we also take in consideration the students’ participation in class and we  can identify fairly quickly that their abilities are of high standards and we move them to a more advanced level, either the AP  Spanish Language class or the AP Spanish Literature class. We also give them Periodic Assessments that give us another way to  identify their strengths.      In addition, one of our schoolwide instructional focuses is to have students complete projects and  present in their the specific  language of instruction.  Include CCLS Standard Student become accustomed to sharing content knowledge in both Spanish  and English.  In the AP Spanish, AP Literature classes and in ESL classes, teachers mirror many of the activities to those similar  to the NYSESLAT and AP exams.  That is, they have listening passages, speaking/verbal responses, reading and writing  tasks.  Student practice activities in all modalities throughout the school year.  Since teachers meet weekly on the grade, they  also share best practices to support each and students be successful in all their classes.    ISLA teachers and students have also focused on writing for the past three years and will continue to do so this year.  Studies  show that improved writing skills lead to improved literacy skills.  Since all teachers have incorporated argumentative writing  tasks, students see similar tasks and activities and have become familiar with and good at writing.  This year, we want to have  expand their writing genres and be able to identify which writing style will effectively address their writing task.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    A. SIFE Students:  Aside from in class differentiated instruction from the teacher,  The ENL teacher works with our ELA teacher to support the student in the area of writing. Small group instruction on basic  reading strategies is provided to students in both the middle and the high school.  SIFE students also receive daily in-class  support and tutoring in ELA and Math classes and in addition to participating in after-school and Saturday tutorials. We also  organize small group interventions in mathematics and in their native language.    Newcomers:   Content and ESL teachers work on curriculum planning and scaffolding. They are programmed for ENL classes with an ENL  curriculum that supports new language learners, and all teachers utilize SIOP strategies that support beginning students. ENL  teachers also push in to content classes to provide additional support.  For all students (developing, long term and former ELLs) teachers will provide meaningful educational experiences that will  allow ELL students to be participate actively and continue to develop language.  They differentiated instruction to address  their needs utilizing mini lessons, independent work, peer tutoring and instructional technology for both the native language  and English literacy.  Students are provided additional support through our extended day and Saturday Academy programs.           6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Our ELL-SWD participate and engage all the same grade level materials as general education students with the proper supports  according to the IEP and in order to meet their academic goals based on their individualized education program.  Special  Education teachers, ENL,  and content teacher collaborate to  identify and implement supports as described in the student's  IEP.  Differentiation, using SIOP strategies, appropriate to the student’s needs are designed and implemented. This is done  through scaffolding of lessons, front loading of academic and content vocabulary, summary and sentence frames, and graphic  organizers. Content teachers work with ENL and Special Education teachers to ensure students are both developing their  academic language while meeting the demand of the Common Core Learning Standards. The content and ENL teachers also  use ENL glossaries from NYSED for content areas, bilingual dictionaries and assignments are offered in native language in both       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           71      content and ENL classes. Translation services are also provided to the student's family during the annual review of the IEP and  routine monitoring of student progress to ensure that parents understand the progress their children are making.        7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Most SWD at ISLA are educated in an ICT setting.  Those students that are recommended for a special class, separate location  are included in a regular setting in content areas classes where they have stronger academic skills.  For example, some  students may be able to participate in a math class with the special education teacher supports.  If this is possible, the IEP is  modified to include a part time regular setting.   Similarly, they may be included in the Science and/or Social Studies classes,  with support from the special education teacher and as per their IEP.        8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.    The targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, Math and other content areas are small group afterschool intervention  instruction in all subject areas, Saturday Academy, and Credit recovery online programs.  We also provide the following :  •     Homework  help by a native language speaker  •     Extended computer lab hours also with a bilingual teacher  •     Guidance counselor is available for parental outreach and college application support        9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      This year we will be giving our overaged and undercredited students additional support in credit accumulation and Regents  preparation.  We will continue all previous program as in the past.          10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   None     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Our student body is all ELL students and all program are opened to all students.   After school tutoring and homework help is open to everyone, such as: Mathematics, ESL, ELA and Spanish Reading  Intervention.  Extracurricular: After-School Clubs  The College Now courses are open to intermediate and higher students.        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  In the middle school for English and ESL, we use the Pearson: Prentice Hall Literature, Common Core edition, and in the high  school w Houghton Mifflin Collections.  Teachers prepare curriculum maps aligned to their unit of study. In addition,  there is a  central text for each of unit of study.  In addition, we use Achieve3000 an online non fiction reading and writing program.  It  provides differentiated instruction,  engaging students in non-fictional text. It also features comprehensive English and Spanish  language support and extra scaffolding for struggling readers, these are aligned with the Common Core State Standards for  English language arts as well as state standards for literacy and the content.     For social studies, we use DVDs with Spanish subtitles to introduce new topics. Then, we use data based questions to explore  the topic. In addition, textbooks are used to supplement material that is not covered in the DBQs. At the end of each unit,  essays are writing and then peer edited and graded.            2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           72      For the High School, the following supports are in place:  a.     IZONE provides a platform for a variety of technology based resources.  The content in these resources is available in  English and Spanish.  These resources include articles and videos.   Videos and other visual resources through IZONE support  English acquisition.       b.     Students have access to the use of laptops and the internet; in addition to a computer lab.   c.

The  material is interactive and focuses on mathematical investigations. To support our ELLs, the program allows students to  provide knowledge representations in the form of graphs, diagrams, and visuals and symbolic representations. Cooperative  learning is emphasized thus providing them opportunity to develop their BICS and CALP. Further, this program provides diverse  kinds of assessments that inform teacher to plan instructions and parents to monitor heir student’s progress. The CMP3 also  supports our SWDs in terms of differentiated activities through varied procedural and computational techniques.            13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Native language support in our TBE and ESl classes are as follows:  Student have books available in their native language.  In  some classes, students may have texts available in both languages.  Teachers in content areas classes provide students with  translated text, if necessary to support them.  Student also use glossaries and/or dictionaries if necessary.  In some classes,  teachers include a translated presentation so that students can see the classroom lesson presentation in both Spanish and  English.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Administration, Guidance Counselors, teachers and programmers all work together to ensure that students receive all required  mandated services.  In the beginning of the year, administration utilizes ATS reports (i.e RNMR) and multiple sources of data to  ensure that students are schedule to receive the appropriate amount of ESL, HLA, and content area classes according to their  ages and/or grade levels.  All teacher on the grade have weekly grade meetings.  They also review student programs and  transcripts to assist the GC in making sure that students are receiving appropriate ELL services.  In addition, the Assistant  Principal's and Special Education teachers ensure that students receive the mandated services according to their  IEPs.  Guidance Counselor works together with the programmer to program all students and provide the required ELL services  and resource supports.  Within the classroom, teachers that provide services to ELL-SWDs modify instruction based on  students' IEPs goals.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    In the middle school for English and ESL, we use the Pearson: Prentice Hall Literature, Common Core edition, and in the high  school w Houghton Mifflin Collections.  Teachers prepare curriculum maps aligned to their unit of study. In addition,  there is a  central text for each of unit of study.

Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Professional development is provided for all teachers on ELL strategies throughout the school year. ISLA has used SIOP model  for ELLs for the past 4 years.  New teachers participate in SIOP training at the beginning of the year.  Teachers that have been  using SIOP already continue to enhance their methodology by incorporating strategies to increase students engagement and  enhance English language acquisition.       On each of the Chancellor PD days, we incorporate developing language and content objectives, questioning and discussion  strategies, scaffolding strategies for ELLs, and assessment in instruction strategies.     New ENL teachers participate in professional development from DELLS.  In the past all of our teachers, whether new or  veterans teachers have participated in ELLs and the Brains, Math strategies for ELL, Reading Comprehension strategies for ELL  and Writing for ELLs.  These PD sessions are shared with all staff members during our common planning and department  meetings.  In addition,  strategies to help our struggling students and inquiry focus group are shared and implemented by our  inquiry team.     This year, three teachers are currently enrolled in obtaining TESOLcertification in order to be able to comply with the new CR  Part 154 mandated.  Two additional teachers will begin in January.     A tentative profession development calendar is as follows:  November PD- Discourse in Mathematics; Math Conversations; Inquiry and Discussion Strategies for ENLs  December-SIFE Strategies; Close Reading; Improving Reading Fluency; Question Formulation Technique (for new teachers)  January-Collaborative Strategic Reading; More Engagement Protocols  February-Assessment in Instruction; Reading Fluency Strategies  March-May-Continue on Engagement Protocols for ENLs and Assessment in Instruction   Professional development around writing language and content objectives fully aligned to the common core learning  standards will be provided again this year.  We will also continue to support teachers in teaching writing to ELL students that  align to CCLS.  For example, for the past 3 years, ISLA has focused on argumentative writing, which is fully aligned to CCLS and  is also assessed in the NYC Performance Assessment.  We will continue to provide PD on teaching ELL how to writing including  scaffolding of writing task, debate strategies, use of graphic organizers, using textual evidence, etc. Guidance counselors  attend all professional development sessions in-house and also attend outside workshops that focus on the college entry  process, student safety, and dealing with the issues that students face not only as teenagers, but as new young adults in our  country. Our paraprofessionals attend workshops offered by the Office of ELLs.           2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Our guidance counselors have attended professional development on the following:    Immigrant Students and The college Process Supporting Students and their families: Option Institute   Effective Post-Secondary Planning : Supporting Access for all students ( Options Institute )  Strategically Aligning Resources for Students Success  College and Career readiness Benchmark : Preparing ELL Students for Success ( UFT Headquarters a 2 day Training)   College Access for Latino Students ( Conference)  McKinney-Vento Homeless Education Assistance Act-Many of our newcomers may lack a fixed,  regular, or adequate night residence, or may be sharing the housing of others due to being newly arrived in the country or low       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           75         income status. GC assist in providing the support and assistance necessary for these families.  High School GC has attended and will continue to attend college and career readiness trainings to support ENLs in the college  application process.  Likewise our Middle School GC attend trainings to support the high school selection process.  In addition, our guidance counselors attend training to support social and emotional skills so that they can be successful in  middle and high school.   ISLA is a 6-12 school and many of our students remain at ISLA for High School. Therefore we are able  to continue providing support to our students from 6 grade to graduation.     Since we have a population of approximately 70 percent ELLs, all of our PD is tailored around meeting the needs of ELLs.  We  all incorporate and share best practices and strategies to support students.  As an ENL school, 100% of our professional  development is ENL PD.  We adapt every [professional development to meet the needs of our ENL students.  Our in school PDs  include SIOP,  Designing Coherent Instruction to meet the needs of ENLs, Achieve 3000, Engagement Strategies (Danielson 3b),  Writing Language and Content Objectives for ENLs, Meeting the Instructional Needs of ENL-SWDs, Writing SMART goals,  Inquiry Process, And Aligning Resources for Student Success.  In addition, ENL teacher attend professional development  session with the DELLSS.    Our agendas and attendance are maintained either by individual teams in a department or inquiry binder or by administration  in a professional development binder.              Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   In addition to the Parent Teacher Conferences and the mandated parent orientations, the school will schedule individual  meetings with parents to discuss the goals of the program, students' language development and progress, language  proficiency and assessment results.  In most cases, this is done after the student is administered their exam.  The Bilingual  coordinator has individual meetings with parents.  ISLA will also schedule meeting times for parents and teachers throughout  the school year.  These meetings will be scheduled, whenever possible, during the school day.  There will also be evening  meeting scheduled for parents that are not able to attend day appointments.  In cases where several attempts have been  made to meet with parents, every effort will be made to have a phone conference with the parent.  During these individual  conferences, parents will be informed of progress and also be given suggestions and strategies for supporting English Language  acquisition at home.  When necessary, we provide translation services for parents who do not understand English.       2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  Beginning with our initial Parent Orientations (Spring and summer of entering year) and Open School Night in September, we  have various activities throughout the year to foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  This year, in addition to our ESL  classes for parents, we will be providing  Citizenship classes.  Other parent workshops which we have provided and will  continue to provide are computer classes (which include training on our online grading system and now the NYC School  Accounts), Financial Aid Workshops, The College Process, Financial Literacy Workshops and Family Day and Health Fair.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Francine Cruz, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.            2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           78                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   ISLA                                                                              School DBN: 10X342  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      The data and methods used to assess language preferences of the parent community are ATS reports, initial  interview with parents, HLIS form, parent surveys and blue emergency card. At registration, parents complete the  Home Language Identification Survey. Information from all of these sources provide us with parent's preferred  language for both written and oral communication. The HLIS form is part of an entire packet which includes a  registration form and an Emergency Contact Card (Blue Card). An initial interview with parent(s) also helps us to  identify the preferred language of the parent.    The HLIS form is the preferred language form completed by parent(s) upon registration. This is updated every year  by having parents complete and/or update the Blue Emergency card at the beginning of every school year. This  Blue Emergency Card asks for parents preferred language for written and oral communication. The pupil       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           80      accounting secretary immediately updates this information in ATS. This updates the RAPL and the RCPL reports in  ATS.    This information is also shared accordingly with staff members and the blue cards are maintained in the main  office. Although most of our parents prefer Spanish as their mode of communication, surveys conducted at the  school are available in both Spanish and English. RAPL and UPPG (both ATS reports) also provides parents  preferred written and oral communication for ENLs and Non ENLs.    Our school pupil accounting secretary and our Parent Coordinator (also our LAC) are extremely helpful in updating  parent information. They usually ask parents if there is any information that needs to be updated when they come  to the school. We will continue this practice and parents will also be asked if there is any change in preferred  language of communication.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     Language    Spanish   English   -           Written  Preferred        -       --           750  -       20   -   Percent Written    Oral   Preferred    Percent Oral           97.4   2.6   -   750      21   -   97..4   2.6   -   3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.     N/A          Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services    1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be   distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.      Document Name    Month/Frequency Distributed to   How do you plan to translate?

Parent Association Meeting letters, and  all parent workshop letters and flyers   September and monthly for PA  Meetings Monthly   Event letters      Our PC is our LAC. She is trained and  qualified to translate all letters and  documents to Spanish. In addition,  our Spanish language teachers are  qualified to translate any and all  documents. In the event that our PC  is unavailable, they are able to  translate written communication.      The majority of staff members are  able to translate orally for parents  when necessary. Secretary in the  main office is fully Bilingual and is  able to attend to parents in their  native language Spanish.      Some letters (i.e disciplinary meeting  or I.E.P. meeting letters) are  translated and prepared for teacher  use as a form letter. These letters  can be used by entering the  individaul parent name, student  name, and date of scheduled  conference.         *The DOE provides certain letters  and documents translated into nine  DOE covered language. In the case of  any language not covered by the  DOE languages and no staff member  is available to assist in translation,  the school will use a DOE approved  vendor for translation. In addition,  the Language Line is available for  any monlingual teachers that require  oral tranlation in order to  communicate with parents.    LAC translates all written  documents.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           82        Monthly Calendars      Parent Teacher Conference Letters  (including request for one on one  conferences/disciplinary conference  letters)      IEP letters   Parent/Student Handbooks   Student Curriculum/Syllabi   November and March   June, and ongoing throughout the  school year upon admission   Beginning of school year/semester  (for HS)   September and February   Afterschool, extra-curricular, enrichment  activities and trip permission slips   ongoing, prior to events, programs,  trips or activities; as needed   Exam information   as needed on an ongoing basis           LAC provides Spanish version of  Parent/Student Handbook in  addition to the English version of the  handbook.    Syllabi is available to parents in  Spanish upon request.   LAC translates documents.  Permission slips are available in the  main office and can be completed  with specific trip information  (complete blank lines)   Same as above, LAC translates all  necessary documents.   2.  List the formal face-to-face meetings your school will typically have with parents throughout the school year, such as   parent-teacher   conferences or curriculum nights, when they will occur, and plans to provide interpretation at those meetings.        Meeting Name    Month/Frequency of Meetings    How does your school plan to provide   The formal face to face meetings  which we typically have with parents  throughout the year are as follows:      - the initial interview upon  registration      Ongoing throughout the year   interpretation service(s)?    Pupil accounting secretary is fully  Bilingual (Spanish and English). She is  able to communicate with families. In  addition, the PC and GC are fully  bilingual. These are the first staff  members to interact with families  upon registration.          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           83        Many of our teachers, school aides  and staff members are bilingual,  Spanish speaking. If there is a teacher  that is not able to communicate with  the family, which is usually not the  case, then another staff member  supports them.      In the event that a teacher needs to  communicate with a parent in a  language other than English, they can  use the Language Line. If a  parent/parents require translation in a  language other than Spanish or  English, the Lanaguge Line can be used  by the staff member.    individual meetings with parents as  an orientation for first time students   Ongoing throughout the year   Same as above   Parent teacher Conferences and  special request individual parent  conferences.      Ongoing throughout the year   Monthly parent meetings and  workshops   monthly from September to June   Most teachers at ISLA speak Spanish,  so they do not require a translator.  However, in the event that translation  is required, the Parent Coordinator, as  our LAC, is the first point of contact for  translation. The pupil accounting  secretary is also available for  translations. In addition, our Assistant  Principal, Guidance Counselors and  Dean are all bilingual Spanish  speakers.    Our parent Coordinator, Guidance  Counselors, Community Resource  Director and teachers usually present  to students and parents. Bilingual staff  members are always available to  support during all meetings.           3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      Communication to limited English proficient families is accomplished, as mentioned above, via phone messages or  written communication in the parent's native language of Spanish. For example, our School Messenger system sends  messages to parents in case of school emergencies in Spanish and English when necessary. School messenger can also  send Emergency mass messages to all of the parents of our students in their preferred languages.    Our bilingual staff members make individual phone calls to parents in case of individual student emergencies and if  parent(s) needs to be contacted. There is always a staff member available to assist any staff member in the school       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           84      that does not speak Spanish. Monolingual teachers also have the Language Line available for use in order to  communicate with parents if they speak a language other then English. This year we also have the use of iO Education  (formerly Skedula) which has a parent text service. Teachers can send a messages to parents, type the message in  English, and the message will be received by the parent in Spanish or English based on the preferred language in ATS.             Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      On the first professional development day, teachers all receive copies of the relevant Chancellors Regulation A-663.  All staff members are informed of the parents right to receive information in their native language. The staff manual,  also received at the beginning of the school year, also references the parents' right and the school's responsibility to  provide translated information and interpretation when needed. Most of the staff is bilingual and can communicate in  Spanish, which encompasses 97.4% of our parents. Staff members that do not speak Spanish are assigned a Spanish  speaking staff member to assist in interpreting during any meetings, conferences, parent workshops or Open House  events. Prior to Open School Night, Parent Teacher Conferences, and parent events and activites, teachers are also  reminded and any staff member requiring an interpreter is assigned a staff member to assist them. In the event that  no staff member is available to assist monolingual teachers, the Language Line is available for interpretation services.    On November 6th, all staff members will be trained and provided with a langauge line information and phone script to  be able to assist any parent in a language other than English. Our LAC coordinator will also attend refresher LAC  training as needed.                          Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      ISLA fulfills parent notification requirements in several ways:       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           85      -Parents are provided a parent/student manual which includes their notifications, Bill of Rights and Language Access  Guide.    -Parents will receive a notification at the beginning of the year advising them their right to receive all communication  in Spanish. In Addition, this information will be posted in the main office, Parent Coordinator's office, Dean's office  and Guidance's office.   - Letters, brochures and any written communication is always provided to parents in English/ Spanish to provide any  information about the students development and activities.   -Parent engagement documents are translated into Spanish by the LAC, Ms. Lopez, also parents receive phone call via  Phone Messenger about any and all school events and activities.   -All teachers are trained and have the Language Line available to them if they need interpretation for a parent.    -In the event that the LAC is not available, many ISLA staff members are bilingual (including our Native language Arts  teachers, and are fully licensed and able to translate and/or interpret in Spanish.   - Any necessary documents can also be sent to the Translation and Interpretation Unit website, if necessary. We have  not had any need to use this unit in the past. However, this option is available.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       -The school gathers information when parents first register their child in the school. This information is entered into  ATS by the Pupil Accounting secretary. This information is also entered on the blue emergency card for staff to  reference. Blue emergency cards are updated every September and this is also updated by Pupil Accounting Secretary  in ATS.   - The PC provide guidance to families to improve their way of communication with the school community.    -Our office staff is trained to ask parents to update any information when they visit the school.    Office staff will also include requesting any updates in written or oral preference for communication.    -Announcements are made at parent meetings reminding them to update relevant information, including preferred  language. In addition, a parent language survey will be provided to parents in order to get feedback aboiut the  language services provided at the school.    - The school does not have a problem with parents in the communication level because most of the ISLA staff are  capable of communicating in Spanish, which is our primary parent language. Most of ISLA staff is bilingual.              2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           86
