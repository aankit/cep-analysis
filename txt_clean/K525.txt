This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   We take pride in preparing all students to be COLLEGE READY, CAREER READY, and LIFE READY.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.

Edward R. Murrow High School is a non-traditional educational environment. Designated as a “School of Excellence”  by the US Department of Education, Edward R. Murrow High school has a long tradition of offering a wide variety of  courses that are enhanced by high quality instruction (we offer over 20 Advanced Placement courses). Here at  Murrow we also offer a wide range of extracurricular activities in a safe learning environment that helps students  discover their interests as they learn to make their way in the world. We are very proud of the 40 years of educational  excellence that has come to define our community and we are eager and excited to continue our efforts to make  Edward R. Murrow High School the best comprehensive high school in New York City.    “Edward R. Murrow High School is a large community with a small school feeling” (NYC Schools Chancellor –  4/4/2013). Our community consists of individuals who are committed to providing the CARE needed to prepare all  students to be COLLEGE READY, CAREER READY, and LIFE READY (Edward R. Murrow High School was one of twelve  schools featured in last year’s NYC DOE “School Time Lab Report” as a school that prepares students for college and  careers). Our emphasis on improving communication has resulted in a more collaborative atmosphere where all  students are supported as seen in our increase in student achievement. Such improvements in communication and  collaboration have had a positive impact on our students with special needs (18% of our student population) as well  as our English Language Learners (8% student population) as there has been more emphasis on student engagement  in the classrooms as seen in our professional development and teacher team schedule.       This commitment extends well beyond our classroom walls. With a wide range of award winning teams, clubs,  activities and events in addition to our renowned visual and performing arts programs (Edward R. Murrow High  School was featured in last year’s “Annual Arts Survey” as a school that offers exceptional instruction in the arts),  Edward R. Murrow High School affords all students the chance to feel involved and invested in their high school  experience.    … because at Edward R. Murrow High School, we CARE about our students!      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Such improvements in communication and collaboration have had a positive impact on our students with special  needs (18% of our student population) as well as our English Language Learners (8% student population) because  there has been greater emphasis on student engagement in the classrooms as seen in our professional development  and teacher team schedule.       4.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34            IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Edward R. Murrow High School , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I,  Part A of the Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent  involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the  families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision- making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School  Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of  the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Edward R. Murrow High School will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability  grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report,  Learning Environment Survey Report;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Elementary and Secondary School Act;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between /teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

Classes will be held during the months prior to the January and June administrations of the  content-area Regents Examinations in twice a week sessions for six weeks (November 21, 2018 -  January 16, 2109 - Mondays and Wednesdays) and four hour concentrated sessions on four  Saturdays (12/08/18, 12/15/18, 1/5/19, 1/12/19) [spring semester dates to be announced] before  each Regents. The sessions will be taught by licensed content-area teachers with the support of  ENL teachers, bilingual personnel to support home language and Assistant Principals. Classes  will focus on Reading Standards 1 and 10 and Writing Standard 1.   NYSESLAT modality results indicate that Murrow students’ weakest modalities are reading and  writing with most of the students scoring at the transitioning and expanding levels.  All classes  will have a four –skills approach however instruction will focus primarily on writing and  reading.  English Language Learners will also be provided with assistance in mastering the necessary  content skills required for success on the New York State (content area) Regents. To continue to  raise standards, we will also offer intensive Assessment Preparation sessions in: Global Studies,  American History, ELA, Mathematics, Living Environment, Earth Science, Chemistry and  NYSESLAT (spring only). Teachers will use differentiated instruction, Regents study guides,  teacher-prepared materials and NYSESLAT Preparation materials.  Instructors will maintain  attendance records for each session held.   Teachers will use ENL methodologies focusing on listening, speaking, reading and writing. The  Title III program will be open to all ELLs in grades 9 through 12 and will be taught by ENL  certified teachers and content certified teachers. Classes will meet twice a week for two hours  (see dates above).  Skills development lessons will also be infused into the program. Two after  school trips for students will be planned. Notebooks, paper, folders, ink, and classroom supplies  will be purchased for the program.      We intend to use (Pearson's) iLit to improve reading comprehension skills, enhance vocabulary  acquisition and advance writing skills. ilit will enable teachers to differentiate instruction to  accommodate to all levels of students and to help long-term ELLs score commanding on  NYSESLAT.   A support team of Assistant Principals, ENL teachers, Bilingual Guidance counselors will work  together to assess students’ success, coordinate family outreach and offer professional  development.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44         Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.     rationale  teachers to receive training          schedule and duration      name of provider   topics to be covered   Begin description here:             Title III Teachers and Assistant Principals will meet weekly 3pm to 5pm to engage in  professional development in which they will study research-based methodologies and practices  in order to enhance English Learners’ performance in ENL, ELA and content-area classes.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Students are initially assessed by the NYSITELL and in-house exams in math, English and their home language if they opt for the  Chinese or Spanish transitional bilingual program.  In addition, teachers have developed, through teacher teams, base-line  assessments for the courses that they teach.  Data has shown that a large number of ELLs have low writing levels. There is a  school-wide drive to improve writing across all curricula.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Ongoing professional development - Hochman  strategy support     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49         ELL progress is evaluated using using a CCSS aligned benchmark rubric; growth in writing is measured through writing on- demand pieces graded with a CCSS rubric; growth in math s measured by pre and post unit tests within CCSS math curriculum;  State Math Test are also used to measure growth.   AYP data indicates that our ELL students met AYP targets in ELA, math and  science.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Skedula's DDC assessment tool to capture data and monitor student progress.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Paste response to question here:        6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Twenty percent of over the counter ELLs entering Murrow for the first time score in the Entering level on the NYSITELL.  Fifty  percent score at the Emerging level.  On the NYSESLAT,  ELLs in the ninth and tenth grades are the largest populations scoring  at all proficientcy levels.  In the 11th and 12  th   grades the least number of ELLs scored at the Entering level.  The majority  scored at the Expanding level.  Of the entire Entering population 35% are SWDs.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Teacher team meeting and inquiry cycles to share and monitor data while adjusting and modifying curriculum to meet  students' needs.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.               Edward R. Murrow is a large high school that  offers departmentalized instruction, with classes offered four  times a week with a total of 200 minutes of instruction .  Nine periods of instruction are provided from 8:05 a.m. to  2:45 p.m.  All ELLs receive standalone ENL instruction in homogeneous groups according to their proficiency level  following the mandates set forth in CR Part 154.  ELLs also receive integrated ENL- English Language Arts in  homogeneous groups working on materials suited to their particular level, as determined through NYSESLAT.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     In addition to standalone ENL classes and integrated ENL/ELA class, ELLs in the Transitional Bilingual program are also  programed for a homogeneous native language arts class and at least two heterogeneous bilingual content area  classes that meet four days a week for a total of 200 minutes of instruction.   c.  DL program.  If applicable.                      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50                 Content area, foreign language, and native language classes are offered in single period classes (200 minutes per week),          whereas ENL instruction is given per CR Part 154 guidelines.  At the Entering level, two periods daily of standalone  ENL instruction (one double period class) is provided for a weekly total of 400 minutes and one period of integrated ENL/ELA  or       ENL/Social Studies for a weekly total of 200 minutes.  At the Emerging level, one daily period of standalone ENL  instruction is provided for a weekly total of 200 minutes in addition one daily period of integrated ENL/ELA instruction for a  weekly total of 200 minutes.  At the Transitioning level one integrated ENL/ELA class is provided for a weekly total of 200  minutes.  At the Expanding level students receive one period daily of integrated ENL/ELA  or ENL/Social Studies for a weekly  total of 200 minutes.  At the Proficient/Commanding level students are receiving integrated ENL/ELA class for a weekly total of  90 minutes for two years after being designated as former ELLs in addition to receiving 200 minutes of weekly ELA instruction.          At the beginning of the school year, all ELLs are reprogrammed based on spring NYSESLAT scores, and students admitted  thereafter are placed according to their NYSITELL score.  Eight semester levels of native language arts instruction in Spanish  and Chinese are available for all students in the transitional bilingual education programs.       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      Instruction in every department is guided by established course outlines that are aligned to the Common Core Learning  Standards  and reflect Regents skills development.  In the transitional bilingual programs, instruction is delivered in the  students' home language and English, decreasing the use of the home language as the students' English proficiency  improves.  In the standalone ENL program, delivery of instruction in the content areas is in English with a special emphasis on  English language development.  Bilingual dictionaries and content area word for word translation glossaries are  available.  Furthermore, tutoring is offered in every subject and students are continuously referred by teachers or encouraged  to participate.  Differentiated language instruction and development is addressed in all disciplines.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      Research shows that students with strong academic skills in their own language acquire proficiency in the second language  more quickly. As required by CR Part 154 guidelines, Edward R. Murrow offers native language arts to ELLs in Russian, Chinese  and Spanish.  These classes develop and maintain students' literacy in their native language.  ELLs are evaluated in their native  languages through formal and informal classroom assessments that include an initial baseline assessment and additional  assessments that are developed according to student needs.  The Chinese Reading test and the Examen de Lectura en Español  (ELE), are given annually.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    The SIFE status of ELLs is determined upon intake, based on prior educational history and students are recommended, when  pertinent, for a variety of support services.  Such services may include participation in the after school ENL academy, ENL   instruction, tutoring (individual, small group, and peer), and/or academic support from the ENL teachers.      Newly arrived students and those who have been in U.S. schools less than three years are scheduled for all the required  classes per the level and grade they are placed in.  This is determined by the NYSITELL score, when admitted, and by their  home country school transcript. The three guidance counselors (Mandy Hung, Charlyn Sanchez and Anna Umanskaya) keep  track of student progress and collaboratively with teachers recommend academic interventions, as needed.  Academic  interventions available for all newcomers, as well as all other ELLs, include participation in Peer Tutoring and the after school  ENL Academy.  Parents are continuously informed through hone calls, mail, and Pupilpath of the academic progress of their  children.      ELLs who have been receiving services for 4 to 6 years and Long-term ELLs, are scheduled for all the required classes according   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51      to  their score on the NYSESLAT and their academic grade progress.  Guidance counselors keep track of student progress  and collaboratively with teachers recommend academic interventions, as needed.  Academic interventions available for all  ELLs include participation in Peer Tutoring, Homework Club, Regents prep and the ENL after school academy.  The  LAB/BESIS coordinator also works in close collaboration with the testing coordinator to ensure that ELLs taking Regents  Examinations are given all the allowed accommodations.  The World language department keeps word-for-word dictionaries  to lend to students while they are taking Regents Examinations.      General performance of ELLs reaching proficiency on the NYSESLAT is monitored by guidance counselors.  Proficient/Commanding ELLs are offered tutoring in room 281. They are given appointments during each semester to  conference with their guidance counselors regarding their progress and achievement.  They also select classes for the next  semester.  The after school ENL academy offers a four hour preparation course for ELLs and for students who have  tested Proficient/Commanding on the NYSESLAT.  Additionally, every semester prior to Regents administration time, the  Assistant Principal of Programming submits lists of former ELLs to the school testing coordinator, for testing accommodations  to be provided.  All testing accommodations for former ELLs are provided during the two years after proficiency has been  achieved.          6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   To support learning, teachers use Universal Design for Learning principles of differentiating instruction for all students  identified as special needs ELLs. Teachers use the following instructional strategies to increase student engagement and  understanding of   content:  • Scaffold questions and activities to match the student’s readiness level  • Provide real life examples when discussing readings or concepts  • Provide students with test and classroom accommodations such as having work or tests read orally, extra-time, dictation etc.  • Model activities  • Use technology (Smart boards, Brightlinks, Document Cameras & Laptop computers) to engage students in learning visually,  auditorily and kinesthetically  • Provide visuals (photos, pictures, gestures) to support academic work  • Provide graphic organizers, rubrics, and templates to assist in completion of classroom activities   • Incorporate alternative assessments in the form of projects, presentations, drawings etc.  • Provide native language support to bilingual students in the classroom (Alternate Placement Para)  • Incorporate pre-reading activities to stimulate prior knowledge  • Encourage re-reading of tasks/instructions  • Provide more time to finish assignments/tests  • I-lit to provide literature at students reading levels.  • After school academy to work on building literacy skills  • Constant checks for understanding  • Teachers provide student-centered learning environment  Group work and pairing activities are frequently used        7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  To enable students to achieve their IEP goals, all ELL students who read significantly below grade level are programmed for  ENL classes which focus on phonemic development and decoding skills along with another ENL class.  All ICT or SETSS students  receive ENL services in the mainstream through mainstream ENL class. ENL students who are classified as having a  Speech/Language Impairment also receive Speech Services.  Teachers are encouraged to add visuals to their presentations to  help ENL students associate words to pictures. All lessons are aligned to the Common Core shifts which include teaching  academic vocabulary and using non-fiction sources. Teachers include word study in their lessons including word-  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      meanings,  origin, and roots of words. Our ENL teachers have professional learning community time with content area teachers  to ensure that curriculum is modified for all students to access including ELL-SWDs      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Through Title III funds and a Long-term ELL Grant, Murrow offers a variety of academic interventions for ELLs, they are: an  after school academy to provide support in organizing for study, completing homework, managing time for study and  academic guidance; after school Regents Prep for ELLs scheduled to take Regents Exams, provided by content licensed  teachers;ELLs have access to after-school programs at Edward R. Murrow High School to supplement their learning. After- school classes are held and are broken up into groups based on their areas of weakness; these areas are assessed by previous  NYSESLAT scores. Students also have this class in place to have Regents exam review as well. These classes are held twice a  week for two hours and the class focus is on the appropriate exams (ELA Regents in January/June, NYSESLAT in March/April)  based on the time of year. Students work on reading skills (beneficial for both the ELA Regents and NYSESLAT exams) and  speaking skills (beneficial for the NYSESLAT), and are required to write answers in an attempt to assess and build  comprehension and writing skills . Teachers provide feedback.  The feedback they are given by the ENL teacher is helpful in  assisting students understand where their strengths and weaknesses are; understanding the teacher is an assessment of a  student's listening skills (beneficial for both the ELA Regents exam and NYSESLAT).            9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      There will also be additional professional development for teachers to access and interpret results from the NYSESLAT to help  develop MOSL targets and drive instruction.  Furthermore,  professional learning opportunities will be provided to develop  best practices for integrated ENL strategies. A team of teachers were trained in collaborative strategic reading and will turn key  this training to staff.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   All current programs and services for ELLs will be continued due to their success. Changes will be made based on effectiveness  and student need.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs.  Before and after school during the week, ELLs can participate in any  activities including SING!, theater programs, stage crew and costuming. ELLs can attend Regents prep classes in all disciplines.  ELLs are also offered the opportunity to begin a club if one does not exist in the area that they wish to explore.         12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Textbooks and leveled readers are purchased regularly for ENL and content area classes.  In addition,  there lap top carts and  tablet carts available for students.  Each classroom is equipped with a Brightlink or a Smartboard.  Laptop carts are also  available for classroom use as are computer labs and the library.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   As research indicates that students with strong academic skills in their own language tend to acquire proficiency in the second  language more quickly, and as required by CR Part 154 guidelines, Murrow offers NLA (Native Language Arts) to ELLs to  develop and maintain literacy in their own language.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Achieve3000 responds to student performance by adjusting work according to grade level.  An entering ELL, may find material  on a first-grade reading level. This level will increase as they improve their English proficiency.  ALL materials are purchased  through vendors specifying age-specific texts and grade-specific texts.  All materials are screened and must be found to be age- appropriate before being used in all content areas.  Material which are high interest but low-literacy are sought for entering  and emerging ELLs.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Textbooks and leveled readers are purchased regulary for ENL and content area classes.  In addition,  there lap top carts and  tablet carts available for students.  Each classroom is equipped with a Brightlink or a Smartboard.  Laptop carts are also  available for classroom use as are computer labs and the library.      16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   In collaboration with the Office of ELLs, a summer program is offered for list noticed junior high school students.  Also, there  are courses offered after school for beginner ELLs.  Small group, one-on-one, and peer tutoring is available in all the subject  areas during the school day. The After school academy offers  four hours of weekly assistance.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Italian, French, Spanish, Russian and Chinese classes are offered.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?            Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  During the current school year, a wide variety of professional development will be offered. Edward R. Murrow provides  professional development to content area teachers, and teachers of ELLs who do not have bilingual certification. Participating  teachers receive support at meetings and in the classroom on strategies and methodologies pertaining to teaching content to  ELLs and developing English language in the content area. Professional development is provided by the Instructional Assistant  Principals, and lead teachers and are scheduled throughout the school year.  Workshops are open to assistant principals and  bilingual/ENL teachers. Assistant principals, bilingual/ENL coordinators and teachers participate in all and any professional  development provided by the Department of ELLs. During Chancellor's Professional Development Days in the fall and spring,  professional development is provided to comply with the 7.5 required Jose P. training hours. During these all-day professional  development initiatives, workshops for paraprofessionals working with ELLs are scheduled and provided by staff teams.  In  preparation for summer school, all teachers participate in professional development on ENL strategies and methodologies  prior to the beginning of the summer.  ENL Department Conferences are open to teachers of all departments.  During these  meetings, all participants receive information, professional development and training pertaining to instruction for English  Language Learners.  Periodically, ENL teachers attend department meetings and professional learning offered by content area  departments.   Teacher teams meet regularly for teachers of the integrated ENL/social studies classes to discuss best practices  to develop language through the content area.  Teachers of ELLs develop lessons that reflect Common Core Learning Standards  and curricula during PLC time.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Teachers of ELLs meet on a regular basis to develop instructional and socio-emotional strategies to assist ELLs as they  transition from middle school to high school.  Guidance counselors hold meetings and provide professional learning on topics  that include bullying and the socio-emotional affect of ELLs.  Also, peer mediators are available in the home language to  resolve conflicts.   Edward R. Murrow's  Professional Learning Plan, indicates that at least 15% of the professional development for all teachers is  dedicated to language acquisition and best practices for integrated ENL/content area co-teaching.  In addition, for bilingual  and ENL teachers a minimum of 50% of the professional development hours is set aside for language acquisition aligned to  core content area instruction and integrated ENL/content area co-teaching strategies.  Records are kept for professional  development activities in the Principal's Office.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Parents are invited to see their child's guidance counselor annually for an individualized meeting to discuss each student's  progress towards language acquisition in English and their home language if applicable based on language proficiency  assessment results, and credit accumulation in ENL, native language and content areas.  ENL teachers and TBE teachers are  invited to participate in these meetings.  Interpretation and translation is provided by bilingual staff or when not available  over-the-phone with the Office of Translation and Interpretation Services.         2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Specifically for ELL parents, an ENL meeting is offered in the evenings on an ongoing basis.  Also, newcomer and ELL related  topics are presented in workshops designed for ELL parents.  In addition, two major activities are the annual International Food  Fair and the College/Career Fair for ELLs.  Both of these activities encompass the school community by involving parents, staff,  and students of ELLs and non-ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Allen Barge, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Edward R.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Upon arrival to Edward R. Murrow High School, a trained pedagogue assists parents with completing the Home  Language Identification Survey (HLIS) to determine if they are eligible to be tested for ESL services. This is part of  the enrollment procedure when all students arrive at the school. The Pupil Accounts Secretary maintains all of the  documents, except the HLIS, and hands them to the parents to complete; the assigned pedagogue will meet with  the parents for the first time to explain the HLIS and its significance. The assigned pedagogue explaining and  assessing the HLIS is RoseMary Iervasi, ELL Coordinator. Pedagogue will ask the family if they prefer to see the  HLIS in their home language, and she will accommodate the family with the survey that is available on the  Department of Education's website. Further, the trained pedagogue will look to the school faculty and staff to  assist the family with the informal interview, if needed. When a student indicates on the HLIS that they speak a  language other than English, or that they communicate with their families in a language other than English, the  student will meet once again with the trained pedagogue for an informal interview to determine final NYSITELL  eligibility. The students are encouraged to participate in this interview. Interpretation will be coordinated within  the school for this interview, if the family is unable to participate during the interview. Interpreters are first   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      sought throughout the school. Since this meeting will eventually involve academic progress during a conversation,  Edward R. Murrow High School adheres to Chancellor's Regulation A-663 even during the initial assessment and  inform the family of the regulation. .   Among the paperwork that must be completed, parents are given the Parent Program Selection Form so that they  can indicate which of the three programs offered their preference for their child is. Once the parents complete  this survey, the trained pedagogue goes over the survey with them. In the event that the parent selects a program  that is not Freestanding ESL or Transitional Bilingual Chinese or Spanish (the programs currently offered at E. R.  Murrow High School), the pedagogue explains that Murrow will open a bilingual program for their language once  there are 20 students who speak the target language in one grade (for example, 20 Polish-speaking students in  the 9th grade) who also elect to be in one of the programs (Dual Language or Transitional Bilingual Education).  Parent Surveys are done immediately to prevent issues with return of the Parent Survey and Program Selection  Form. If the forms cannot be completed during enrollment, parents will be called to come in to complete them.  Parent Survey and Program Selection Forms are kept in the student's file. A record of the parents' choice is filed in  the Home Language Identification Survey.    A review of the school demographics revealed that of a total enrollment of 3927 students, 275 (7%) are identified  English language learners (ELL). Through an assessment of languages represented in the RHLA (Home Language  Report) report in ATS, we found that the population at consists of students who speak more than 49 different  languages. Only 47% of students indicated English as their home language.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.

Murrow uses  translation  funds to pay  translators at  parent- teacher  conferences,  orientations  and  informational  sessions.       Any assistance that parents require is addressed at Murrow High  School and all measures are taken to ensure that parents are given  correspondence in their native languages. Para-professionals in the  school participate in parent meetings, when needed, and the ATS  system that is used for student and parent information allows  Murrow High School to send letters and documents to parents in  their native languages. All official documentation can also be sent to  the Department of Education Translation and Interpretation Unit,  should all options within the school be exhausted.   Data regarding home languages can be found using the ATS system  RCPL; reports that indicate home language and/or place of birth help  us direct all correspondence with parents. It should be noted here  that although a student may pass the NYSITELL and will not require  ENL services, the school will still send correspondence and  accommodate parents who speak a language other than English, if  this option is exercised by the parent. The ATS system will clearly  show the difference; the home language and the parent's preferred  language are on two different screens within ATS. Parents are also  encouraged to contact the school when information has reached  them that is not in their native language. Every effort is made to  accommodate parents within the school, and the Translation and  Interpretation Unit is consulted when additional help is needed.  Parents are also made aware of their options in seeking translation  and interpretation.            3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.

Special procedures are in place to provide all parents who are not able to understand English translation and  interpretation services necessary to ensure equal educational opportunity for their children. From initial enrollment,  when students first come to our school, to parent meetings, workshops; and interviews with school personnel,  parents will be provided translation and interpretation services by school community members who speak their  language and understand their culture.   The Bill of Parents’ Rights and Responsibilities is distributed in the school’s top five languages and English at the  beginning of the school year. All school documents are translated into Chinese, Spanish, Russian, Arabic and Urdu.  Information on availability of interpretation services through the Parent Coordinator and Guidance Counselors are  posted prominently throughout the school lobby, school hallways and the Main Office area. School staff has been  made aware of translation and interpretation services, and are able to guide parents and visitors to the designated  staff members and offices where services are available. Calls from parents who do not speak or understand English  are forwarded to the World Language Department that contacts an interpreter to provide assistance. During PA and  Leadership Team meetings, parents attending are reminded of the DOE website link that provides information on  their right to translation and interpretations services. The monthly Parent e-amil lists a permanent notification of the  availability of translation and interpretations services, as well as the notice regarding parents’ right to such services.    All parent notifications, mailings, forms and documents will be translated in as many languages as possible. In addition  to the five most common langauges represented, whenever possible, written translation of parent notifications will be  done into other languages, such as Arabic and Uzbek. Translated documents will be kept on file, updated when  necessary and available as needed.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       Parent surveys and feedback forms are distributed at parent workshops. In addition, links to online surveys will be  made available on the school website. Mass emails, that are automatically translated into the parents preferred home  language,through Skedula are also used.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65
