This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   PS 72 adheres to the philosophy that student learning is hands-on, inquiry-based, differentiated and academically  rigorous. Our school-wide focus for 2018-2019 is: Readers will develop a bank of strategies and skills to foster  comprehension across genres and culturally diverse resources. This philosophy also rings true in our Mission  Statement.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      PS 72 Staff will ensure that all students receive engaging, rigorous, and differentiated instruction. We will set high  expectations for success and prompts students to think deeply through questioning, inquiry, and application of  knowledge. We will ensure students’ learning is monitored through on-going assessment and self-reflection.         2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    PS 72 is a barrier-free PK-5 elementary school located in the Throgs Neck area of the Bronx.   Classroom instruction follows the workshop model and the gradual release of responsibility of learning to the student.  The Literacy Block covers units of study that are integrated with grade specific Social Studies and Science content.  Mathematics instruction has been consolidated into modules to deepen the learning and understanding of fewer, but  critical areas. Instruction follows a constructivist approach to learning; utilizing manipulatives and authentic learning  contexts. PS 72 is the District 8 site for Gifted and Talented program and has expanded its program to include 2nd  grade for the 2018-2019 school year..      PS 72 prides itself on our expansion of the arts. We partner with the following CBOs.     Education through Music: school band, small group instrumental lessons, gr. K-5 general music instruction    Dancing Classrooms emphasizes etiquette and respect, as well as, dance instruction in merengue, swing and   tango to name a few to gr. 4 students     CASA Broadway provides a resident artist to produce a Broadway themed performance with students    Direction for Our Youth Out of School Time provides visual and performing arts components as part of their   afterschool program      In addition to our partnerships, we offer the following activities and student led committees.   Student interest surveys determine school-wide clubs, i.e. art, basketball, Zumba       Morning Announcement Team  "Helping Buddies" community service    Student Hallway Monitors (NPFH)    "Just Say Hi" program      The Inclusion Project    Wellness Council  Student Council        The social and emotional welfare of each of our students is of the utmost importance. We support the development  of the whole child with available guidance and supports. For the past nine years, we have partnered with the Anti- Defamation League’s No Place for Hate campaign. Each year, a student-led committee organizes events that promote  tolerance and anti-bullying. For the 2018-2019 school year, we will expand the RULER program to students and  families, which is provided through the Center for Emotional Intelligence at Yale University. RULER is integrated with  our PBIS program.     Three school-wide projects    Annual school-wide anti-bulling march in the community    ADL Gold Star status for the past eight years   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10     RULER-Center for Emotional Intelligence, Yale University         In order to expand learning experiences beyond the classroom, PS 72 has partnered with New York State Senate  Project BOOST. This program provides the necessary funds to allow groups of students to take school trips to enhance  and further classroom learning. During the 2017-2018 school year, students visited Taste Buds Kitchen, Circle Line,  Patricia's Restaurant, Broadway to name a few.      In order to enhance the delivery of content area instruction, PS 72 continues to partner with the New York Historical  Society Museum and Library. NYHS educators and classroom teachers work collaboratively to deliver an enrichment  program curriculum that is aligned with the NYCDOE Passport to Social Studies. The focus of the curriculum is utilizing  primary source documents and artifacts.      PS 72 prides itself on its school-wide bridge theme. Six years ago we expanded the school motto to include special  projects, curricular connections and a metaphor to build our community. Each grade adopts a bridge that is  connected to their scope and sequence of instruction. For example, 4th grade adopted the Brooklyn Bridge, which is  connected to the history of the United States through New York. Each January, we hold our annual Bridge Expo, which  showcases the bridge projects that were completed during the Winter recess. Classes and families are invited to tour  the exhibit.      PS 72 is The Bridge to Success. As a school community, we build bridges together. We build bridges to understanding,  discovery and achievement. This is our school-wide theme. We cross the Bridges to Success with effort and diligence  to meet our goals, which lead us ultimately to college and career readiness.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   PS 72 is barrier-free, and can accommodate students with mobility issues, such as wheelchairs and walkers. 26.83% of  our students have IEPs. Forty-four percent of IEP students are in self-contained Special Education classes, 30.7% ICT,  and 9.21% receive related services only. PS 72 boasts an ethnically diverse student population as well. 68.66% of our  students are Hispanic, 22.18% Black, 4.65% White, 4.12% Asian, 49.8% male and 50.2% female. These factors make  for a dynamic learning community.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   On the 2018 NYC School Survey, results indicate that teachers provide inclusive classroom instruction by modifying  instructional activities and materials and delivering appropriate instruction for English Language Learners and Student  with Disabilities. According to our 2014 Quality Review, our teacher team collaboration is Well Developed. Teachers  participate in reflective dialogue regarding looking at student work and the planning and preparation of instruction.  Throughout the remaining five components of the framework, the following can be identified as strengths:  implementation of the Common Core shifts in Literacy and Mathematics, safety and welfare of students and staff,  providing social-emotional supports for students, communication of high expectations to students and staff and  parent trust in the principal.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS 72, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student  Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the  connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed  to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of  their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and  Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      PS 72 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability  grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;      provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State   accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality  Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;     host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1st of each school year to advise   parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right  to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118  and other applicable sections under the ESSA;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49         schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the  morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the  Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between /teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.         School-Parent Compact (SPC)   PS 72, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA),  is implementing  a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and  the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I, agree that this  Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for improved academic  achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure that all children  achieve State Standards on assessments.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50            Provide high quality curriculum and instruction consistent with State Standards to enable participating children to  meet the State’s Standards and Assessments by:   I.

The goal of our program is to prepare our ELLs to  achieve proficiency in the English Langauge and grow academically and socially.  Based on the  data of the NYSESLAT results from the Spring of 2018 and the results of the 2018 State ELA  test, we have observed that our English Language learners have demonstrated a common area  which needs to be improved. These areas are: reading comprehension, increase of academic  vocabulary and developing writing skills. The focus of the ENL After School Support Program  will be to further build comprehension skills, increase academic language and vocabulary, and  improve students writing. The entire ELL population are welcomed to participate in this  program. Two licensed ENL teachers co-teach and differentiate student instuction by providing  small group instruction based on each childs needs. The students are placed into groups  according to their Fountas and Pinnel independent reading level and English Language Proficien  cy level (as per the NYSESLAT). Students will show significant growth in each of the four  modalties: Listening, Reading, Writing and Speaking. This program will occur twice a week on  Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:30 to 5:30pm. The program takes place for a few months in  the school year. Licensed ENL teachers will continue to use the Leveled Literacy Intervention  program (LLI), by Heinemann. This program was purchased with Title III funding. This program  also uses the Fountas and Pinnel Intervention as a measure of student learning. The LLI Program  targets every reading level through guided and shared reading practices. The program is designed  for English Language Learners in addition to any other student in need of extra support. This  intervention program begins at level Pre-A and continues up to Level Q.  The structure for the  small group instruction will consist of one group utilizing the LLI program with a licensed ENL  teacher. The remaining students will be placed in a group with another ENL teacher where they  practice and develop language using different computer based programs such as: Imagine  Learning (which is at no cost to Title III funds), BrainPOP ELL (which is purchased using Title  III funds) and i-Ready.  These programs integrate technology with language acquisition and  keeps the students engaged. The Imagine Learning computer based program is designed for our  ELL and SWD population. The i-Ready computer based program is a school wide program  which targets the students specific areas of need in literacy and phonics. The groups alternate  between technology and small group instruction using the Leveled Literacy Intervention  program. The BrainPOP ELL program supports and encourages the language development of our  English Language Learners using engaging videos and introducing new vocabulary words  students can add to their language word banks. Both imagine learning and BrainPOP ELL are  enjoyable and rigourous programs by which students are able to participate and proceed at their  own learning pace. ENL teachers monitor students' progress through printing out assessments  and other forms of student work designed to meet each student's individual needs. Teachers will  be able to confer with each of the students personally. Individual Progress Reports will be  available to further monitor each students progress. These reports list the students areas of  strength and areas in need of improvement. These reports also provide recommended academic  vocabulary for the student to study. Work based on the information from these reports can be  reinforced as homework or classwork.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56               Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information           Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.     rationale  teachers to receive training          schedule and duration      name of provider   topics to be covered   Begin description here:             To professionally develop our ENL teachers and classroom teachers with a high concentration of  English Language Learners in their classrooms, we have purchased calendar days from Teachers  College which focus on effective instructional practices for ELL students.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  PS 72 uses the Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment to guide instructional planning for our English Language Learners.  We also use the Teachers College Reading and Writing Project curriculum-embedded assessments (checklists, conferring.)  Other formative assessments used include: questioning, discussion, graphic organizers and visual representations. In addition  to these resources, we have recently begun to use the Spring Forward by Benchmark Education Company paired with the  Anchor Comprehension Workshop by Heinmann which also provides additonal assessments (graphic organizers, questioning,  visuals etc.)     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The structures in place to support this effort are determined by the data from the results of the assessments listed above.  These results are used to support the classroom teachers, ENL teachers, and the AIS teachers. The Fountas and Pinell  Benchmark Assessment identfies the student's reading level. Guided reading groups and independent reading materials are   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      established based on these levels. The Teachers College Reading and Writing Project provides checklists in the students home  language (when available) and toolkits for small group instruction. This supports conferring specific to ELL needs. The Spring  Forward/ Anchor Comprehension Workshop by the Benchmark Education Company allows us to pre-assess, monitor student  progress and confirm the mastery of student skills. This kit can be applied to whole group and small group instruction. Using  these resources supports instruction and makes planning more effective to meet the individual needs of our ELL population.  The data provides insight to the reading levels, vocabulary knowledge, phonemic awareness, and reading comprehension in  English of our ELLs.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The summative assessments that are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need are: The New York State  English as a Second Language Achievement Test (NYSESLAT), the English Language Learner Baseline Assessment (for grades 3- 5), the Beginning of year Assessment (BOY), Measurement Of Student Learning (MOSL) exam from the previous year, the  Fountas and Pinell Benchmark Assessment System. Ongoing communication with the parents and classroom teachers is  conducted to track and monitor progress and areas of need.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    The data acquired from the different assessments are used to help determine which instructional standards to focus on as well  as to evaluate the ENL program. Once the data has been gathered, it is used to monitor student growth in the four modalities;  reading, writing, listening, speaking. The NYSESLAT results allows for us to determine areas of student strengths and needs.  This information is also used to drive instruction and target each modality as needed. This data is also entered into the  Education Data Analysis tool (EDAT) which allows us to monitor and track student progress and trends throughout the year.  The information uploaded to this tool is taken directly from ATS which provides an accurate indication of individual student  data. Using this tool, along with the data collected from our different assessments, we are able to drive instruction  effectively.  This information is also shared with the classroom teachers. We also use the English Language Learner baseline  assessment (grades 3-5) to identify the students strengths and weaknesses. It provides rubics to assess performance across the  different facets of the modalities. The results are used to differentiate instruction to address the needs of our ELLs. Students  are given listening exercises to prepare them for the NYSESLAT, improve their listening skills and encourage students to self- assess their comprehension. A student's home language is used when newcomers need help to understand different problems  in content areas such as Science, Math and Social Studies. We support newcomers in their home language with the use of the  Google Translate application via different technologies (i.e iPad.) The BOY assessment is administered at the beginning of the  year and presents a baseline for classroom and ENL teachers to support effective planning and instruction. The MOSL is a  yearly assessment to better understand our student's strengths and how to support their learning development. The Fountas  and Pinell Assessment System is administered throughout the year. The results provide information about the text level  suitable for the student. This enables us to select texts that will be productive for instruction. There is ongoing communication  between the ENL teachers, classroom teachers and parents to support student learning.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]      The ENL teachers work together with administration, support staff and classroom teachers to ensure that students are  receiving the best quality service. The results of the NYSESLAT and other assessments are shared with teachers, support staff  and administration. The AIS team also shares the results of the students Benchmark Literacy Assessments. These tests  demonstrate the students strengths and the areas of need which will be utilized to plan for effective instruction. The results  indicate that students in need of support in listening comprehension usually work well with simple TPR commands and  repetition. When working on writing with English Language Learners, teachers focus on the grammatical and phonemic errors  of English. When writing, students practice basic sentence formation (i.e. What makes a complete sentence?) ELLs are granted  many opportunities during instruction to engage in conversation during the reading workshop or partner talk time which  supports their oral language development.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61         6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The outcome assessments data that are used to evaluate and inform our ENL program are the NYSESLAT, NYSITELL, ELA State  Exam, Math State Exam, and the yearly MOSL. This data is uploaded to the ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT) using the information  from various ATS reports (RLAT, RESI and RNMR.) This tool displays the different trends and patterns among ELLs and how they  have progressed throughout the year.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The data patterns acquired from the EDAT presents ELLs strengths and needs across the modalities; reading, writing, listening,  speaking. The data is uploaded into the EDAT from ATS and is utilized to plan for instruction. The assessment scores uploaded  into the database include: NYSESLAT, ELA, Math and Science scores. Based on this data, ENL teachers are able to target areas  of strengths and needs across the grades and implement effective instruction to meet those needs as well as support the areas  of strength. Data from the 2016 NYSESLAT reveal that students scored higher on the Speaking portion of the test across the  grades. Due to these results, the speaking development of our ELLs are expected to continue to increase as the year  progresses. An area of need that the ENL teachers will be focusing on this year will be Writing. The results of the 2016  NYSESLAT show that in grades K-2, students scoring low in writing was 6, and in grades 3-5, students scoring low was 12; this is  significantly lower than scores in the other modalities. ENL teachers will work together with classroom teachers using the  Teachers College Writing program to support student growth in this area. The yearly MOSL (Measurement of Student Learning)  is also an assessment that is used to identify and target key components to promote student learning. Students in grades K-2  tend to acquire listening skills as well as speaking skills through the use of poems, chants, other rhyming patterns as well as  phonics. Visual aides help increase vocabulary knowledge. Our newcomers, regardless of age, need immediate support in all  four modalities. Upper grades 3-5 students are in need of increasing their reading comprehension and organizational skills in  writing. This data has proven to be a reliable source of information when planning for instruction and meeting with classroom  teachers, support staff and administration.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   In the Freestanding ENL program, ENL teachers provide standalone and integrated instruction. In the standalone  instruction, students are picked up from their classrooms and escorted to the ENL room. Here they receive support  targeted to their language needs. The students are divided by grades between two ENL teachers. ELLs are placed in  the same class per grade when possible. For each grade, students are grouped for standalone instruction with the ENL  teachers by proficiency levels. ELLs with disabilities are placed in academically suitable groups as per their IEP/504  plan to meet their needs. The Entering and Emerging students are serviced 360 minutes per week, the Transitioning  and Expanding students are serviced 180 minutes and the Commanding students are serviced 90 minutes per week.  The Entering and Emerging students receive 4 periods of standalone instruction per week; the remaining 4 periods are  provided as integrated instruction. During standalone instruction, ENL students are picked up from their classes and  escorted to the ENL room by the ENL teacher for small group instruction. The ENL teachers go into the classrooms to  support and provide instruction to learners for integrated services. The Transitioning, Expanding and Commanding  students receive integrated instruction during the week to meet their required minutes. Within integrated instruction,  ENL students are grouped heterogeneously, in pairs or triads with native English speakers and/or a bilingual student  to encourage the development of oral language. An iPad with the Google Translate application is provided to students  with limited English proficiency. This application allows students to translate the content presented in over 90   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62         languages. Students can translate anchor charts, checklists, worksheets and pages in workbooks. All ELLs receive  services based on their mandated minutes and areas in need of support.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A. TBE program not available at this time.   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A. DL program not available at this time.   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   The school ensures that the mandated number of instructional minutes are provided according to proficiency levels in each  program model by allowing the ENL teachers an opportunity to create and modify their schedules. The ENL teachers provide  the minutes of instruction for all of the ENL students. ELLs are serviced based on their proficiency level; the proficiency levels  are determined by the student's scores on the NYSITELL/ NYSESLAT. The Entering and Emerging students receive a total of 360  minutes (8 periods) per week. Four of the eight periods of service are administered as standalone instruction per week; the  remaining 4 periods are within intergrated instruction. The Transitioning, Expanding and Commanding students are serviced  during integrated instruction during the week to meet their required minutes of 180, 180, and 90 respectively.         3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   The ENL teachers and classroom teachers of ELLs work together to incorporate and implement ENL strategies into their lesson  planning and instruction. ENL teachers use the Bilinugual Common Core Standards to plan effective instruction suitable to  meet the needs of our ELLs. These standards provide expectations of ELLs at the proficiency levels for every standard and  grade; this has proven to be exceedingly beneficial for planning. PS 72 utilizes the New York State Common Core Standards and  Teachers College Reading and Writing Program school wide to drive instruction. The Teachers College model is comprised of a  mini-lesson structured to include a Connection, Teach (whole class instruction), Active Engagement, Link, Independent Practice  and Share. ELLs are given the opportunity to engage with their peers throughout the lesson through partner talks. They are  supplied with the resources such as anchor charts, checklists and other materials in their home language when available.  Students who speak low incidence languages (such as Arabic and Portuguese) are provided an iPad programmed with the  Google translate application ready for use. This application allows students to take photos of charts, workbook pages and  other materials, and have it translated into their home language instantly. Students are taught to operate the application and  are able to independently utilize it when needed. This has proven to be effective with our students in grades 3-5. During the  Independent Practice time, ENL teachers are able sit and confer with a small group for more targeted instruction and  reteaching if necessary. Within the Share, students can be informally assessed on what was learned. This model of instruction  provides structure for all of our students, but more specifically helps us to support our ELLs in all content areas; differentiated  instruction is provided based on language needs.  The ENL teachers use scaffolds such as modeling, activating prior knowledge, using video clips, manipulatives, repetition and  visuals to assist the ELLs in building comprehension and mastery of the content. The use of graphic organizers is another  scaffold to make text and discourse comprehensible. Other scaffolding techniques that are implemented are consist of  questions that guide students to the answers and glossaries that define words and phrases important for understanding the  text. This gives students ample opportunities to use content-specific and general academic vocabulary before, during, and  after reading.  The 100 Book challenge is another program offered at our school where students read independently to increase stamina and  fluency during an allotted period of time. At the end of the week, students who have met the required steps receive an award  medal which motivates them to pursue reading. In all academic areas, we are conscious of the vocabulary that we teach our  students, especially our ELL population. Many of the classrooms have a print rich enviornment where objects in the room are  labeled.  The Fountas and Pinnell Assessment helps guide the teachers to plan and drive instruction on each students reading level. This  is another support from which the ELLs benefit. Professional development has been put in place to support our teachers using   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63      Total Physical Response (TPR) together with more concrete teaching tools, such as photographs, picture cards and Tier 1/2/3  word walls. Many Tier 3 words support ELLs in content areas. The use of SMARTboards has also been effective in providing  additional audio and visuals.   In Mathematics, we use the new GoMath! curriculum to instruct in mathematics. This curriculum is also available in Spanish to  support our Spanish speaking students. Teachers provide support for ELLs by using visual representations and providing hands- on manipulatives to make abstract concepts comprehensible. This math intervention has proven to be very successful with our  students and utilizes a hands-on approach. Ipads ready with the Google Translate application are also available to support  language learners who speak low incidence languages (i.e Arabic, Portuguese.)  Teachers in grades K-2 use Wilson's Fundations Curriculum to build phonemic awareness as well as building a foundation for  reading and writing. This program has supported our early emergent readers, students with special needs and English  Language Learners; this also greatly supports our SIFE population. The other content areas (Social Studies and Science) are  taught as interdisciplinary subjects to Literacy and Math. We incorporate non-fiction reading into our Literacy instruction.  Additionally, all ENL teaching strategies are applied to these subjects. Teachers use Interim Progress monitoring to assess all of  our students and are particularly aware of the needs of our ELLs and SWDs     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   PS 72 does not currently have bilingual classes in place at this time. Due to this, we do not formally evaluate our ELLs in their  home language. However, the Spanish LAB is administered once in the year when a student is initally identified as an ELL with  the home language of Spanish. Students with a home language other than Spanish are not given a formal assessment, instead  they are given a bilingual book which (English and their home language, when available) to identify the students reading  behaviors. Students are also given a sheet with pictures and words in their home language where they can identify the word  with the object, to see if the child is literate in their first language. We encourage bilingual and parents limited in English toents  to read with their children at home to further build comprehension skills.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    6a. SIFE students are supported using visual aides, Wilson's Fundations program for phonemic awareness and Imagine  Learning Computer Technology with the ENL teacher. The AIS teachers also work with these students using the Fountas and  Pinnell Leveled Intervention kit.  6b. Newcomers are instructed using visual supports, i.e. picture cards, SmartBoard, iPads and bilingual picture dictionaries. The  Imagine Learning Computer Program is also  available in many  of the students' native language. 6c. ELLs who are receiving  services for 4 to 6 years are provided AIS instruction as well as Imagine Learning technology based support.6d. At this present  time, we do not have Long Term ELLs in our school. Continued support would be provided through the Imagine Learning  Program and AIS small group support aligned to the students' reading level to Long Term ELLs. These students would also be  invited to participate in PS 72's Saturday Academy program in additon to the ENL After School program.  6e. Former ELLs receive ELL modifications on State Exams after their first two years of achieving the Commanding proficiency  level on the NYSESLAT. The ENL teachers continuously monitor the student's performance by conferring with the classroom  teachers. These students are also invited to participate in the ENL After-School Program for extra support. The students also  have the opportunity to utilize the Imagine Learning computer program and attend the Saturday Academy program.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   ELL-SWDs are provided with scaffolds and supports to provide access to academic content areas and accelerate English  language development. The use of visuals, iPads, manipulatives, counting charts and graphic organizers are some of the  scaffolds that are used with our ELL-SWDs. The ELL-SWD students receive the same content as the non-ELL/SWD population.  However, the instruction is differentiated; both in integrated and standalone sessions to better support our learners.  Teachers target reading comprehension skills, inferring, critical thinking, building vocabulary and developing their writing skills   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64      through small group instruction. Teachers apply these scaffolds to target the students needs in read alouds, shared reading,  guiding reading and interactive writing. During math, all students use manipulatives, as well as an interactive word wall and  flash cards to encourage math vocabulary. The Imagine Learning computer reading programs are also utilized and allow the  ESL teacher to monitor student progress. Extensive use of visual aides, TPR, rhyming words, and chanting are applied to  address the needs of our ELL-SWDs.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  PS 72 uses curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and attain English  proficiency within the least restrictive environment. ENL teachers provide differentiated instruction during integrated and  standalone time to provide students the opportunity to grasp the content. Teachers implement the use of scaffolds such as  graphic organizers, visuals, manipulatives, videos etc. within the ELA and Math curriculum to further enhance the development  of oral language. ENL teachers meet with classroom teachers and administration to discuss student progress. During this time,  different approaches are discussed to modify instruction to effectively meet the needs of our learners. ELL-SWDs performance  and instructional needs are monitored by the classroom teachers and the IEP team. Students are grouped according to their  needs and corresponding level-range so that they may succeed in a least-restrictive environment.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  PS 72 offers a variety of targeted intervention programs available to ELLs, including ELL-SWDs, in the core content areas of ELA,  Math and Science. Among these services are: Academic Intervention Services (AIS), ENL Afterschool Program, ELA Saturday  Academy and Math Saturday Academy.  Academic Intervention Services are delivered to English Language Learners based on their needs. AIS is provided as a  standalone service. Students receive service based on results of the Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark reading level and ongoing  teacher assessments. Since our ELLs are grouped heterogeneously, all of the subgroups are grouped together in mixed classes.  Students are also granted the opportunity to take part in the ENL After School Program which supports students oral language  development in the four modalities and prepares them for the NYSESLAT. During this time, students have the opportunity to  further improve their language development using the computer based Imagine Learning program. All ELLs have access to  Imagine Learning. This program is continuously available to our ELLs and is offered in more than one language. At the start of  the program, students are able to transition from their home language (when available) to English. This enhances the essential  skills and strategies required for reading success. In addition to being used in the after school program, Imagine Learning is also  used as an intervention during the regular school day. This program has proven to be noticeably beneficial to SIFE students as  it promotes early literacy skills such as letter recognition, phonics, reading comprehension and vocabulary skills. This program  allows students to build confidence in the English language as they are introduced to new skills at their individual pace.  Another advantage to this program is that we have noticed the Entering and Emerging ELLs transition more productively when  presented the opportunity to use the computer. All the required services and resources correspond to our ELLs ages and grade  levels. Throughout the year, Saturday programs are available to support all students in ELA and Math. ELLs are encouraged to  participate in this program for extra support in not only the content areas, but their language development as well.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Based on data and trends, the Teacher's College Reading and Writing Project will be implemented throughout the school. The  ENL program will begin to utilize Spring Forward Benchmark Education and Anchor Comprehension Workshop by Heinmann. It  is expected that these programs will improve the reading and writing skills of our students.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A. We do not have a bilingual program available at this time.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65         ELLs are included in all programs. PS 72 offers DFOY (formally known as OST), which serves as a supplemental service. This  program takes place after school and provides homework help and recreational time. It is offered to all students including our  ELLs. It must be noted that this program is on a first come first serve basis. Student clubs, Casa Broadway (a theater program),  and Dancing in the classroom are other programs available to our ELLs     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Materials used to support ELLs learning include: Imagine Learning, Smartboards, myON, iReady, tiered word walls, and  bilingual picture dictionaries, Google Translate, graphic organizers, anchor charts (in home language and English), GoMath! in  Spanish, Science books in Spanish, Leveled Literacy Intervention Kit by Heinmann, Spring Forward by Benchmark Education  Company and iPads.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   We do not currently have a DL or TBE program available at our school. Within our ENL program, home language support is  offered by providing content area instructional books in the home language paired with an English copy (when available.) We  also have a bilingual and monolingual library of books to read for pleasure across reading levels. ELLs are also grouped in pairs  or triads with students who are proficient in English and/or are bilingual. This not only supports ELLs in their language  development but also encourages their peers to assist their classmates.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    PS 72 ensures all required services/ resources support and correspond to ELLs' ages and grade levels through the Teachers  College Reading and Writing Project curriculum that is being implemented throughout the school. The TCRWP provides age  appropriate books, charts, visuals and checklists. Books that our students enjoy and comprehend are also available . The ENL  teacher reinforces what is being taught in the classroom during integrated instruction.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    N/A. PS 72 does not share a building.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   PS 72 does not offer activities to newly enrolled ELL students before the beginning of the year. Materials, such as the PS 72  handbook are offered in the home language of the families as an additional support. The PS 72 website is also available for  translation and provides information such as weekly events, in the students home language.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?     N/A. We do not offer electives to ELLs.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A. Dual language program not available at this time.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  PS 72 provides professional development for all ENL personnel at the school. Workshops are provided through the Teachers  College Reading and Writing Program, Bronx Borough Support Center, Fordham University and in-school (PLs). During in-school  professional learning sessions, staff are informed of ENL strategies and how they can be implemented in the classroom with  ELLs. New terms regarding the mandates for our ELL population are also shared at staff meetings. Throughout the year, The  Teachers College Reading and Writing Project has provided workshops specific to ELL needs. These workshops have been  beneficial to the ENL teachers and teachers of ELLs. At these workshops, resources, essential strategies, scaffolds and tools  were shared. In utilizing these resources and strategies teachers have been able to meet the needs of ELLs more effectively.  Other Professional opportunities are offered in forms of conferences and meetings in other schools and regional offices. The  Bronx borough Support Center has also offered various Professional Learning opportunities pertaining to teaching practices  and compliance. New York State also offers workshops with Key Note Speakers of ELLs through Fordham University.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  As per CR Part 154.2, PS 72 meets the professional development requirements via workshops offered through the Bronx  Borough Support Center. ENL teachers attend ELL meetings offered by the District. Additionally, ENL teachers attend other  workshops and programs offered by the Department of English Language Learners throughout the school year. The  information received from these workshops is shared with other staff members. Classroom teachers, special education  teachers and ENL teachers receive professional development during the Chancellor's Conference Days and/or any additional  professional development days.             Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   The ENL teachers contact parents and caregivers via telephone or email. Parents are invited to individual meetings during  Tuesday afternoon Parent Engagement time after 2:30 PM; this is offered every Tuesday.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   PS 72 provides resources for parents such as the "ENL for parents" classes which takes place on Tuesday and Thursday  afternoons. An orientation for parents of ELLs is provided in the beginning of the school year. Special events to celebrate  holiday and cultural events take place throughout the year. Parents are encouraged to volunteer at the school. Notices and  phone messages regarding reminders and attendance are available in the home language (when available.) Translators are  provided for meetings, workshops and school functions per request.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Margarita Colon, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Dr. William P.
