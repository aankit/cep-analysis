This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   At PS 377, our mission is to empower all students to be critical thinkers, problem solvers and compassionate leaders,  who embrace cultural differences, encourages others to meet their potential and develops their own self-awareness.  Through collaborative efforts of parents, the community, staff and students we will develop a culture of analytic  thinking, social intelligence and a love of learning which will assist in creating future leaders who will make a  difference in today’s society.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   PS 377 is a brand new school that opened its doors in September 2017 in the Centerville section of Ozone Park, New  York. We will be a 3K through 5 school but currently we have four classes of 3K, six classes of Pre-K, three classes of  Kindergarten and first grade. At PS 377, we believe that all students have the capacity to lead and aspire in their  school community and beyond. Each student has the power within themselves to see and reach their own potential to  be successful in a changing world. As a school community, we will respect one another, put forth our very best, take  responsibility for our actions, and find the positives in everyday life.    The implementation of the “Leader In Me” transformational process has been an area of accomplishment that PS  377Q is most proud of. This initiative has created a culture of leadership, trust, and community. We have incorporate  the Seven Habits of Effective People into all elements of our school culture. This includes student curriculum, school- wide events, parent workshops, and staff professional development. We were extremely gratified by the social- emotional growth that our students have made. Students have acted as leaders. They have grown in confidence, and  autonomy. Pre-Kindergarten and Kindergarten students currently lead the school during morning announcements and  have identified ways that they are a leader. Furthermore, they have created school-wide displays and videos that  share elements relating to the Seven Habits.    The parents and staff have also embraced the “Leader in Me” philosophy. Parents have participated in interactive  workshops and have been a driving force behind the school’s success. The staff have also created lessons that  incorporate the habits with literacy skills being learned. Furthermore, a Book of the Month has been integrated into  the curriculum. The school has also provided professional development that bridges the elements of the “Leader In  Me” process with the best practices for teaching and the Danielson Framework for teaching.    PS 377Q has also begun a partnership with Columbia University's Teacher's College. We have successful implemented  the TC Reading and Writing Program in Kindergarten as well as the New York City DOE units of study in Pre-  Kindergarten. Furthermore, the students participate in Common Core aligned math lessons as prescribed by New York  State Education Department on the Engage NY website   The Integration of the Arts into the PS377Q curriculum has been a highlight for our school. Students and their families  have the opportunity to appreciate and create various art forms throughout the year. Students have explored various  mediums and have produced pieces of art that highlight their individuality and skill. Furthermore, the children’s work  was celebrated during our first Annual Art Show that transformed our gymatorium into a spectacular Museum of Art.  Furthermore, the visual arts also provided an avenue for the parent-school connection. Families participated in Paint  Night and experience that joy of creativity. Drama and music was also incorporated into our curriculum, were  students acted as performers and as the audience in many theatrical performances.    Throughout this school year, we have seen our school grow and flourish. We believe this is due in part to our amazing  school community and the journey we are taking with the “Leader In Me” and our Teacher's College Family.      Expectations for the children and teachers:   Students are expected to be active participants in their learning. Through questioning and discussion, students will  explore various centers and learn to think creatively to solve problems. To foster independence students will reflect  on their own learning, as well as, have opportunities to share their ideas and offer feedback to one another. Students  will be expected to contribute to an environment of safety, respect and trust by learning to appreciate the differences  of others and to celebrate the accomplishments of everyone.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Teachers’ responsibilities will be to make learning experiences investigative and fun-filled for children so they see  school as a place where there is excitement and joy in learning. While accomplishing this the teachers will utilize a  backward design model for planning, organizing and implementing instructional aligned to the Common Core State  Standards. Through goal setting and actionable feedback, we will assess and monitor the progress and make the  revisions necessary to insure every student is learning. Not only will we provide parents with information regarding  their child’s academic and social emotional progress, but we will also encourage and welcome parental involvement  as partners in supporting student learning.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   26% of our population are students with special needs. The classification of our students include hearing impairment,  Speech/Language Impairment, Learning Disability, and autism. Many of our students are in need of a Committee on  Special Education and guidance counselor services. We have a team on call who visits on a need basis. The Special Ed  Liaison will prepare for and attend IEP meetings of children initially referred to special education. Our Guidance  Counselor is here 1 days per week and counsels children and leads parent workshops. 25% of our population is English  Language Learners and they range from entering to expanding and Commanding.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Area of Celebration:   Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.   It is our belief that PS 377 made the most progress in the creation of a supportive environment where students feel  safe, supported and challenged. Our school has implemented initiatives and inclusive opportunities throughout the  school year. The "Leader In Me" transformational process was introduced and the school community was involved in  events that celebrated the accomplishments and unique contributions of all the members of the school community.  Student-led conferences were conducted twice a year and parents were invited to collaborate with their teachers  during Topic Tuesday events. Students were also highlighted during morning announcements and on the school-wide  "Leader In Me" video. Overall, a culture of trust and support has been established at PS 377.    Area of focus:   Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High  standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing  critical thinking skills.   Public School 377Q will continue to focus their attention on providing rigorous instruction, which includes rich  discussions and lessons that promote critical thinking and problem solving.

Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 377, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.         Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   P.S. 377 will support parents and families of Title I students by:     providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level,   e.g., literacy, math and use of technology;     providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and      decision making in support of the education of their children;  fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress;     providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;     sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and  in languages that parents can understand;     providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and  other members of the school community;      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.   In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:      actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s  Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of  the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;     Title I Priority and Focus Schools and the parents of students served in the Title I program must jointly agree  upon the use of these additional funds to support increased parent engagement/education to enable parents  to effectively support their child’s learning.     engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated   directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;     ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and      strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the  Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing  technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;     maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and  families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the  assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school  environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of  events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.;  conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational  accountability grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and  support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;        provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State   accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality  Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;     host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1st of each school year to advise   parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right  to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118  and other applicable sections under the ESSA;  schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the  morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the  Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions;  translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;              Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:     holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40           hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school   year;     encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-  Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee;  supporting or hosting Family Day events;       establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;    encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;    providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their   children’s progress;     developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about   school activities and student progress;     providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between /teacher and the home in a   format, and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.   School-Parent Compact (SPC)   P.S. 377, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is  implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between  the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I,  agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for  improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure  that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Our school uses the NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, Teachers College Reading and Writing Project, Go Math Fall/Spring Benchmarks,  EngageNY Exit Slips, Fundations, teacher-created exit slips for all subjects, and Passport to Social Studies Pre-Assessments to  guide instructional planning for our ELLs. The data received from each individual allows us to provide the supports needed for  our ELLs in terms of all four modalities (listening, speaking, reading, and writing). When the students enter the school year,  they are given the NYSITELL, which provides us with the students' proficiency levels when entering the particular program,  which then allows us to provide the appropriate supports the child may need depending on his/her level, and allows us to  differentiate appropriately. This information is also provided by our pre-assessments and benchmarks, given at the beginning  of the year.  GoMath Benchmarks are given to each student to gain insight about the students' skills in math. With these  assessments, the teacher is able to provide the student with what he/she needs, and is able to appropriately guide  instructional planning for our ELLs. At the end of the year, the students are given the NYSESLAT, which provides us with  important information about the students' growth throughout the year.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   All staff at P.S. 377 work together to create an environment that supports all students. As a grade level, the teachers work  together to provide the best supports for their students. Within our school, Google Drive is used as a place to keep all  documents used throughout the school year, such as assessments, benchmarks, worksheets, etc. Each and every person of the  school is an active member is creating an environment that supports the growth of each and every student.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  P.S. 377 uses the NYSITELL and the NYSESLAT to identify baseline, progress and areas of need for our ELLs.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once the summative data has been gathered, each grade comes together to discuss specific student goals and what we can do  as teachers to achieve those goals. Groups are formed within the classroom based on their levels in the class.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]        6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The NYSESLAT is used to evaluate and inform our ELL program in our school. By understanding where the students are  academically at the end of the year, we are able to provide the supports needed for the following year.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?               Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   In our school, our ENL teacher is in the classroom all day with a General Education teacher. She is able to provide the  appropriate supports needed to our ELLs all day. Within the freestanding ENL program, students are grouped  heterogeneously. The levels range from Entering-Expanding. Instruction is delivered as required under CR Part 154.2.  Our entering students receive 360 minutes of ENL instruction per week, where 180 minutes is integrated ENL  instruction (ELA), and 180 minutes are standalone ENL instruction. Our emerging students also receive 360 minutes of  ENL instruction per week, with 90 minutes being standalone ENL instruction, and 180 minutes being integrated ENL  instruction. Our transitioning students receive 180 minutes of ENL instruction per week with 90 minutes being  integrated ENL instruction, and 90 minutes being standalone ENL. Our Expanding students receive 180 integrated  minutes per week. Lastly, our commanding students receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL instruction a week.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   ENL instruction is delivered as required under CR Part 154.2. Our entering students receive 360 minutes of ENL instruction per  week, where 180 minutes is integrated ENL instruction (ELA), and 180 minutes are standalone ENL instruction. Our emerging  students also receive 360 minutes of ENL instruction per week, with 90 minutes being standalone ENL instruction, and 180  minutes being integrated ENL instruction. Our transitioning students receive 180 minutes of ENL instruction per week with 90  minutes being integrated ENL instruction, and 90 minutes being standalone ENL. Our Expanding students receive 180  integrated minutes per week. Lastly, our commanding students receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL instruction a week. The  ENL teacher is in the classroom all day with a General Education teacher, therefore she is able to provide the appropriate  supports for all ELLs throughout the day, ensuring the number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency  levels.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Core content is delivered in English. When it is possible, translations are provided for our students by bilingual staff or  translators.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   In the beginning of the school year, our Spanish-speaking students take the Spanish LAB to test for Spanish proficiency.  Throughout the year, the students are provided with translations in their native language when needed. The students can also  access the Go Math and EngageNY worksheets/assessments in their native language.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:                                                                                 School DBN:   Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
