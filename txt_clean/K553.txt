This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Our mission is to provide   Section 4: CEP Overview      support and structure for students who are over aged and under credited. Our mission is to support the academic and  social emotional needs of our students through collaboration with all share holders, and the engaging of students  academically through literacy with an emphasis on post secondary and college and career readiness.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9               2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Brooklyn Academy High School is dedicated to educating students who have fallen behind in credit accumulation  through a personalized approach to learning. Our teachers have the common belief that all students can learn given  support and a nurturing environment.      Demographically we are 45.93% male and 54.07% female, 22.22% Hispanic, 2.22% American Indian, 74.81%African  American and .74% Multi-Racial. Our students range in age from 16 years old to 21 years old and come to us having  completed at least one year of high school. We strive to have our students plan for post secondary readiness with a  college and\or career plan. To this end our CBO CAMBA is very instrumental in providing our students with a Learn To  Work Program and students are offered paid internships. CAMBA also provides on site training in writing resumes,  dressing for an interview and interview protocols.. CAMBA also provides 5 advocate counselors, 1 internship  developer, and a Social worker to help students with the many challenges they face.      Teachers College C`olumbia University provides 4 psychologist interns through their Fieldwork Practicum Site  Agreement who assess our students for emotional and behavioral disorders. They use a variety of approaches to help  our students navigate personal issues and conditions.       Students at Brooklyn Academy attain college credit in History and English Language Arts through our collaboration  with Berkeley College. These courses are offered at Brooklyn Academy and taught by Brooklyn Academy Teachers.    .            3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Brooklyn Academy has 26.67% of students with IEP's and classified as Students With Disabilities. Sixty eight percent of  our students are under credited, this is largely due to poor attendance. Our students are faced with many  social/emotional issues and over 15% have a mental health diagnosis. About 20% are diagnosed with a chronic health  issue. Our students face many challenges including parenthood, but are still in school attempting to complete  requirements for their high school diploma.         4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      During the 2016-17 school year, our graduation rate was 70%. We did make great improvement in providing rigorous  instruction, we need to make a greater effort in improving rigorous instruction across all content areas. Teachers  worked in their departments looking at student work to improve instruction, discuss student needs, and provide  meaningful feedback but there is room for improvement in all three areas.   Our 2017-2018 PPO celebrated our culture of mutual trust and positive attitudes that supports the academic personal  growth of students and adults. We also make strategic organizational decisions to support our school's instructional  goals and meet the learning needs of students. Resources are used to support the goals of the school including  coaching for math teachers and PD focused on areas identified by school data. The data shows a need to continue to  have professional development on Danielson domain 3 across all subject areas to allow for consistency.   This year we will continue to explore the work that we are doing to meet the varying skill level of students. We will  review teacher pedagogy from a coherent s of beliefs about how students learn best informed by the instructional  shifts and Danielson Framework for Teaching. As a school community we will work together to improve the level of  rigor in the classroom and increase the level of student engagement. Students will also become partners in their  learning with conversations and meaningful feedback from teachers that will inform both teacher and student. This  wok will be aligned to the CCLS rubrics.   As a school teaching community we will review our common understanding of differentiation of instruction, and  identify two or three strategies that teachers can use to differentiate instruction and work in their classrooms.   To meet these goals we will participate in the Transfer School Institute for the second year. We will use baseline  assessments and argumentative writing and student/teacher conferencing to guide in differentiating lessons to meet  individual student needs. We will also be working with a Professional Development Specialist from Creative Solutions  to assist us in addressing our areas of need. Teachers will be engaged in inter-visitation so as to showcase best  practices.                        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 13K553   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   157   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Brooklyn Academy High School works with students on an individual basis, and pay close attention to their academic  and social emotional needs. Our students get the support necessary to help them in meeting their graduation  requirements, post secondary college and career readiness. We want to create a school where all students are  supported academically, challenged to be the best they can be, where they become critical thinkers, and move on to  become productive citizens.      Our last Quality Review cited the following accomplishments:      There is an atmosphere of high expectations where all teachers believe building student content mastery through  rigorous instruction will lead to student success in career and college. There is a curricular coherence and alignment  across content areas that promote college and career readiness for all students. Curricular and academic tasks are  refined using student work. Administration communicates high expectations to all staff through frequent cycles of  observations and feedback, and a system of reciprocal communication. High expectations are messaged to students  and parents through continuous communication, such as telephone outreach to families, and academic and social  emotional support services offered through the community supports.      Across classrooms, teaching practices are aligned to the curricula and informed by the Danielson Framework for  Teaching. Teaching strategies are consistent in providing multiple entry points into the curricula for all learners.   Teaching practices include the use of a variety of graphic organizers, leveled texts, the Bloom/Depth of Knowledge  questioning ladder, conversation starters, work models and intentional groupings.      Teachers in all content areas engage their students in a school wide initiative to improve writing skills across curricula.  Shared practices such as citing textual evidence are implemented in the majority of classrooms, there is also evidence  writing across curricula during class lessons, posted on bulletin boards and in student portfolios.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13         When looking at our progress reports school report card and Quality Review, we know that we must develop teacher  pedagogy from a coherent set of beliefs about how students learn best. This will be informed by the instructional  shifts and Danielson Framework for Teaching, aligned to the curricula, engaging, and meets the needs of all learners  so that all students can produce meaningful products (1.2).      Within the needs assessment we have identified areas that we must continue to improve. Those include:      Developing teacher pedagogy from a coherent set of beliefs about how our students learn best.      Consistently providing access for all and accommodating all learning styles in all classrooms and at every lesson.      Improving student lead classroom discussions, leading to student writing pieces.      Engaging in structured professional collaborations in teams using an inquiry approach that promotes shared  leadership and focuses on improved student learning.       In the school year 2017 2018 we were invited to become a member of the Transfer School Institute. Our focus was to  improve our assessment and feedback cycle. The focus group for this learning experience was our ELA teachers. ELA  teachers also had the opportunity to visit Professional Pathways High School to be a part of the conversation on  students conferencing. Conferencing protocols were designed and used with students, all was aligned to the CCLS  writing rubric. The conversations with students allowed for informed lesson planning that included differentiating for  individual students. Students became very comfortable with the rubric and with assessing their own work. Students  were able to set academic goals for themselves and know the progress they are making based on their conversations  with their teachers. This work will be introduced across all curriculum areas in the upcoming school year.      Our Math teachers were invited and became a part of Algebra for All for the school year 2017 2018. This collaboration  has not shown increases in the Regents scores June 2017 83% and June 2018 50%. What id did schow was students  getting credit for the extended questions, This shows that students are building stamina and drawing from strategies  learnt to attempt these questions. We will continue our collaboration with Algebra For All.         To develop teacher pedagogy we will establish an instructional development protocol for usage during Collaborative  Planning Time, which all core content area teachers have with their content area one period every day.

This will be built into  the CPT protocol and monitored by administration. Administration will provide PD for teaching staff on how to define  rigor and how to scaffold effectively. PD will also be provided on looking at student work .      Our school's MOSL for 2016-2017 was effective. This is due in large part to our success in our college and career  efforts. School Year 2016 2017 Brooklyn Academy recorded 15% of students receiving college credit from courses  taken and 35% enrolled in college or post secondary program within 6 months of graduation.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.      By June 2019, Brooklyn Academy High School will ensure that 70% of students will improve their writing skills by at least  one level. This will be accomplished by rigorous instruction and with bi-weekly one on one teacher students conferences  designed to provide each student with individualized feedback and support.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional  development, and/or systems and structures needed  to impact change.  Strategies to address the needs of students with  disabilities, English language learners, and other high- need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited,  SIFE, STH).      Under the guidance of Eskolta and the Transfer School Institute  we will increase our work with conferencing in all content areas.  Conferencing tools will allow teachers to conference effectively  and give meaningful feedback. This work will allow students to  know their current level and what they need to do to move  along the continuum.   Teachers will meet in department teams and with the use of the  equip student work protocol, analyze student work from a task  within a lesson or unit to establish task alignment with the  targeted CCLS. Teachers will also provide suggestions for  improving the task and related instructional assessments,  noting how it might inform instruction.    We will continue to have students meet with CAMBA advocates  for college and career readiness.

What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  A study of our NYC School Survey indicates that we work very hard at providing a supportive environment for our  students where they can grow both academically and emotionally. In our last Quality Review, students shared that  they receive support from their teachers in establishing their goals and in the college search and application process.  Within the culture of support at Brooklyn Academy students are "reconnecting to their academics." Students are  made aware of their learning goals and supported to meet college readiness expectations. In our community of  support, parents shared in the Quality Review that "This school is very supportive to parents and students. The  students and the parents have access to the teachers anytime. It is a great place."    The faculty and staff at Brooklyn Academy recognise that we must continue the work of supporting our students with  their ever changing needs. It becomes very difficult to fully accomplish that with our students who are chronically late  or absent, and whose living situation is compromised.   In looking at attendance trends our attendance percentage was 68% for school year 2017-2018 an increase of .05%  from the previous school year in spite of all the interventions in place: late phone calls, absentee phone calls, home  visits, guidance interventions, parental conferences.   Currently advocate counselors from CAMBA meet with students for social and emotional support. Our social worker  and guidance counselor also counsel with students on a weekly basis. Psychologist interns from Teachers College at  Columbia University are also provide counseling services to our students. Our attendance continues to meek weekly  to look student attendance and interventions such as home visits, and parental/student conferences are made.   Our needs assessment has found that the most significant factor that helped to improve attendance with students  was student mentoring, and the impact made in developing a supportive relationship with an adult at our school. We  will continue these practices to increase attendance by 5%.

"This school is very supportive to students and parents. The students and parents have access to the teachers  anytime." This is a wonderful testimony given by one of our parents at our Quality Review, It is a true indicator of the  commitment of our teachers. In addition to the Quality Review, the learning environment survey also shows that our  teachers work very hard at promoting a supportive learning environment for our students. We received well  developed on establishing a culture for learning that communicates high expectations to staff, students, and  families,and in providing supports to achieve those expectations   All teachers at Brooklyn engage in inquiry based professional development. The work of the inquiry team and peer  learning circles has allowed teachers the opportunity to share best practices and promote instructional coherence.  Teachers have adopted strategies such as chinking for both the writing process and to support students with complex  texts.    Teacher teams consistently use protocols for looking at students work and analyze current students thinking against  the desired goals. Two inquiry teams conduct frequent analysis of student work using a common tuning protocol.  Teachers describe that the inquiry process provides them with additional opportunities to discuss instructional  practices and strategies to improve student achievement. Teachers also provide each other with feedback and shared  strategies and tools to support students.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs.

Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. 13K553, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       Brooklyn Academy will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home, for general education, special education  and English Language Learners.   ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  During our orientation process students are given an assessment in writing and in Math. From this data, we have found that  the majority of our students are coming to us under their grade level in Reading and Writing and instruction is designed  around this. We look at the results of this along with their test exam history from ATS and the results of their Regents exam.  This data helps us to assess the students' needs and the interventions that are necessary      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Teachers grade the assessments, and the data is shared among all faculty members. Teachers are then  well aware of the  needs of the students,and this information allows for lesson planning that addresses those needs.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46         It is extremely difficult to evaluate this as the sample size has been very small in the last several years (less than two students).  If we had ELL students, we would look at the number of classes taken and passed, performance on Regents exams and on the  NYSESLAT exams to evaluate the success of our programs for ELLs .If we had ELLs, we would also evaluate the success of our  program for ELLs based on meeting AYP for our ELLs. The AMAO as described earlier is a very useful tool to measure the  progress towards English profiency      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    If we had ELL students we (Teachers, and guidance counselor) would meet biweekly  to discuss strategies, inclusive of small  group discussions or partnered activities for students. We would also discuss how teachers would provide direct vocabulary  instruction and possibly sentence stems/starters. These interventions would have to be known to all teachers of ELLS so that  there would be consistency across curriculum.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   We have no students who require ELL services and there is no data to review.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   If we had ELL students these findings would be discussed with faculty at our faculty meetings inclusive of our guidance  counselor and ELL Teacher.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   a. Self contained   b. The model is heterogeneous as the students have mixed proficiency levels and are given classes based on the  amount of instructional time that is mandated.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     NA   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      NA      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              If we had ELL students, we would have one teacher work in a self contained model with students. Beginning students  would work with the teacher for three periods (over 120 minutes) a day. Intermediate students would work with the teacher  for two periods (over 80 minutes) a day, and advance students would work with the teacher for one period a day (over 40  minutes). The groups would be heterogeneous with the teacher differentiating instruction as needed.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47         3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      The instruction is delivered in English. Differentiation is an integral part of the ELL teacher's approach and given our small  size, and the fact that the staff meets daily, the teacher is able to get work and support from the students' subject teachers.  The goal for the entire school including the ELL program is to ensure the Common Core Learning Standards are applied in class.  Students are working on more non-fiction texts, and doing more writing which is differentiated. We use methods or  specialized strategies to ensure that when we have ELLs, they will meet the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards.  Specialized strategies include a focus on teaching academic vocabulary, Close reading, text-dependent questions, and use of  writing from sources.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      The Assistant Principal is responsible to getting the material and staff responsible for evaluating      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a) Instructional plan for SIFE students are similar to what we do for ELL students. They would get 360 minutes of ELL  instruction per week as they are usually beginner students. The work would be differentiated for these students with a great  deal of scaffolding and assessment   b) We first assess their skill levels using the TABE exam and their academic records. We then interview the student and family.  Based on that and the home language survey form, we devise an intervention plan which includes placing students in ELL  classes.   c) Look at above   d) Look at above   e) These students are almost always given additional English classes to provide continued instruction. In addition , students  who are eligible for test accommodations are given them.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   All instruction is geared to the Common Core. Within ELL classes, there is a library and texts that are grade specific, and age  appropriate. The goal is to get students to use these. Instruction and strategies are differentiated and scaffolds based on skill  levels of students. Specialized strategies include a focus on teaching academic vocabulary, Close reading, text-dependent  questions, and use of writing from sources      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  As a school we believe in placing students who have IEPs and who are ELLs in the Least Restrictive Environment. We would  identify students strengths and then program to student strength. Where students require additional support, we provide  SETTSS as well as tutoring to ensure that our ELLs meet the requirements for graduation.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.   All students in our transfer school including ELL students are eligible for and given AIS services which are specific interventions  for any of the subject area. AIS is provided for 43 minutes a period four days a week in all subject areas. In addition, tutoring is   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      offered after school and on Saturday. The instruction is given in English. We identify specific students by looking at their TABE  scores, exam history, grades in classes, and results of regents exams.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      NA       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   NA. We do not have a bilingual program     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All students at Brooklyn Academy High School are afforded equal access to all programs including after school.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  In addition to classroom instruction, the use of technology is emphasized. Each classroom has a smart board and we have  two  computer labs and student laptops.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   There are text books for all major subjects available in Spanish and Creole which are the primary languages for our students. If  we need texts in another language, we will and have contacted neighboring schools to borrow them or purchase them.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All of the required services are geared to high school at Brooklyn Academy. The materials and resources are age and grade  appropriate. There is an active attempt to differentiate and scaffold the material based on the student's needs.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    In addition to classroom instruction, the use of technology is emphasized. Each classroom has a smartboard and we have two  brand new computer labs.      16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Each student goes through a new student orientation which helps them to become more familiar with the school. They are  also assigned a career adviser and meet individually with the Guidance Counselor. Students also are placed in advisory teams  with individual teachers. This allows for more support of students both for academic and social emotional. All students must  enroll with CAMBA, our CBO. They can become a part of our LTW program through CAMBA, also be supported by their  advocate with the college and career path of their choosing.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Spanish  American Sign Language      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49   NA           Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  NA. We do not have any ELL teachers, if we did professional development would originate from Brooklyn North Field Support  Office.     NA. We do not have any ELL teachers, if we did we would follow the professional development from our Field Support Office.      2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Supports would be generated from Brooklyn North Field Support Center    Professional Development would come from Brooklyn North Field Support Center.            Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Each parent is required to attend a mandated parent orientation that helps to identify the individual needs of both students  and parents. Native language translators are provided as needed. If needed translations will be provided at parent meetings  and at our School Leadership  meetings.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  Paste response to question here:  Currently we do not have ELL students. If we did as with all parents in our school they would  have the opportunity to attend all school activities. Translations would be provided by two of our teachers, both in Spanish and  Haitian Creole.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:                                                                                   School DBN:     Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
