This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The Eagle Academies for Young Men develop young men that are committed to the pursuit of academic excellence,  strong character, and responsible leadership.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   Eagle is an all boys middle school and high school in the heart of Brownsville, Brooklyn. Our young men take an active  role in ensuring their own success and providing evidence of their academic and social proficiency. They do this by  exhibiting the 5 Pillars of Eagle Scholarship: Effort, Confidence, Resilience, Leadership, and Commitment to Excellence.  Our scholars are placed into one of the six Eagle Houses named after prominent men of color. They are with their  house brothers throughout their academic career at Eagle. Scholars start and end their day with their house brothers  and house leaders.    We currently have 646 scholars in our building. We partner with AP for All, College Access for All, Empire and Eagle  Foundation. Our current attendance rate is 87%. Eagle is an all- boys school. We have at least 65% scholars receiving  free lunch. We currently have 25.5% SWD and 0.6% ELL.    Our strengths include building positive culture around our scholars and educators. We have multiple partnerships  with outside organizations so that our scholars can gain life skills as well as academics.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   We also have a percentage of scholars in temporary housing. For those scholars, we are required to provide extended  guidance through our counselors. We also are sure to set aside funds to purchase supplies and uniform supplies. Our  current attendance rate is 87%. Eagle is an all- boys school. We have at least 65% scholars receiving free lunch. We  currently have 25.5% SWD and 0.6% ELL. Our support ranges from ICT classes, SETSS services and pull outs.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   We have made the most growth during the past year in the alignment of our curriculum, assessments and using data  to inform our decisions. This is the Rigorous Instruction element. We have also begun to train more of our educators  to use Excel in order to create spreadsheets and to analyze data in order to determine topics for re-teaching. These  are also our key areas of focus for the coming year as we still have much growth to continue.                   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 23K644   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08,09,10,11,1 2   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   647   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

During observations in 2016-2017, 18% of our educators were rated as developing in 2a and 2c classroom  management, which led to decreased time on task and poor student achievement. During observation in 2017-2018,  17% of our educators are still struggling.   Upon examining our practice, we realized that the daily work our scholars were being given was not nearly as rigorous  across the school as necessary to prepare our young men for the quality and quantity of work they will have to do in  college. We also realized, utilizing part of the Danielson framework, components 1e (Designing Coherent Instruction),  3b (Using Questioning and Discussion Techniques), 3c (Engaging Scholars in Learning) and 3d (Using Assessment in  Instruction our educators will improve their practice and ensure scholars are exposed to more rigorous work.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  Scheduling and Common Planning Opportunities At Eagle Ocean Hill, we believe teacher quality is at the heart of  student achievement. As such we designed a schedule that meets the individual needs of both students and teachers  in multiple ways. First, all content area courses take place before lunch and thus educators have the ability to work  collaboratively to design lessons, discuss scholar performance, and share best practices and assessments.  Furthermore, due to the unique scheduling, department common planning time and grade team meetings have been  put in place to ensure student progress and assessments are being collected and analyzed by the team. This is  especially important for ELA educators, as they are primarily responsible for introducing and aiding the scholars in  becoming proficient in reading skills. ELA educators utilize this time to work collaboratively in order to desegregate  data gathered from assessments. Such information allows educators to further understand what students have  learned and what skills they still need to master. Moreover this time has been spent recommending different  strategies that may aid in scholars reading development. Tips on fluency, comprehension, proper speed for read- alouds, even how to help scholars chose an independent book are discussed.   Lesson Study: This practice is the linchpin of our teaming processes to support academic excellence. Lesson study was  developed in Japan, and is a professional development program that centers on collaborative study of live classroom  lessons. ELA educators work together to develop rich lessons. The goal is to discover and discuss best teaching  practices that may aid in the scholars achieving a reading growth of 1.25 years. With the understanding that  demanding schedules will make it difficult for ELA educators to constantly be in each other’s rooms, the use of video  cameras has been implemented. As such, ELA educators have the ability to watch the lesson at their leisure as well as  pause and rewind as different strategies are discovered. In addition to directly impacting student learning, this  practice gives teachers an opportunity to engage in reflective practice, while building teacher professionalism.        2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   At Eagle Ocean Hill we schedule one day per month as Department or whole staff instructional PD. During this time,  educators are exposed to and work with developing strategies for engagement and using data to determine how to  best support all scholars. Educators plan collaboratively and look at data as it is aligned to common core standards.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          32      Content educators in Social Studies and Science are immersed in a series of professional development on how to  infuse the literacy standards into their daily instruction.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33      Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34        Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Eagle Academy for Young Men II, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I,  Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.       Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Eagle Academy for Young Men II will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  We use the Stars Reading Program and F & P to assess the early literacy skills of our ELL students.  Our BOY Stars and F&P  results administered in Sept/Oct reveal that 3/5 of our ELL students are reading at below grade level.  While one is a non-  reader and struggles to identify sight words, decode and comprehend. We have used this data to determine what intervention  programs will be utilized to improve the reading levels.  Wilson will be utilized with students who have been identified as  having decoding/encoding deficiences and the Stars Reading Program and Castle Learning will be utilized with the students  who need to improve their comprehension skills in order to master targeted CCLS standards.          2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?   We constantly monitor the progress of our ELL students through rigorous assessment in all subject areas. During our teacher  team meetings, teachers have the time to go over data and plan instruction collaborative to ensure the academic success of  our ELL students Teacher observation notes are reviewed as well as formal and informal class assessments. All content area  teachers give a brief report about the ELL students' strenghts and weaknesses in that particular class. The goal is to work  collaborative to support their learning.        4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?         5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Two of our ELL students remained at the Advanced and Intermediate levels respectively. One did poorly and moved from  Intermediate to Beginning level.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?               Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   The ENL teacher offers a pull out service. Our ELLs at the present time have IEPs, the ENL teacher pays attention to  their individual academic needs.  Our program is designed to make it easier to provide the mandated service hours to  all eligible students, and to  ensure that our students get the maximum support available to them. They follow  the  program set for their assigned classes, with weekly instructional periods that meet all NY City and State  regulations in ELA, math, science, social studies, foreign language, PE, and the arts.  Major subject area teaching  periods range from five to ten periods per week. The ENL mandates are integrated into their core curriculum.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A     c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?                                 Instruction is provided entirely in English. A part-time ENL specialist provides pullout services three days per  week, according to the       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45             number of minutes mandated by students' proficiency levels as indicated by their most recent NYSESLAT scores.  In  addition, to the              50 minute of academic intervention from an assigned teacher, our ELL student receives pull-out instructional time, and  occasional           push-in instructional time.  Students are pulled out for either individual and/or small group instruction, in order to meet  the           mandated minutes of ENL instruction for their proficiency level as determined on their most recent NYSESLAT.           3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.                   Instruction is focused on language development in reading, writing and oral comprehension; general study skills,  vocabulary for appropriate social interactions and classroom presentations, and content review for test preparation.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      Spanish is the language being offered at Eagle Academy II.  Some of our ELLs do 2 sessions weekly of this language which is  their native language.  They are taught the rudiments of the language, how to speak, listen, write, and read in  Spanish.  Periodic assessments are done by the foreign language teacher.         5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status     All teachers in middle school employ several strategies to provide access to content material and to accelerate English  Language development.  Many of our students read below grade level, and are challenged by the volume and level of required  reading and writing in their subject area classes.  All subject area teachers emphasize reading and writing skills, including in  math, science, and physical education classes.  Remedial reading programs, such as Wilson, are also used by some teachers to  help students master reading.          6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   ENL and classroom teachers utilize curriculum supports and strategies included in our core programs in order to differentiate  instruction to our ELLs.  Additonal programs have also been purchased to supplement our core curriculum in an advanced  effort to meet their needs.  Supplemental programs such as STARS, Wilson Reading and Castle Learning aid in differentiating  instruction to our ELLs.  Addtionally, learning and interest inventories are administered to these students and are incorporated  into planning lessons that meet the needs of these learners.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?   ENL and classroom teachers utilize curriculum supports and strategies included in our core programs in order to  differentiate  instruction to our ELLs.  Additonal programs have also been purchased to supplement our core curriculum in an  advanced effort to meet their needs.  Supplemental programs such a Castle Learning, Wilson Reading and Achieve 3000 aid in  differentiating instruction to our ELLs.  Addtionally, learning and interest inventories are administered to these students and  are incorporated into planning lessons that meet the needs of these learners.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.   Our school uses data from standardized assessments (NYS, NYC Performance Assessments and school-wide benchmarks) to  help determine appropriate intervention programs for all students.  The results consistently indicate to us the needed  interventions with strong focus on the development of reading and writing skills across the curriculum.  We recognize this as a  school-wide need.  Some Eagle Academy students read below grade level.  Our curriculum preparation includes response to  intervention, focusing on specific reading strategies for students and basic decoding strategies.  We have instituted small  group sessions during the school day for all students who scored level 1 and 2 on the NYS ELA test last year.  Our ELLs are all in  that category.  Strategies that work well for our struggling native English Language readers are also helpful for emergent  readers.  We are committed to providing academically rigorous instruction for our ELL students, utilizing various scaffolding techniques  and instructional methodologies to differentiate instruction in the content area classes, such as graphic organizers, building on  prior knowledge, lab inquiry in science, audiovisual materials, environmental learning (field trips), manipulatives in math  classes, computer technology in all subject area classes, differentiated reading materials, collaborative assignments, modeling,  bridging, contextulization, schema building, connecting text to self and community and meta-cognition.  Our assigned educator  meets regularly with ELLs' content area teachers to find out the the performance of these students on benchmark assessments  that were given in class. All instruction is in English.          9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?        This year we have a focus on integrating technology into our curriculum to heighten student engagement and allow ELLs  mulitple entry points.  The use of interactive Smartboards, laptops, smart repsonse systems, document cameras and software  programs will allow classroom teachers and the ENL teachers to provide rigorous, engaging and targeted instruction to  improve student performance.  Also the professional development that our teachers will receive should aid in improving  practices designed to meet the needs of these students.  The new common core curriculum will be introduced into the  program.  The content given in CodeX will used to complement the program.  Our focus is student engagement. Therefore, our  ELLs will be fully engaged in the acquisition of English Language.  We are striving to improve our existing program by providing  our Ells with more opportunities to use assistive technology to strengthen their English Language Development     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   There will be no discontinuance of programs/services.  The Ell population is small in our school - never comprising more than  three percent of the student body.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Our ELL students are afforded equal access to any and all programs offered at our school.  These programs include all extra  curricula activities, such as After School Academic Program and Saturday Academy. Permission slips are distributed to all of our  students at the same time.  When needed, permission slips for all programs are translated into the native language that the  parents speak and they are asked to send them back whether permission is granted or not.  When ELLs participate in any  program, the teachers and club facilitators are made aware of who the ELL students are and are encouraged to employ  strategies learned at various workshops to allow ELLs full access to the programs.  Teachers/facilitors are encouraged to seek  the assistance of administrators if they have difficulty meeting the needs of these students.          12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  This year we have a focus on integrating technology into our curriculum to heighten student engagement and allow ELLs  mulitple entry points.  The use of interactive Smartboards, laptops, smart repsonse systems, document cameras and software  programs will allow classroom teachers and the ESL teachers to provide rigorous, engaging and targeted instruction to improve  student performance.            13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47         Because we have such and no newly arrived immigrant students, we do not offer  programs specific to newly enrolled ELLs  before the start of the school year.  If our demographics change in the future, we will consider implementing such programs.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.   Eagle Academy is a middle school/ highschool.  All our programs, resources and supports are specific to this age group.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    This year we have a focus on integrating technology into our curriculum to heighten student engagement and allow ELLs  mulitple entry points.  The use of interactive Smartboards, laptops, smart repsonse systems, document cameras and software  programs will allow classroom teachers and the ESL teachers to provide rigorous, engaging and targeted instruction to improve  student performance.            16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).    Since we have so few Ells and no newly arrived immigrant student, we do not offer program specific to newly enrolled Ells  before the start of the school year.  If our demographics change in the future, we will consider implementing such  programs.  However, we do offer an orientation session for all students and parents at the end of summer.  Our assigned  educator, or a volunteer parent is usually there to translate and explain policies and procedures in the student/parent's native  language.          17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Spanish is the only foreign language being offered.      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  N/A     The certified part-time ENL specialist we share with Mott Hall IV participates in district, regional, cluster, network, and city- wide professional development for ENL teachers.  He consults with classroom teachers on how to meet the needs of ELLs in  the content area, offering ideas for differentiation and language development support.  Teachers of self-containted special  education classes, which serve two of our ELLs, also participate in school-wide, district, and network PD for ELLs. Additionally,  the NSL specialist will offer PD's to classroom teachers of our ELL student.      2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48          When we have ELLs in the eighth grade, they receive support from our guidance counselor to help navigate the high school  admission process, and to prepare for the transition to high school.  If we have 8        th       grade ELL's our ENL specialist works  with  them making sure that they and their families understand how to use the high school directory,  how to select high  school choices, and how to correctly fill out their high school applications.  The Parent Coordinator hosts a workshop  specifically for ELLs' parents, and ENL teacher reviews the eighth grade ELLs' high school applications with them, before they  are returned to the guidance counselor. Classroom teachers, our parent coordinator, community workers, and the office staff  who work with our incoming 6th grade and 9        th       grade, are supported by our school administration in helping these  students learn school routines and discipline.  When a language other than English is indicated on the Home Language survey,  and when parents have requested translated school communications, letters  sent home by teachers are translated, either  using DOE translation services, or by a staff member fluent in the language     Professional development sessions are held weekly for all teaching staff, as well as on designated city-wide PD days, that  include instructional differentation for ELL students.  All school staff, including pedagogues, administrators, secretaries,  guidance, community workers and parent coordinator are invited to participate in ENL professional development.  Copies of all  PD agendas and attendance are kept in the Principal's office.            Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Annually, parents of ELLs are invited to meet with the LPT.   At this meeting a teacher who is proficient in the parent's  preferred language is present to translate the information.  The student's academic and language development progress,  English language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas are discussed. School  staff necessary to sufficiently inform the parents or guardians about the child’s language development in all content areas in  English will be present.  A qualified interpreter/translator in the language or mode of communication the parent or guardian  best understands will be there. Attendance is recorded and kept with student's permanent records.     2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Parents are surveyed at the beginning of each year, during intake and at the initial PTA meetings, as to their interests and  needs, to encourage them to participate, and to discuss ways they can be involved with their child's class and with the school  community.  ELL parents are invited to participate in our active PTA, which provides workshops for parents throughout the year.  Recent  topics have included: test preparation and accommodations; NY State learning standards; Common Core learning standards;  graduation information; high school admissions information; summer learning opportunities; and parenting issues.  Our administrators and parent coordinator communicate with parents regularly via Monthly newsletters to foster awareness  of issues pertaining to students' academic and social development, and to share information about community events. When  parents have requested translated communications, translation services are provided, usually by a staff member fluent in the  language, or via DOE translation services.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Rashad Meade, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Eagle Academy for Young Men II                                                                              School DBN: 23K  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
