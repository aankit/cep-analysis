This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The PS 153 school community is a family where all members, students, staff and parents work together toward the  common goal of creating a learning environment where all children can achieve at their highest potential. All  members of this community strive to be lifelong learners and be responsible and accountable individuals who value  education. All stakeholders endeavor to be active participants in achieving the goals we set for our school.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      Maspeth Elementary School is committed to providing each students an exemplary educational experience promoting  high expectations, inspiring a sense of social responsibility while supporting each student's physical, social and  emotional needs. The P.S. 153 Family of Students, Teachers, and Parents, embrace our mission statement :       Maspeth Elementary School is committed to providing each student an exemplary educational experience promoting  high expectations, inspiring a sense of social responsibility while supporting each student’s physical, social and  emotional needs.    Vision   A public community school, cultivating exceptional socially responsible thinkers, prepared for the future       Slogan   Building a Solid Foundation for a Brighter Tomorrow   Core Values:      Learning      Learning is an active, joyful process of discovery where students are challenged to ask essential questions, solve  problems in disciplined and creative ways, and construct substantive understandings under the guidance of  passionate and inspiring teachers. We are committed to reflection, evaluation, evolution and innovation as means to  improve teaching and learning. Learning extends beyond the classroom to instill in students a sense of mission and  purpose as citizens of the larger community and world.      Respect      We have a high regard for oneself and others. This includes self-worth, pride, physical well-being, contentment,  peace, humor, appreciation for differences and individuality, fairness, and tolerance.      Academic Potential      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      We believe all individuals are capable of learning and are entitled to opportunities needed to fulfill their individual  potential and become lifelong learners. All students will be provided with a variety of instructional approaches to  support their learning and demonstrate their achievement.       Collaboration       We value working together as an authentic and inclusive community to imagine, to create and to solve problems, and  to support each other in all that we do.      Perseverance       We recognize that our relentless quest towards excellence is full of obstacles and conflict. We turn stumbling blocks  into stepping stones and demonstrate perseverance by identifying challenges and striving to overcome them.       Creativity and Expression      We believe that creative expression is a basic human need. We are dedicated to connecting children with their ability  to create and to express themselves.          2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Opening its doors to the Maspeth community in 1930, PS 153 is an elementary school with approximately 1208  students from Pre-kindergarten through Grade 6. The community is home to many new immigrants mainly from  Poland, Ecuador, Dominican Republic and Egypt. The student body includes 10.67% English Language Learners and  18% Students with Disabilities. The school population comprises 1% Black, 44% Hispanic, 45% White, and 10% Asian  students. Approximately 72% of our students are economically disadvantaged. Additionally, 12.3% of our students are  Gifted and Talented students enrolled in our Beacon Program from across District 24. The average attendance rate for  the school year 2017-2018 was 94.39%.       Using available data (New York State ELA and Math Scores, New York State English as a Second Language Assessment  Test (NYSESLAT), ADVANCE, Measures of Student Learning (MOSL), our Instructional Leadership Team developed an  Instructional Focus for our school. Recognizing that high quality teaching is the most powerful tool for helping  students reach higher standards, we focused our efforts and resources toward creating a rigorous and coherent  instructional experience for both students and teaching staff. The following levers are being implemented to  strengthen teaching practices to improve outcomes for all students across all grades and content areas:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      Currently we are working with Northeast Foundation for Children to implement the Responsive Classroom approach to  social/emotional development. This is a research and evidence based program designed to foster safe, challenging  and joyful classrooms.   In addition, we are working with Reading Reform Foundation to train our ENL and SWD ICT teachers in grades K-2  using Spalding's Writing Road to Reading language arts program. By the end of the 2017-2018 school year our ENL  and SWD ICT teachers will be trained and implementing the program in grades K - 2.   We will also be working with Teachers College, implementing the TC Writing program in grades K-5.   Through a grant provided by the City Council, P.S. 153 partners with Queens Theatre in the Park for their Cultural  After-School Adventures (CASA) program called CentreStage. For this theater program, a teaching artist comes to our  school and works with 25 third and fourth graders twice weekly, for a ten week period. Students who participate in  CentreStage are guided through a process of story creation, character development, and script writing. The  culminating activity is an evening performance at Queens Theatre in the Park.   Greater Ridgewood Youth Council, a community based organization, conducts an after school homework and  recreation program for over 150 of our students in grades 2-6. Students participate in a host of extra-curricular  activities such as, athletic activities, drama, cheer leading, art, homework help, etc. The program runs until 6:00PM  thus providing needed child care for our parents.     Our schools Instructional Focus, to use data systems to identify student needs and strengths, thereby shifting  instruction to ensure the needs of all learners are being met, with emphasis on small group instruction based on  summative and formative assessments, provides the focus for our CEP goals, PLC work and professional development.     3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Our Students with Disabilities and our ENL student population in grades K-2 have made negligible progress in their  reading levels. Accordingly we moved away from Fundations and now are implementing the Spalding Writing Road to  Reading program. In addition, we will be implementing Teacher's College Writing in grades K-5 for the 2018-2019  school year.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   P.S. 153 has used the Framework for Great Schools to guide our efforts to support student achievement. Two  elements in which we made progress over the past year are rigorous instruction and supportive environment.      During the 2017-2018 school year, we spent additional time on our 2016-2017 rigorous instruction goal of deepening  teachers practice so that the delivery of instruction meets the needs of all learners. Data from Advance shows that we  met this goal with 89.85% (90%) of our teacher observations being rated effective or highly effective.      To meet this goal administrators provided supports, resources and feedback that teachers used to engage all students  in learning. They also afforded teachers the opportunity to attend in-house and off-site professional development  related to the instructional focus. Teachers were also given the chance to turnkey the information from professional  development sessions so they could share their learning with colleagues.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12      During the 2017-2018 school year, we worked diligently toward our supportive environment goal of establishing a  school and classroom culture where everyone feels safe, supported, stimulated and challenged to function at their  optimal capacity. All K-2 classes implemented the Responsive Classroom rituals and routines. All teachers of grades 3- 6 and out of classroom teachers received a full day of Responsive Classroom training in June 2018. Because we believe  that social, emotional abilities are indicators of how well a person adjusts to his or her environment, adapts to change  and, ultimately, how successful she or he will be in life.we created a Social Emotional Learning (SEL) Cadre. This cadre  lead a Professional Learning Cycle (PLC) on the benefits of social and emotional learning and teachers explored  strategies for implementing SEL in the classroom.      A key area of focus for the 2018-2019 school year is strong family and community ties. Recognizing the importance of  partnering with parents, P.S 153 would like to expand the level of parental involvement in our school community. We  have chosen to make this one of our CEP goals and have designed an action plan that is intended to increase the  scope of our communication with parents. We will work to gather electronic data from parents so that less  communication will be back-packed and digital communication will increase by connecting with parents via text  messaging, emails, and voice messages.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 24Q153   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05,06   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   1204   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     The Instructional Cabinet reviewed the protocols for collecting and analyzing student data in literacy and math. We  have numerous systems in place for the collection of student date, and include scheduled data dives across the  academic year. While teachers are able to work together to identify student needs and strengths grade-wide, there is  a gap between what is identified and how teachers can best address these areas in their instruction. For this reason  we have shifted our instructional focus for the 2018-2019 school year: "To use data systems to identify student needs  and strengths, thereby shifting instruction to ensure the needs of all learners are being met, with emphasis on small  group instruction based on summative and formative assessments."        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   By June 2019, 100% of classroom teachers will have goals that demonstrate evidence of alignment with the instructional  focus, specifically the use of data systems to identify student needs and strengths thereby shifting instruction to ensure  the needs of all learners are being met, with a focus on small group instruction based on summative and formative  assessments.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

Teachers administered the Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Reading assessments throughout the 2017-2018 school  year. After a review of instructional reading levels it was evident that less than half of our K-2 students (44.9%) were  reading on or above grade level. It is our goal to increase this percentage for the 2018-2019 school year by altering  the existing literacy schedule to program morning literacy blocks that will include more frequent guided reading,  intensive word work, and additional independent reading time.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Column B   Verify with an (X)   Section Reference(s)   Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local                                                  1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35       Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS 153Q , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      PS 153Q will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the ESSA;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;             The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Pact;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format, and to the  extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

These programs will include an early morning program, after-school program, and a Saturday  Family program. Student attendance will be taken at each session by the certified ENL teacher  and collected by the supervisor each week.  Students are invited to each program through a  school letter in parents' preferred language that the ENL supervisor collects to organize classes.    *Early Morning Program:  P.S. 153's Title III program provides English Language Learners with supplemental instruction  in a Newcomer Morning Program before school. This program will target entering ELL's initial  literacy instruction. This instructional program will service entering ELLs in grades 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,  and 6 who are determined to be at the entering or emerging levels based on the 2017- 2018 NYSITELL results or the 2018 NYSESLAT scores. In the 2017-2018 school year, 2 first  graders, 4 third graders, 4 fourth graders, 3 fifth graders, and 1 sixth grader scored as new  comers on the NYSITELL.  In 2018, 1 Kindergarten,  1 first grader,  1 second grader, and 2  fourth graders scored entering or emerging on the NYSESLAT. These NYSITELL or  NYSESLAT results reveal that these students need foundational English literacy skills.  In total,  there are 19 students scoring as newcomers on the NYSITELL and the NYSESLAT combined.  Also, students who enter as newcomers throughout the school year are invited to the morning  program upon registration. Group size will be maintained at 10 students per teacher. There will  be 3 classes: one for students grades 1-2, 3-4, and 5-6. This program will run 3 times a week for  16 weeks for a total of 42 sessions. The program will run from 7:30 a.m. to 8:15 a.m. from  October 30, 2018-February 14, 2019. Three licensed, certified ENL teachers will provide  supplemental instructional support in alignment with Common Core Learning Standards.  Teaching will focus on sequential literacy instruction targeting  letter identification, letter  naming, letter sounds, phoneme segmentation, cvc words, blends, digraphs, non sense words,  and reading fluency. Supplemental materials will be provided to augment English Language  Acquisition. Wilson Fundations program is a research based program that provides students with  thorough practice in literacy skills with a focus on fluency. Instruction will encompass reading,  writing, listening, and speaking as students use literacy skills to facilitate language acquisition  and vocabulary development.  This program is designed to meet the priority needs identified  during the evaluation of our incoming ELLs. Parents will receive an invitation letter in English  and in home languages describing the program. General instructional supplies, such as chart  paper, markers, paper, and home language materials will be purchased with Title III monies to  support this morning program.      *After-School Program:  ELLs for the after-school program will be chosen based on 2018 NYSELSAT proficiency levels  (Emerging, Transitioning and Expanding) in grades 3-6.  The 2018 data reveals that there are 27  Expanding (EX) students (third grade = 8 students; fourth grade = 6 students; fifth grade = 8   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   students; Sixth grade = 5 students).  There are 11  students at the Transitioning (TR) level (third  grade = 0 students; fourth grade = 4 students; fifth grade = 4 students; sixth grade = 3  students).  There are 2 students on the Emerging level (third grade = 1; fifth grade = 1). This  program aims to increase English proficiency  by supporting academic language acquisition.  Two groups will be maintained at no more than 20 students each for grades 3-4 and 5-6. This  program will consist of 20 sessions to begin in January 2018 and end in March 2019.   The after  school program will take place twice a week on Wednesdays  and Thursdays from 2:45-4:00 ( 75  minutes). Two certified ENL teachers will partner with a teaching artist from Arts Connection to  provide ELLs with direct instruction in literacy through drama. The focus will be on using the  arts as a vehicle for increasing language proficiency to expand and enrich language learning  experiences, increase language skills (speaking, listening, reading and writing), and master new  vocabulary.    Saturday Family Academy  PS 153's Title III program provides English Language Learners with supplemental instruction in  a Saturday Family Academy program.  The focus of this program is to incorporate reading,  writing, listening and speaking to increase proficiency to the Commanding level and to support  already Commanding students by supporting academic language acquisition.  The Saturday  Family Academy classes will meet a total of 8 sessions beginning April 2019 through May 2019,  from 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m.  The Saturday Family Academy will also service the  parents/guardians by providing them with ENL instruction. One supervisor will be provided as  there are no other programs running at this time. Group class sizes will be maintained at 15  students per teacher.  There will be three classes for the Saturday Family Academy, servicing  approximately 45 English Language Learners (K-1, 2-3 and 4-5) at the entering, emerging,  transitioning, expanding and commanding levels on the NYSESLAT/NYSITELL. The  2018 NYSESLAT data reveals that there are 36 commanding students, 45 expanding, 16  transitioning, 6 emerging and 5 entering students in grades 1-6. The most current  NYSITELL data reveals that 11 students are entering, 5 students are emerging, 5 students are  transitioning and 5 students are expanding in grades K-6. A fourth class will provide ENL  instruction for the parents/guardians of the ELLs by a licensed ENL teacher. Three licensed and  certified ENL teachers will provide supplemental instructional support aligned to the Learning  Standards for the students. Part of the day will focus on literacy through the Language Power:  Building Language Proficiency Program. Teachers will provide direct instruction through the use  of thematic texts that are based on Science and Social Studies themes.  Through reading, writing,  listening and speaking, students will have multiple exposures to vocabulary and language  structures, opportunities to use the language in context, and to build background knowledge. The  second part of the day will support academic language acquisition through hands-on activities  with Lego Education.  Upper grade students will use the intermediate Lego sets to construct  simple machines with a partner while building reading, writing, listening and speaking skills at  the same time.  Students will become familiar with new vocabulary such as, "wheel and axle",  "pulley", "lever", etc. Lower grade students will engage in activities with Lego StoryStarter kits  that allow them to conceptualize and think through a story.                        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47            Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information                         Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.     rationale  teachers to receive training          schedule and duration      name of provider   topics to be covered   Begin description here:             Based on the 2017-2018 ELA standardized assessment there were 18 ELL students (17%) who  scored a level 1. Additionally, 19 ELL students (18%) scored a level 1 on the Mathematics state  assessment.  In reflection of this data, we will provide our teachers who service ELL's with  professional development to support the needs of these students.  P.S. 153 will partner with the  Center for Integrated Teacher Education to provide professional development from a CITE  Educational Consultant who will focus on how to prepare ELLs to meet and exceed standards in  literacy in a full day Saturday session (date to be determined). Topics to be addressed will be  effective instructional strategies that focus on the essential components of reading instruction,  best classroom practices, the SIOP Model, and creating language objectives. As teachers  implement strategies learned, we hope to see growth in student performance in ELA and Math.  At least ten percent of the total allocation of title III funds has been set aside for professional  development. Attendance sheets and agendas are kept in a binder with ENL related documents.

Classes will be held from  8:00am- 11:00am, from April 2019 through May 2019.  ELL parents/guardians will also have opportunities to attend a variety of family literacy and  math workshops, so that they can better assist in the education and learning of their children at  home. A series of three, one-hour workshops will be held on different topics (times to be  announced) to accommodate different schedules.  Three workshops will address the following:  Parents will be coached in how to understand the learning standards in Math.  Parents will  become familiar with the ENL learning standards and NYSESLAT assessment.  Parents will  become familiar with the learning standards for Literacy (Reading, Writing,  Language).  An  ENL teacher, the Parent Coordinator, and the math and literacy coaches will  facilitate parent workshops. Interpretation services will be provided at each session.  Parents will  be notified of these opportunities through invitations that will be provided in their home  language. At least ten percent of the total allocation of Title III funds has been set aside for  parental involvement.      Families of ELLs will be invited to a Multicultural Family Night, in which P.S. 153 celebrates  cultural diversity. Parents participate by providing food for the event. Students participate by  performing cultural dances, singing songs, playing musical instruments, and creating cultural  artwork. Certified ENL teachers participate by planning fun stations with various cultural  activities for families to engage in during the event. Flyers for the event will be translated into  parents' home language. Multicultural Family Night will take place mid-year (date to be  determined).

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?        3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52         Literacy skills are assessed through the Fountas & Pinnell Benchmark Assessment Systems in grades K-6, three times per year  and performance tasks in writing and mathematics.  Data from the previous benchmarks (Teacher's College running records)  for reading show that ELLs continue to need strong instructional support in the modality of reading.  Data from the NYSESLAT  indicates that strong instructional support is needed in the modalities of reading and writing.All English language learners are  provided with differentiated instruction that will cover all content areas, including literacy, mathematics, science and social  studies to meet and exceed the CCLS. ELLs participate in the literacy curriculum, where the teacher engages ELLs in read  alouds,  the Socratic Seminar, language experience, shared reading, close reading of grade level texts, one-to-one conferring,  guided reading and independent reading.  Ells are also engaged in writing instruction through modeled writing, shared writing,  guided writing, independent writing, and interactive writing.  In the early grades, the Wilson Fundations Phonics program lays  the groundwork for life-long literacy through a systematic approach in critical foundational skills.  The Spalding Method  (Scientifically-based Language Arts Instruction) provides phonemic awareness, systematic phonics and vocabulary instruction  to Kindergarten, first grade and second grade  ELLs.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   ELL teachers work collaboratively with their grade level colleagues in planning instruction and developing curriculum maps  that include scaffolds for ELLs. ELL teachers in grades K, 1 and 2 are participating in year long training and support for the  Spalding Method. At monthly meetings for ELL teachers, data is reviewed.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Growth in the four modalities of language learning, namely Listening, Speaking, Reading, and Writing, will be measured by  administering the appropriate grade level NYSESLAT.  Performance Tasks, the NYSESLAT, and State ELA assessments are given  to any ELL who is here for more than one year.  The four modalities will be taught using the content area as a vehicle of  language learning. We realize that the success of ELLs is dependent on their knowledge of the academic language of the  content areas, as well as the exams they must take.  Areas of need continue to be in the reading and writing modalities.  Students will continue to be held to the same rigorous standards in literacy and content area instruction, as native speakers of  English.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Two certified teachers provide Academic Intervention Services to students in need, including ELLs.  Morning and After-School programs are also offered to students, based on reading data, including ELLs.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Diagnostic, formative and summative assessments (Fountas & Pinnell Reading Record, Performance-based  assessments, curriculum based assessments) provide detailed learning profiles of our students.  Based on this data,  ELL students receive Tier 1 instruction through the researched based curriculum (Ready-Gen; Code  X,  Spalding Phonics, Fundations Phonics) as well as word work that is differentiated for students' language needs. For  ELL students who need extra attention, Tier II intervention provides differentiation within the grade level content and  language development by the classroom/ENL teacher.  Tier 2 instruction includes small group instruction, targeted for  specific students' needs in addition to the core content (Double-dose Fundations, Guided Reading, Lexia Reading)   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53         .  Based on collected student data, tier 3 is used when ELLs demonstrate a need for more intensive academic support  (LLI, Wilson Intensive, Rewards, Spire Reading).    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     The administration of the NYSITELL in Kindergarten reveals that the majority of students receiving ENL services in  Kindergarten are first time entrants to the public school system. Grades 4 and 5 have the largest population of ELLs in  the Entering category. The 2017 NYSESLAT indicates that there are 16 First Grade ELLs;  one is Entering, one is  Transitioning, and 14 are Expanding students. Of the 10 second grade ELLs, one is Emerging,  3 are transitioning and 6  are Expanding students. There are no Entering students in grade 2. Of the 14 third grade ELLs, one is entering, 3  are Transitioning and 10 are Expanding. There are no Emerging students in grade 3.  Of the 14 fourth grade ELLs,, one  is Emerging, one, 3 are Transitioning and 10 are Expanding students. There are no entering students in grade 4.  Of  the 9 ELLs in grade five, 1 is Entering, 2 are emerging, one is transitional and 5 are Expanding students.  Of the 10 ELL  students in sixth grade, one is emerging, 2 are transitioning and 7 are Expanding.  There are no Entering students in  grade 6.  Across the grades, from K through 6 in General Education classes, beginner ELLs are first time entrants into  the English public school system who have been here less than one year. Based on this data, ELLs are grouped  heterogeneously in grade level classes. K-5 are serviced by a licensed ENL teacher in a self-contained classroom, and  6th grade is serviced through a push-in/pull out model by licensed ENL teacher.   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Data is reviewed by administration and adjustments are made as necessary.   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?       Public School 153Q is a school with a diverse, multicultural population housing grades Pre-Kindergarten-sixth grade. The  school has organized ELLs into selected classes in Kindergarten through sixth grade, in order to facilitate the servicing of ELLs  by a licensed certified ENL teacher. Currently, all ELLs are serviced by an appropriately certified ENL teacher in a  Freestanding English as a New Language program.  ELLs in Kindergarten through fifth grade are serviced by a licensed certified  ENL teacher  in a self-contained grade level classroom among non-ELLs.  ELL students are grouped by mixed proficiency levels  (Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding and Commanding), All ELLs in the free standing ENL program in grade six and the  Special Education self-contained classes in grades K-6, are serviced by certified ENL teachers using a combination of the push- in model and pull out model of instruction .  All ELLs in each program model are grouped heterogeneously, with mixed  proficiency levels.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Paste response to questions here:        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   Paste response to questions here:        5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status             New Arrivals,  Entering and Emerging students receive four 45-minute units of stand alone ENL instruction and four 45- minute units of integrated ENL/ELA instruction for a total of 360 minutes of ENL per week. Transitioning and Expanding  students receive four 45-minute units of Integrated ENL/ELA instruction for a total of 180 minutes per week.  Commanding  ELLs receive a total of 90 minutes per week of Integrated ENL instruction in ELA and Social Studies.  The ENL program has nine   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      appropriately certified ENL teachers who service the ELL population according to the State and City mandates, following the  instructional goals of  the Common Core Learning Standards in Reading, Writing, Language, and Mathematics and the  implementation of the New York City Framework for Great Schools.  ELLs in the ENL program for grade six are grouped into a  designated class to allow for the push-in model of instruction in Literacy to be used effectively. The Push-in ENL teacher adapts  the curriculum by infusing ENL strategies for students of all proficiency levels.  ELLs in grades Kindergarten through fifth grade  are grouped by grade in self-contained ENL classes and receive instruction with ENL strategies throughout the day from a  dually certified teacher.  Home language supports are provided through the use of translanguaging strategies by certified ENL  teachers within the curriculum.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?      The Ready Gen Literacy program, which is aligned to the rigor of the Common Core Learning Standards, uses whole group  instruction, small group instruction, teacher conferences, independent reading and writing, and sharing for  instruction.  Literacy instruction is infused with ENL strategies of Scaffolding, Sheltered English, Verbal and Written Strategies,  Visualization, vocabulary development, Graphic Organizers, Reading to Writing Connections, Translanguaging and  development of Oral language. Differentiated instruction, guided reading and interactive writing are used to meet the needs of  individual students to help them reach grade level learning standards. We integrate the 4 modalities of listening, speaking,  reading and writing. Additionally, the content areas are used as vehicles for ENL instruction to prepare the ELLs for state  standardized exams in Science and Mathematics, as well as reading and writing in the content areas. The teaching of Content  Area and Literacy has both language and content goals. Sheltered English is used in presenting densely worded concepts. The  language and content points are explicitly taught and assessed through individual and group within the literacy instruction.  ENL and classroom teachers employ instructional strategies that include the use of visual supports, bilingual materials, use of  cognates, and the use of home language partners for ELL students, allowing students to access the content. All instruction is  data driven.  The School Leadership Team, classroom and ENL teachers use the results of standards based baseline and  benchmark assessments in Literacy and Mathematics, State ELA and Math data from the previous year, and the NYSESLAT, to  plan instruction that meets the demands of grade level learning standards. We believe that instruction and planning must be  data driven.         7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?    Students who speak Spanish at home and score below proficiency on the NYSITELL are administered a Spanish LAB-R to  determine language dominance.  Title III funds provide entering ELLs with the preparation they need to take the content area  State exams in Science and Mathematics which will be administered with English and home language editions simultaneously  or a translated version.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  SIFE are defined as ELLs who, upon enrollment, have had at least two years less schooling than their peers, and function at  least two years below expected grade level in reading and in mathematics. Title III extended day and Saturday programs are  made available for SIFE  to help them catch up with the basic skills they need in Mathematics and in decoding skills needed for  Reading.  Translanguaging and tiered classroom interventions, including RTI for ELLs' academic success would also be  implemented within the freestanding model for SIFE students. SIFE and newcomer students receive a welcome packet in their  home language with directions, activities, basic vocabulary with picture supports and school-based vocabulary with picture  supports.Differentiated instruction is a core tenet of instruction schoolwide for all ELLs across proficiency levels.    Newcomers receive differentiated instruction for acquiring vocabulary, word work and guided reading, and scaffolded  instruction to allow students access to learning standards. ENL classrooms include labeling, word walls with picture supports,  charts, and instructions with picture supports.  Developing ELLs receive differentiated instruction based on need. Small group instruction in word work and guided reading are  used to meet vocabulary, comprehension, and fluency needs based on formal and informal assessments in reading. Ipads are  used in the classroom for language support. Scaffolded instruction allows developing ells access to the grade level content and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      standards.  Long term ELLs also receive support through small group instruction and classroom interventions. Long-term ELLs receive  vocabulary and language instruction in a small group setting, based on their language needs, to allow them access to the  academc content. RTI would be available for long term ELLs.  Former ELLs receive support in vocabulary and language to support grade level curriculum.   Additionally, Title III extended day and Saturday programs are made available for all ELLs (newcomer, developing, long-term,  former, SIFE) to help them further their Academic English as well as content area concepts.            9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Age appropriate and grade-level materials are used in classrooms of ELL-SWDs that are aligned with the Common Core  Learning Standards so that ELL students maintain academic progress while developing English proficiency. ENL teachers  scaffold the ReadyGen Literacy program, giving ELLs/SWDs access to the grade level content and offers them the same  Common Core experience as other students. Academic language is explicitly taught using ENL strategies, home language  support and differentiated instruction. Shared reading, language experience, close reading of grade level texts, guided  reading and writing are strategies used. In addition, various modes of differentiation, such as learning styles (visual, aural,  kinesthetic, tactile), tiered materials, tiered tasks, flexible groupings, and technology are used. ELL-SWDs in the early grades  engage in the Wilson Fundations Phonics program to build language development.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   The needs of ELL-SWDs are met by creating a flexible schedule that allows students with disabilities to participate in ELL classes  with non-disabled peers, within the framework of the required ENL service hours in reading, writing, and the content areas of  Math, Science and Social Studies, depending on their individual abilities.  ELLs in the Integrated Co-Teaching classes work with  the general education teacher, special education teacher and the ENL teacher (push-in and pull-out models) and receive small  group instruction to achieve their goals. An ENL teacher uses the push-in model for ELLs in self-contained Special Education  classes where the grade level curriculum (Ready-Gen) is scaffolded and adapted to address individual needs of these students.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Last year, one former ELL student received tier 3 intervention with the SPIRE Reading intervention program.   Three newcomers, 7 Developing and 2 former-ELLs received LLI (Leveled Literacy Intervention). Two newcomer ELLs received  the Fundations Phonics intervention program.  The Lexia reading computer program is given to all students, including ELLs to  use in school and at home to provide literacy support and practice. Three Developing and one former ELL received additional  computer time on the Lexia program in our computer lab. Students are identified using the Fountas and Pinnell Reading  Records, Performance-based assessments, curriculum based measurements,  and the screening process for these  programs.  ELLs who scored below standard on the State assessments receive intervention in either ELA and Math, depending  on their needs, in an after-school program. Transitioning and Expanding ELLs receive targeted, small group instruction based  on academic need (reading, writing and/or mathematics), which was determined from student assessment data.  In addition,  intervention is provided through the differentiation of instruction by the classroom teacher and the ENL specialist, who use  formal and informal testing data, as well as observations of performance, to develop targeted instructional strategies and  determine methods for dealing with academic issues.  Teachers monitor on an ongoing basis to determine if the students’  learning and achievement increases.  Commanding students need the continued support to maintain academic progress.  All  commanding students who pass the NYSESLAT are offered the same ELL modifications on standardized testing for a period of  two years. They are placed in designated  ELL classrooms where they benefit from the services of a certified ENL teacher who  maintains the skills of English. Additionally, Title III programs are made available to all current and former ELLs to maintain the  English proficiency skills..  .     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      We will continue to focus on ways to support language learning within the Common Core curriculum.  Based on  NYSITELL/NYSESLAT results, it was determined that a morning program to provide newcomer English Language Learners with  supplemental instruction in language, would help students with new language acquisition. This program  targets ELLs' initial  literacy instruction with a  focus on sequential literacy instruction targeting  letter identification, letter naming, letter sounds,  phoneme segmentation, cvc words, blends, digraphs, non sense words, and reading fluency.  This work encompasses reading,  writing, listening, and speaking as students use literacy skills to facilitate language acquisition and vocabulary  development.  The Arts Connection Bridges program uses puppetry to encourage creative play, storytelling, creative writing,  pantomime and improvisation. The Arts Connection Cartooning grant works to increase student arts achievement while  targeting the needs of diverse learners, including English Language Learners.  3rd graders will create an original comic strip, 4th  graders and 5th graders will work on creating a longer story.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs and participate in the same academic standards, cluster programs, Arts  residencies (Arts Connection, After-School Rocks), after-school programs (Arts Connection, Chorus, Flag Football) and school- wide events (STEM Night, Family Fitness Night, etc).  ELLs who are below grade level in literacy and/or math, based on State Assessment scores, participate in an after school  program that prepares ELLs with test-taking strategies and focuses on math concepts and/or reading and language acquisition  in the content areas.  ELLs in all subgroups participate in a Title III Supplemental After School Program with a focus on literacy  and language acquisition.      The  Saturday Inter-generational Academy is available to ELLs in all subgroups and their parents, providing ELA and math  instruction by a licensed ENL teacher and Title III funds. A Title III Morning program is offered for newcomers based on  NYSITELL/NYSESLAT scores, with a focus on language foundations. The Greater Ridgewood Youth Council offers an after school  program at PS 153 which focuses on homework help and extra-curricular activities. All students, including ELLs, are invited to  attend through an application process. Information regarding all programs are made available to parents in home  languages.  The parent coordinator is available for parents.          15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?     ELL teachers use the IPAD to support language and vocabulary with visuals for their newcomer students. Online  programs  such as BrainPop, Starfall., Lexia, and  IXL Learning, are used to support academic content in literacy and math to all  subgroups of ELLs for classroom and home use. Promethean Boards, SMARTBoard Notebook Software and document cameras  are used in the classrooms of ELLs to engage students of all proficiency levels, utilizing tactile, kinestetic and visual  learning.  For ELL-SWD, paraprofessionals are assigned to specific students to provide home language support.  In order to  support the learning of ELLs, grade appropriate libraries in the content areas of Social Studies, Mathematics, and Science have  been purchased in both English and the home languages where possible. Additionally,  reading libraries that are culturally  diverse and bilingual have been purchased to help the ELLs practice reading strategies in their home language. Bilingual  glossaries and dictionaries are provided in all ELL classrooms for students to use daily. All Ready Gen Literacy, Go Math and  Science and Social Studies Core Curriculum materials are used with our ELL students and Spanish versions are used where  available. In addition to Spanish texts, we continually look to purchase home language texts for the titles in the Ready Gen  program in our home languages such as Polish and Arabic. Teachers use TPR, charts, visuals, graphic organizers, sentence  frames and small group instruction to scaffold and support content area learning.  ELLs have home language partners when  needed to support newcomer ELLs.             16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57         Home language support is delivered through classroom libraries in ENL classrooms that are culturally diverse and  have been  purchased to help the ELLs practice the reading strategies in their home language. The skills in the home language will support  their English acquisition. To employ the benefits of bilingualism, teachers implement translanguaging strategies that use the  home language and the new language to support language learning and to keep ELL students engaged.  In order to support the  learning of ELLs, age and grade appropriate libraries in the content areas of Social Studies, Mathematics, and Science have  been purchased in both English and the home Language (Polish, Spanish, Chinese, Arabic, Russian) in the classrooms of  ELLs.  Bilingual glossaries and dictionaries are provided in all ELL classrooms for students to use daily.        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Required ENL services correspond to students’ age at the time of registration when they are placed in the appropriate grade  according to their age.  Resources available to ELLs correspond to age and grade levels.  All classrooms, including those for  ELLs,  utilize age and grade appropriate resources that  support and are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards and  NYC Core Curriculum so that ELLs maintain academic progress while developing English proficiency.  In order for all ELLs to  access the grade level content, academic language is explicitly taught using ENL strategies and differentiated instruction.  Resources, such as graphic organizers, IPads, SMARTBoard, and visuals support ELLs in accessing the content at the grade level  standard.  Scaffolded  instruction and multimedia experiences are also provided so all ELLs can participate in the grade-level work.             18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   We do not share a building.             Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Newly enrolled ell students receive a welcome packet in their home language upon arrival.  An  ENL teachers escorts them to  their new classroom and introduces the classroom teacher. When possible, teachers create partnerships with students in the  class who speak the same language, or a new student is paired with a partner to help them throughout the school day . ENL  teachers use Translanguaging strategies in the classroom to allow students to use their home language when participating in  class. Dictionaries and home language books are provided for newly enrolled ells. All newly enrolled ELLs are offered Title III  programs to jump start their English, and support the content areas, as well as English language development.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.

How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Paste response to question here:      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  The classroom teachers in the all grades are provided Professional Development in teaching ELLs.  PD’s include the techniques  of differentiated learning, Sheltered English, Modified Guided Reading with ENL infused strategies, explicit teaching of  Academic language used in problem solving, and an ENL-infused content area curriculum. ENL and classroom teachers jointly  plan and assess instructional and language goals to meet the needs of the ELLs.  ENL teachers are given the opportunity to  attend workshop offerings from OELL and CUNY NYSIEB when offered.   Title III funds have been set aside for workshops and teacher resource guides that showcase the very best reading strategies  for English Language Learners. These workshops are turn-keyed to the staff via Professional Development days and grade level  teacher team meetings.  Six topics of Professional Development have been planned, devoted to instruction of ELLs by the  classroom teacher. The Professional Development is done by the ESL teachers of the school. The following are some of the  topics covered:         1. Understanding the Language Progressions         2. Supporting Bilingualism: Translanguaging in Curriculum and Instruction         3. Academic Language and the CCLS         4. Guided Reading - ENL Strategies for Success in Reading.         5. Vocabulary Development         6. Integrating Language and Content Instruction  Professional development includes scaffolding methods that will provide ELLs access to the complex texts in the Common  Core. Teachers of ELLs work with the curriculum to enfuse ENL strategies that will help students reach the CCLS.           Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

Parents of ELL students receive a Language Development  Progress Report three times a year, that is aligned to their level of proficiency. The parents home language  will be considered before the meeting in order to provide appropriate translation, either by a staff member  or the translation over the phone system, as needed.  , testify that the following ELL identification procedures and  activities are adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.   The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62              Part VI: LAP Assurances   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63      from  8:00  AM   to  11:00  AM,   from  November    Classes  are  held  each  Saturday,   School  Name:       Our  school  recognizes  that  newly  arrived  immigrant  children  and  their  parents/guardians,  bring  with  them  a  wealth of knowledge of language and culture.  PS153’s Title III program provides ELL parents/guardians with the opportunity to  learn the English language through the Saturday Inter-generational Academy classes. The Saturday Inter-generational Academy  classes are held for the parents/guardians of ELL students. In this program, parents of ELLs have the opportunity to attend with  their children and receive intensive ENL instruction that links their learning to their children’s learning in reading, writing, listening  and  speaking.   An  appropriately  certified  ENL  teacher  provides  parents  with  English  instruction  that  addresses  their  language  needs.  through  May.          P.S. 153Q uses the Home Language Survey to determine the primary language spoken by the parent of each student enrolled  in  the  school,  and  if  such  language  is  not  English,  whether  the  parent  requires  language  assistance  in  order  to  communicate  effectively with the school.  With this information, oral and written translation services are provided so that parents are involved  with their child’s educational growth.  Translation services also allow parents to be actively involved in voicing their concerns at  PTA functions, parent/teacher conferences, etc.  A bilingual social worker is available to meet with ELL parents to provide them  with assistance in any area of concern.   The social worker also  provides outside agency resources for parents in need of crisis  intervention.          P.S. 153Q provides ELL parents/guardians with the opportunity to attend a variety of family literacy and math workshops, so  that they can better assist in the education and learning of their children at home.  A series of three, two-hour workshops will be  held  on  different  topics  (times  to  be  announced)  to  accommodate  different  schedules.   Three  workshops  will  address  the  following:  parents will be coached in how to use math strategies in problem solving; parents will become familiar with the ENL  learning standards and NYSESLAT assessment; and parents will become familiar with the Common Core Learning Standards in  Literacy  and  Math.   The  ESL  teachers,  Parent  Coordinator,  and  the  Math  and  Literacy  coaches  will  facilitate  these  parent  workshops.  Classroom  teachers  of  ELLs  also  have  workshops  for  their  parents  during  the  allocated  parent  time  on  Tuesday  afternoons.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      P.S. 153Q uses the Home Language Survey, given at the time of enrollment, to determine the primary language  spoken by the parent of each student enrolled in the school, and if such language is not English, whether the  parent requires language assistance in order to communicate effectively with the school. The school maintains an  appropriate and current record of the primary language of each parent. Such information is maintained in the  cumulative record cards, in ATS and on the student emergency card.           2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community.

The Home  Language Survey  identifies the primary  language of our 1343  students. Spanish, Polish  and Arabic are the major  languages spoken at  home of students who  attend our school. Other  languages include:  Albanian, Bengali,  Bosnian, Bulgarian,  Burmese, Cantonese,  Chinese, Czech, English,  French, Greek, Hungarian,  Indonesian, Italian,  Mandarin, Nepali,  Portuguese, Romanian,  Russian, Serbo-Croatian,  Slovak, Thai, Ukranian,  Urdu, and Vietnamese. Of  the 359 Spanish speaking  parents 188 require  translation and  interpretation services.  The Home Language  Report indicates that  there are 267 students  whose home language is  Polish. Within this  language group, 99 Polish  speaking parents require  oral and written  translation services. The  HLS has shown that the  covered languages of  parents that require  language assistance  services in the form of  both written and oral  translation services, in  addition to Spanish and  Polish, are Arabic and  Chinese.            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67     3.

As per the Chancellor’s Regulations A-663, P.S. 153Q provides each parent whose primary language is a covered  language and who require language assistance services with a copy of the Bill of Parent Rights and Responsibilities,  which includes their rights regarding translation, and interpretation services.    For all meetings involving our parents, our school posts in a conspicuous location at or near the primary entrance, a  sign for the covered languages, indicating the availability of interpretation services. Translated signs, in the covered  languages, are downloaded from the central translation unit. The school’s safety plan contains procedures for  ensuring that parents in need of language assistance services are not prevented from reaching the school’s  administrative offices solely due to language barrier.
