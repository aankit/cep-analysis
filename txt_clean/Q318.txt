This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      The Waterside School for Leadership believes that high expectations for all, balanced with support and care, lead to  the success of our scholars. These high expectations mean that scholars exhibit leadership in three ways: Leading their  Lives, Learning and Community. They become leaders of their lives by building upon, displaying, and discussing value  systems and ethical behaviors. In our our school and classroom environments, scholars role play and interact with  others as independent and committed problem-solvers, effective communicators and responsible, caring citizens.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      These skills are also demonstrated through a variety of required activities which include public speaking during  community meetings, participation in student government and other school activities, and yearly portfolio  presentation to an exit panel. Many scholars lead their own learning by working with teachers and parents to develop  learning goals every two weeks. As self-aware scholars, Waterside scholars articulate their needs and seek out  assistance to reach these goals. Lastly, scholars are leaders in their community by engaging in community service and  service learning projects. These activities foster authentic learning experiences within a real-world context and  encourage a stronger sense of social responsibility and civic awareness.         2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   The Waterside School for Leadership is a small middle school located in Rockaway Park, NY. Waterside, along with its  parents and community members, is dedicated to serving the diverse scholars of New York City by creating a  collaborative and supportive educational environment. College bound scholars in grades 6-8 are "Leaders of their  Lives, Learning and Community". Waterside fosters in our scholars a sense of community, an understanding of  leadership and a commitment to ethical behavior that encourages them to become positive change agents in high  school, college and beyond. We strongly believe that our children need a welcoming and supportive setting to  develop intellectually, culturally, and socially.   Waterside has multiple programs to support this development. To meet the needs of our scholars- especially those  with emotional disabilities, we have created partnerships with ArtistYear and the Child Center of NYC to provide  scholars with strategies for building artistic, academic and social-emotional competencies. They provide sports, art  and dance activities for our scholars during and after school. They also facilitate book clubs that support literacy  development both after and during the school day. Our school is also excited to continue our partnership with the  Middle School Quality Initiative to prepare scholars for college and career success. Our participation in the  Chancellor’s College Access for All initiative has been hugely successful as it aligns with activities that our school has  promoted since its inception. Our scholars discuss colleges and visit campuses every month to support early college  awareness. These partnerships and organizations provide support to our students, staff, and families through college  planning, Professional Development, workshops and other unique offerings. We believe that addressing our scholars’  social-emotional needs, exposing them to college early and fostering interest in various enrichment activities will  result in increased scholar engagement, satisfaction and academic progress.      Academically, the Waterside School for Leadership works annually to revise our comprehensive curriculum which is  aligned to the NYS Common Core Learning Standards and is transitioning to the Next Generation Learning Standards.  Our teachers work collaboratively to establish lessons and units that support the development of creativity, the ability  to think critically and problem solving skills. They use data to drive instruction and make instructional changes. This  yea, our school has partnered with DataCorp to provide teachers with assessment schedules and data analysis  training. Teachers also look at scholar products, listen to scholar discussions using accountable talk and review unit  data while implementing supports from different curriculum resources to improve their units of instruction, quality of  the text dependent questions and pedagogical practices. While Waterside primarily utilizes Scholastic Code X and Go  Math, teachers also use supports for vocabulary like Word Generation and Quizlet. Reading comprehension is  supported by online programs like MYON while mathematics utilize standards based programs like IXL.com. Our math  teachers have attended training with Algebra for All to redesign the way we conceptualize mathematical questions.  Our Science classrooms have worked to integrate the Next Generation Science Standards and the Elevate curriculum  program while our Social studies team has transitioned to Passport to Social Studies. Our work is supported by the use  of technology. We are also the beneficiaries of Reso 8 council grants that have helped to supply our school with  laptops, computers, IPADS and Promethean-boards for every classroom. This allows our school to fully integrate  technology in our classrooms and provide challenging interdisciplinary learning opportunities. Waterside uses Google  Classroom and Drive daily to enhance instruction and teacher collaboration.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Waterside scholars also have weekly enrichment opportunities. Our WSL Enrichment program allows our scholars to  explore and learn from each other while participating in different activities and programs. They self-select new  programs 2 times a year. Many of the groups present during family events and demonstrate their various skills from  their chosen enrichment groups.   As per our last Quality Review, the Waterside School has high expectations of the entire staff, effectively  communicates expectations connected to a path to college and career readiness to families, and establishes a culture  for learning that communicates high expectations for all scholars. Teachers support these efforts through  collaboration and teacher leadership positions to promote shared leadership for all. The Quality Review notes that  teacher leaders facilitate teacher reflection and challenge teachers to rethink their approach to planning. They  encourage peer-to-peer collaboration to improve learning outcomes for scholars which has resulted in school-wide  instructional consistency and coherence. This consistency supports mastery of academic goals for various groups of  scholars.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Our school has a high special education population. More than 35% of our scholars are identified as scholars with  special needs. In addition, our school has seen an increase in our ENL population with families entering the  neighborhood from various cultures and countries. In the past, our families were from Spanish speaking countries. We  have seen an influx of other languages including Arabic and Russian creating the need for additional parental  translation support and ENL classroom support.           4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Last year, Waterside focused on the use of formative assessments to adjust curricula and instruction, and revising our  formative assessment practices to reflect the use of ongoing checks for understanding. Our work centered around  checks for understanding, use of traffic light assessments and exit tickets to determine mastery. Our work was  supported by our use of technology systems like Google drive, plickers, and IPads. Because of this focus, our school  realized that many of our scholars struggled with understanding what questions were asking because they struggled  with the vocabulary. In the 2018-19 school year, Waterside intends to continue our work as we deepen scholar skills  by increasing time on text and improving mathematical problem- solving with an underlying emphasis on vocabulary  to support those goals.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  The school administration is cognizant of the fact that it is located in a hard to staff, high need community. As such, it  is important that the school works diligently to ensure a consistent and exceptional learning environment. Possible  candidate resumes are obtained through assistance from the district's Human Resources Director and the Open  Market System. The Principal and/or designee will continue to attend Job Fairs conducted centrally and throughout  the Region. Our school has also advertised in local papers, recruited through universities, and worked closely with the  Central DOE Office of Recruitment and Professional Development to obtain the services of qualified Teaching Fellows,  Teaching Candidates and TFA candidates.       Prospective teachers go through a rigorous interview process. All must possess the required licenses for their  particular assignments. In fact, we currently recruit teachers who hold multiple certifications across grades and  content areas in order to ensure flexibility and ability to assign teachers to their licensed area. Once resumes are  selected for interviews, the school’s hiring committee convenes to conduct the interviews.       The hiring team consists of teachers and the administrative team. Once candidates are interviewed, their interview  responses are graded using a rubric. The hiring committee then selects the candidates that they would like to conduct  demonstration lessons. The demonstration lesson is conducted in a class on the grade level of the vacancy. The hiring  committee will then make a selection based on the initial interview performance and the demonstration lesson  performance. Prior to hiring a candidate, the teacher's credentials are verified by our district’s HR Director to ensure  that the candidate holds valid state certification in that license area.      Lastly, the BEDS survey is reviewed periodically to ensure that every teacher’s assignment aligns with their license  area so that all teachers are reported as Highly Qualified.        2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34      Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   Waterside teachers are recognized for exemplary practices and contributions. They participate in grade level and  inquiry meetings focused on improving instruction. Teachers are given access to professional texts and other related  material to support their professional growth.       Waterside has ensured that a Professional Development Calendar for the school year has been developed. The  calendar includes professional development workshops and activities to support all staff members in assisting  scholars in achieving the Common Core State Standards. To support the use of reading and math curriculum resources  that are aligned with the Common Core Standards, teachers and administrators participate in on-going training in the  use of these materials throughout the year. School administrators participate in DOE/ District PD as well as on site  based workshops with teachers. Through feedback provided from informal and formal observations, the specific  professional development needs of individual teachers will be identified and met .        Part 3: TA Schools Only   3a.

Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      Time is spent during faculty meetings, cabinet meetings and subject team meetings to allow all stakeholders to take  part in the decision-making process regarding the selection and use of assessments. During Teacher Team Meetings,  teachers are given focused support from the school Data Specialist on how to use student data results to improve  instruction .        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Verify with an (X)   Column B   Section Reference(s)  Section 5A, 5B, 5C,  5D, 5E, 7, 8               Section 5A, 5B, 5C,  5D, 5E, 7      Title I Part A (Basic)   Federal   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local   13,540      0     0    0    1,978,899      X               X        1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36     conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)       The Waterside School for Leadership believes that parents and families are an integral part of our scholars’ success.  We know that it is we can create a collaborative and supportive educational environment only along with our parents  and community members.

The overall aim of our Parent Involvement policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure  effective involvement of parents and community in the school. Waterside in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title  I, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent  involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the  families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision- making in support of the education of their children. Holding this belief, parents are encouraged to actively  participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers  and welcomed members of the school community. To support a healthy school- home relationship, the Waterside  School for Leadership agrees to implement the following regulations:   1.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Our school uses NYSELAT data, state test scores, DRP for 6th grade and Scantron Perfomance Series provides various data  points for our scholars.  The NYSLAT data provides us with information about our ELL's listening, speaking, writing and reading  skills. The tests scores from the state assessment also provide us with a detailed item analysis which we can use to direct our  instructional choices.  The DRP for the 6th grade consists of chosen nonfiction paragraphs or passages on a variety of topics.  It  proviodes us with information about a scholar's reading levels, areas of difficulty and independent vs, instructional  levels.  These data points are checked against the Scantron Performance series which provides information about where  scholars are compared to the district, state and national levels, learning objectives and grade level equivalency scores.    Teachers then use this data to drive instruction; formulating differentiated groups within their classroom as well as sharing the  information with the ENL teacher. The data is used to create lesson plans that will increase the scholars'language acquisition,  thereby increasing their academic performance overall.   Students are grouped accordingly within the classroom environment and groups change based on skill, topic and proficiency.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Our school uses google drive to share data with school stakeholders.  In addition, our school hosts PLC and content areas  meetings each week where teachers including our ENL teacher work to disseminate data and determine program efficacy.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Our school will evaluate success by the number of studente making AYP for ELLs.  We will also compare the levels that  students scored last year on the NYSESLAT and NYSITELL as to the year before and this year.    Students receive progress reports every two weeks in addition to the report cards.  This assists in tracking students' progress  frequently to see how they are performing.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Our school provides AIS services twice weekly for students.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Paste response to question here:        6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The NYSESLAT data shows that ELLs are making incremental gains on the assessment by moving to the next proficiency level to  become language proficient. ELLs who are in the beginning level are mostly newcomers.  A review of the various data points  indicates that our scholars struggle with writing and reading skills hence our instructional program focuses on these skills.     For those that are not newcomers and still receiving services, the data indicates that their writing skills are what is holding  them back from obtaining proficiency.  Within our curriculum we are focusing on writing across content areas and having the  students able to express themselves in written form.        7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Our school uses google drive to share data with school stakeholders.  In addition, our school hosts PLC and content areas  meetings each week where teachers including our ENL teacher work to disseminate data and determine program efficacy.            Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Our school's ELLs are grouped in general education classes and are supported with push-in/ co-teaching ENL  instruction throughout the week. Beginners and Intermediate students also receive periods of pull out to focus on  reading, writing, vocabulary and speaking.   Scholars are grouped according proficiency level (Beginners, Intermediate,  and Advanced) to make sure that the content designed for their language acquisition and learning level will be  appropriate for them and they receive the mandated weekly minutes.  . The ENL teacher pulls out 5 to 7 scholars per  group for instruction.     There are classes on each grade level which contain the ELLs in order to utilize the push in  model and adhere to schedules and minutes.     b.  TBE program.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              Our ELL scholars who are entering and emerging receive 360 minutes of ENL instruction per week with a ½ or full unit of  stand alone ENL.. They will also receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL. Inside of the 360 minutes.  Transitioning and expanding  will receive 180 minutes of ENL instruction a week to include mandated time frames of integrated ENL. ENL instruction is  conducted in the English language with references made in Spanish, Arabic and Polish. This time is allocated so that ENL  scholars will be serviced by a certified ENL teacher during the humanities period in addition to stand- alone services.        3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      The ENL teacher plans and meets with each content area teacher during the week to support their instruction.  The teacher  uses textbooks in spanish for the various classes to support their learning.  Inaddition, teachers work to do the following:  -  Integrate themes across classes so that language is reinforced   - Provide small group learning with dual language partners to facilitate academic discussions   -Create literacy-rich environments with age- and grade-appropriate texts    -Offer translated texts as a support:        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      Scholars will be assessed by daily teacher observation, self-assessment, performance assessment, and portfolio assessment.  Our teachers assess their children’s reading ability throughthe Scantron performance series program and DRP.  Reading levels  are viewed and analyzed for trends and patterns. The ENL teacher will collaborate with the classroom teachers of ELLs to  ensure that they will meet the standards and pass the required assessments. All the ELLs will take the New York State English  as a Second Language Achievement Test (NYSESLAT) to determine their progress and eligibility for the next school year.         5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Plan for Newcomers  When a new scholar is registered in our school, we provide the following resources to facilitate the transition.  • An informal scholar orientation  • Buddy system identifying a similar scholar in his/her class that will assist during the day  • Encourage scholar to participate in the Saturday Program and After School activities.  • An informal assessment is provided to identify possible Academic Intervention programs.  • Home school communication.     Plan for Developing  ELLs and Former ELLs:  • All ELL students are invited to the afterschool program where they can receive additional support from the ESL teacher.   Also, we have Saturday Academies where teachers service the ELL populations and all are invited to attend for Saturdays  starting  in December. Our teachers tap into the different learning modalities during instructional time in order to assure all students  are   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      learning. ELLs are also part of any of our content based support such as that for Science or for Social Studies.      Plan for Long Term ELLs:  An analysis of the scores for long terms ELLs on the NYSESLAT, ELA and Math assessments suggests  that   their problem is one of reading and writing. Our action plan for this group involves.   • An after school program, targeting reading and writing three days during the week.  Use of Word Generation vocabulary program    • Monitoring the progress of scholars in all content areas to differentiate instruction for literacy needs   • Saturday Academy      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   The ENL teacher uses differentiated instruction and varied instructional strategies to meet the language needs of ELLs- SWDs  and to develop their lifelong skills. Such approaches are as follows:     a.     The language experience approach: This will enable scholars to develop academic skills through listening, speaking,  reading writing, and thinking with focus on teaching the structure and convention of the English language.   b.     Through hands on activities like field trips, projects, and scientific experiments, scholars will have the opportunity to have  real life learning experience and better understand the concepts presented in the curriculum.  c.     Technical Support through computer and audio cassette. Scholars are given the opportunity to work in the computer as  well as use books on tapes to expand scholars’ learning experience. In an effort to raise learning standards, the ENL teacher  uses a variety of online programs, online literature, audio cassettes, graphic organizers to allow concepts to be taught in a  concrete dimension       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Teachers spend time during grade level meetings to review scholar IEPs and progress.  Scholars who are able to do so are  moved into a least restrictve environment with supports as aligned to their IEPs.  Our school then constructs schedules for  each scholar to meet their individual needs.          8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  All instructional components will be taught in the English language. In an effort to develop the language skills and fluency of  our ELL population at M. S. 318, we will use the Workshop model which follows all the balanced literacy components,  (researched-based), such as Read Aloud, Shared Reading/Writing, Independent Reading/Writing and Guided Reading/Writing.  In addition to the Model, we will incorporate audio/visuals, listening centers, big books, charts, graphic organizers, and  manipulatives. Teaching strategies that will be used to meet the different needs of our ELL students are: modeling, total  physical response, repetition, hands-on instruction, small group instruction, individualized instruction and pair share activities.  Our English Language Learners will be encouraged to participate in the Test prep classes and the after school small group  instruction with a focus on differentiating instruction.         9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      WSL is considering the use of the TheSys ELLoquence.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   Our school no longer uses Acuity online programs.  We are switing to schoolnet to meeet the needs of our schools.       11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?

We have extended day for our ELL students.  We also offer  reading turoting and HW help for all of our students including ELLS. Middle School 318 in conjunction with Child Center of NY  afterschool Programs will provide a vibrant after school program for all scholars. The program will be instructional.  It will assist  scholars with math and ELA. All English Language Learners will be encouraged to attend.  ELL scholars are enrolled in  supplemental AIS programs such as Ticket to Read, a computer based program for struggling readers.  ELL scholars participate  in various activities such as soccer, math club, performing arts club, ELA/ Book club, chorus, technology club and Saturday  Academy       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Our school uses audio devices, computers, smartboards, headphones and more to support students. We also use translated  texbooks, dictionaries, glossaries and other tests to support them.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:                                                                                   School DBN:     Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
