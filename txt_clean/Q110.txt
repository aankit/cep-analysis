This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?      Section 4: CEP Overview      We believe that all children can learn. We believe that all children have great potential to be happy and successful.  We will provide our students with a safe and loving school environment so that they are free of worry and able to  focus on discovering, exploring and learning. Through highly-qualified teachers, rigorous instruction, structured play,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      parental involvement and ongoing support, our children will become life-long learners and expert problem-solvers of  the future.       2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    PS 110 is a K-5 school with high academic and social expectations for all students. We are a school where all school  members respect one another. We provide a safe and nurturing school environment where everyone knows everyone  in our ‘home away from home’! We are proud of the fact that we provide a curriculum that educates the whole child  – academically, socially, and creatively.   This year we will focus on our bottom third across the grades. We will have a full time AIS/RTI teacher that will work  with our bottom third students to increase student outcomes. We are working this year to increase student  achievement across the grades. Our focus this year is around rigorous instruction and how this relates to student  achievement for our bottom third.    In the 2017-2018 school year, we introduced new curricular programs. We are continuing to work with Teachers  College Reading and Writing Project (TCRWP). Through this curriculum tool we are continuing our work in balanced  literacy and writing instruction. TCRWP offers teachers units of study aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards  while providing students with a broad exposure to various types of reading and writing experiences. Second, we  adopted the Wilson FUNdations program in grades K – 2; it is being used with third grade students who are identified  as struggling or at – risk as part of our Response to Intervention (RtI) plan. During the 2014 – 2015 school year we  piloted the program to see the impact it would have on our struggling/at – risk students as part of the Academic  Intervention Services (AIS) plan. In addition, to build the student's oral and written language, we introduced a  vocabulary program, Wordly Wise, for grades K through 5. Last school year, we also introduced a new math program- Go Math! Through this curriculum tool we are continuing our work around our engaging and interactive approach to  learning math.    Additionally, we have bilingual programs in our school community. We also established a Dual Language program for  Kindergarten through Fourth grade classes. The addition of these programs will offer families more options under the  bilingual education umbrella. Families who do not want their child in a bilingual program will still have the option of  push in/pull out English as a New Language (ENL). This year we are establishing a bilingual bridge class for our K/1  special education students. In addition, we are introducing a new program for Dual Language word study-Palabras a  Su Paso-which will assist students in their decoding and spelling skills.    An emphasis on intensive and ongoing professional development in many areas has effectively improved our literacy  and math programs. The principal, assistant principals, and teachers in leadership roles provide extensive professional  development with an emphasis on balanced reading and writing. Interclass visitations have been scheduled so that  our teachers may improve their pedagogy by observing their colleagues. In mathematics, our emphasis continues to  be on making math language connections, the workshop model, and lesson development using the GoMath! program.  Our plan is to maintain the goals of our Professional Development Program and to include future topics as follows:   · Fountas and Pinnell Benchmarking   · English Language Learners: Classroom Strategies to Help ELL Students Succeed   · Teaching Reading Strategies through Guided Reading   · Developing Math rigor to engage students   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      · Special Education: Utilizing the CCLS checklist in Determining Promotional Criteria   · Teacher Team Planning: Designing and Upgrading Curriculum Maps in Literacy and Math   · Wilson FUNdations   -Wordly Wise   We have also provided staff development in the following areas:   · Danielson: Student Engagement and Questioning and Discussion Techniques   · Guided Reading as a tool for success   · Go Math!    · Thinking Maps   · Teachers College Reading and Writing workshop            3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Our school has a large ELL population and a growing population of SWD.   Many of our English Language Learners come in with a lack of foundational skills, which is why we implement  programs like FUNdations. These students often go home and only hear Spanish. This makes learning English  challenging because they only hear it and see it in school. There is a need to build talk and conversation from our  students, to give them the confidence that they need to build their English skills.   Our Students with Disabilities have challenges that include retaining information that they have learned and using  what they have learned to build on other foundational skills. Other challenges include English as a second language  and having special needs that make it difficult to build language acquisition. Some students also have trouble building  relationships with other students because of social challenges. We work hard on making PS110 an accepting  community to all of our students.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   One of our most enjoyable accomplishments is around our strong family and community ties. This year we have a  number of programs, workshops and celebrations that actively involve our parents and educate them around  curriculum and culture. Student of the Month and Quill Award winner celebrates the academic and social growth of  the students and is celebrated at our PTA meetings with the students and parents. We have a full time Parent  Coordinator to help with parent involvement. We also have conducted workshops around the CCLS and will continue  to provide workshops to educate the parents on the curriculum of the school and how to support their children at  home. Information about their child’s curriculum is also shared through the Newsletter that is sent home seasonally  by the teachers in both English and Spanish. We also host Coffee and Conversation once every month to discuss  parent concerns and updated school information.   A key area of concern is the achievement of our Lowest Third and our Special Education students. Many of our special  education students are a part of the lowest third subgroup. Presently, we have eleven collaborative team teaching   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      classes and four 12:1:1 classes. We have a full time SETTS/RTI teacher. We continue to analyze our yearly data for  each ‘Special Needs’ child in order to have accurate data and information to develop the Individualized Education Plan  at annual reviews.

Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     P.S. 110 is a community; and as such, decisions and discussions regarding the use and selection of assessments are  part of a collaborative and consultative process including the administration, consultation with teachers, the  Instructional Leadership Team, the Measures of Student Learning (MoSL) Team and the School Leadership Team.. The  following are examples of collaborative assessment decisions:   When making assessment selections, all teachers in grades K-5 participated in a survey that focused on rating the  value of each assessment and the frequency with which each assessment should be administered.    Teacher Team Meetings have, and will continue to, address the use of Performance Tasks, benchmark assessments  and curriculum based assessments to assess progress towards meeting the Common Core Learning Standards.      School based surveys have guided decision making regarding Internet Based tools and interventions purchased for the  school (BrainPop,)        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)    Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 110, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   P.S. 110's Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program.

P.S.110Q will target 60 ELLs with a NYSESLAT level of entering, emerging, and  transitioning, including newcomer subgroups.     According to 2016 NYSESLAT and 2016 NYSITELL scores P.S.110 has twenty-three  kindergarten students at the entering and emerging level, nineteen 1st graders at the entering and  emerging level, fourteen 2nd graders at the entering and emerging level, and fourteen 3rd and 4th  graders at the entering, emerging, and transitioning level.     The program will focus on oral language, and digital storytelling.  The purpose of the program is  to build language and vocabulary orally, and then transfer those skills to literacy, while  incorporating technology.     The Title III program will be held after school on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:20-  4:00p.m.  Each day 5 ESL and bilingually certified teacher will provide instruction to  approximately 60 students from K-4.   Bilingual teachers will also provide home language  support in Spanish as needed.  The Title III program will run from November to April.     The four teachers will have five groups of students: 2 kindergarten groups, one 1st, one 2nd  grade group, and one 3rd/ 4th grade group.   There will be approximately 15 students per group.    Instruction will focus on English oral language development through drama, technology, and  balanced literacy.   Students will participate in digital storytelling through narration, animation,  and filmmaking.   Students will begin storytelling by adapting familiar material digitally, such as  folktales and other authentic children’s literature, and will gradually be guided to create original  material.  Students will be exposed to various methods of digital storytelling, and will be able to  choose what they want to use to publish their own stories.     By the end of the program students will create two to three projects: a blog, an animated short,  and short film or movie trailer.  The blog will retell a familiar story by creating diary entries  from a character’s perspective.   Student’s animated piece will be an adaptation of a familiar  story, where students can change the setting, characters, or resolutions to make the story their  own.  The short film/ trailer, which students will shoot and edit, will be an original story.  Kindergarten students will focus on the animated short and film, older students will also be able  to create a blog.    Money will be allocated for materials such as: online subscriptions, digital cameras, student texts  for read aloud, guided, shared and independent reading and art supplies.   Online subscriptions will include: GoAnimate, a digital storytelling tool, and KidBlog.org for  publishing online blogs.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51            Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   Students will also participate in 2 or 3 field trips during the school day that will be tied to drama  and storytelling.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?        3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56         4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Literacy skills of students K-5 are assessed using Fountas and Pinnell running records in English and Spanish, sight word  identification, and letter name and sound identification.  Teachers use state assessments such as NYSITELL levels for new students, data gathered through MOSL, ELA, and the state  Math exam.  Teachers also use teacher made assessments such as on-demand writing assessments and baseline math  assessments to guide instructional planning for ELLs.        5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   New teachers receive training on administering running records and other Fountas and Pinnell assessments.  All teachers  participate in professional development to norm scoring on running records.   Teachers work together on and across grades to create baseline math assessments and on-demand writing prompts in order  to provide continuity.  Teachers are provided additional time and/ or assistance to complete assessments when necessary.  Teachers are provided  with pacing calendars for the school year with due dates for assessments.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   We use formal assessments as well as informal assessments such as checklists and rubrics for each unit of study to accurately  evaluate our ELLs’ progress.  Through these interim assessments we evaluate students’ progress by noting which students  have met unit objectives and use the data to inform instruction.  In addition we use NYSESLAT results to evaluate the success  of our programs for ELLs, and EL SOL to monitor progress in Spanish.  We will use the information provided to guide specific  instruction and professional development for staff.     Math benchmark assessments are also used quarterly to determine progress and area of need. Math is a content area that  continues to require students to learn specific academic language. The quarterly assessments provide a measure of where ELLs  struggle as well as where they excel.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Students who are not meeting benchmarks in reading, writing, and math receive academic inventions to support their  learning.  Classroom and ENL teachers provide support in the classroom using appropriate small group interventions  recommended in the PRIM guide.  Students are met with regularly and their progress is assessed.  Students who continue to  struggle receive support from AIS teachers.     * Inquiry teams on a weekly basis  * Grade meetings  * Teacher evaluations  * RtI           Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57         a.  Freestanding ENL program.   P.S. 110 implements an RTI model that consists of small group instruction throughout the school day (AIS).  All  students (including ELLs) were screened based on end of year F&P levels and performance on the MOSL writing  task.  Students targeted for RTI receive services by teachers identified to provide tier two and three support to  struggling learners in reading and/ or writing.  Our RTI model uses Fundations to target early readers and guided  reading for higher-level readers. Students’ progress is monitored using running records and on-demand writing  samples.      Universal screeners establish a baseline of student performance and identify students who are not making academic  progress at the expected rate.  If an ELL is flagged as at-risk in a particular skill, that student receives targeted  instruction to improve that area.  Classroom and ENL teachers take into consideration the student’s ELL status,  language competencies in the home language and English, and student’s schooling history.  ELL students receive  support in English and their native language where necessary.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Last year’s NYSESLAT data showed great gains in proficiency level and a large number of students who scored  commanding.  The data reveals that our focus on writing and language objectives across content areas has had a  positive impact on student academic achievement, specifically our ELLs, as measured by the NYSESLAT.  Areas of focus  continue to be writing and reading to move into more abstract texts and concepts.  In the 2015-16 school year 78  student were entitled to English language service according to the NYSITELL and 58 students scored  commanding.  Out of the 78 eligible students 37 students scored entering, 15 students scored emerging, 16 scored  transitioning, and 9 expanding.                NYSESLAT, ELA, and Math state exams data are all used to evaluate and inform student success within the ELL  programs at P.S. 110Q.  We use the EDAT (ELL Data Analysis Tool) to predict student outcomes as well as to determine  areas of need. Additionally, informal teacher assessments, writing samples, peer conversations, conferencing with the  teacher, end of unit assessments, Fountas & Pinell reading assessments are used to track student progress and  program viability.   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      All classroom, ENL and cluster teachers are made aware of students NYSESLAT, ELA, and Math scores at the beginning  of the year.  Students are grouped appropriately within their ENL program to best support their academic needs.    During weekly inquiry, time is set aside to analyze state assessment data. Areas of strength and needs are identified  and a plan is developed to address student need(s).   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   1.    In the freestanding ENL program at P.S. 110 we service students according to the number of mandated minutes calculated  by their NYSESLAT scores and CR Part 154.  Students who score entering or emerging on the NYSITELL of NYSESLAT will receive  a total of 360 minutes of ENL, divided between stand-alone and integrated, the amount of each is determined by their  level.  Transitioning and expanding students will receive a total of 180 minutes of integrated ENL.  Commanding level students  also receive two years of integrated ENL for 90 minutes a week for two years after they pass the NYSESLAT.  Stand-alone ENL  for entering level ELLs will be primarily pull-out to target language needs of students in consecutive grades.  Integrated ENL is  push-in to language arts or a content area class.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   For the kindergarten, first and second grade dual language class there are two teachers: one English speaking and one Spanish  speaking.  There are 50 students between the two sections of the class and midway through the day they switch, receiving half  their instruction in English and half in Spanish.  Students receive ENL services from their ENL certified English language  teacher.  Classes are comprised of half English dominant, half Spanish dominant students.  ELLs are heterogeneously grouped;  both classes containing students of various proficiency levels.  The third grade dual language class will be taught by one  bilingually certified teacher.  Students stay in their class and 50% of the instruction is in English and 50% Spanish  instruction.  Content areas are taught in both in English and Spanish.        5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.             Based on students NYSESLAT scores they are given a proficiency level of: entering, emerging, transitioning, expanding, or  commanding.  Student who score as entering receive 180 minutes of standalone ENL and 180 minutes of integrated  ENL.  Students who score emerging receive 180 minutes of standalone ENL and 180 minutes of integrated ENL.  Transitioning  and expanding students receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL, and commanding receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL for two  years after passing the NYSESLAT.   ENL instruction is provided by certified ENL teachers in the ENL and dual language programs.  ELA instruction is provided by  the classroom teacher.  HLA instruction is provided by the classroom teachers within the dual language program.  50% percent  of instruction in DL is Spanish, students receive approximately 200-300 minutes of HLA weekly.         6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?    In the ENL program core content is delivered in English by ENL teacher, or by both a classroom and ENL teacher using the co- teaching model.  Lessons are scaffolded to make the content comprehensible for ELLs by using thinking maps, visual aids, and  first language support.  Teachers activate background knowledge of a topic to increase understanding and language is fostered  through explicit vocabulary instruction.  Student discussion in the ELL classroom helps reinforce new concepts and  vocabulary.  All instruction is aligned to common core standards.  In the dual language programs content, such as science,  social studies, and math is also delivered in both English and Spanish.  Teachers use Go Math in Spanish to compliment the  English math curriculum and model Spanish science and social studies after curriculum in English, FOSS.           7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  When students are first identified as ELLs Spanish speakers are tested using the Spanish LAB exam to identify their first  language skills.  For beginner ELLs Spanish is used, as necessary, to assess understanding of content orally and written, where  possible.   Student's Spanish reading skills are evaluated using Fountas and Pinnell in the dual language program, assessing fluency,  accuracy, comprehension, sight word knowledge and phonemic awareness.  The kindergarten and 1st grade dual language  classes also use Estrellita which evaluates student’s early literacy skills in Spanish.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Students who have been identified as SIFE will receive response to intervention services as well as extra minutes of ENL where  possible.  Instruction of newcomer ELLs is differentiated by grouping students during literacy to focus ENL services to focus on  beginner language skills.  Instruction for developing ELLs includes continued support in basic language skills and explicit  vocabulary and language instruction in content areas.  Former ELLs are serviced for 90 minutes a week in content areas to  continue to develop vocabulary and academic language.    Former ELLs also receive testing accommodations for two years  including extended time, separate location, and option to use bilingual glossaries for assessments.  There are currently no long- term ELLs at P.S. 110        9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      All ELLs and SWD at P.S. 110 are instructed using grade-level materials.  Teachers of ELLs and SWD make content accessible by  providing language supports for students.  Grade-level TCRWP and Go Math curriculum are supported with vocabulary  instruction, and language structure supports such as sentence starters or frames, and thinking maps that support  understanding and support oral and written language development.  Technology is incorporated whenever possible, so  students can participate in Promethean board activities,  use computers and iPADs to research, watch videos, and note-take.  Administration, the IEP/ SETSS teacher and ENL teachers meet on a bimonthly basis to review IEPs of ELL SWD students to  ensure all students are receiving all services.  Teachers of ELL SWD students have access to big books and guided reading books  in Spanish to supplement instruction in the first language as needed.  When students are mandated bilingual special education  services, alternate placement paras are assigned as needed and work with the children to meet their needs, as we do not  currently have a bilingual special education at our school.           10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   ELL-SWDs are serviced through self-contained ENL and push-in ENL whenever possible to keep students in their classroom,  with a special education certified teacher for as much time as possible.  Instruction is differentiated according to the needs of  the student as identified on their IEPs.  Additionally, the curriculum is scaffolded to support students as per their IEP while  maintaining alignment to the CCSS.  During pull-out instruction ELL SWDs are grouped with non-disabled ELLs to maximize time  spent in diverse settings.  During bimonthly special education /ENL meetings we discuss and explore flexible program options  for students to ensure students are in their least restrictive environment and meet their individual needs.      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  P.S. 110 implements an RTI model that consists of small group instruction throughout the school day (AIS).  All students  (including ELLs) were screened based on end of year F&P levels and performance on the MOSL writing task.  Students targeted  for RTI receive services by teachers identified to provide tier two and three support to struggling learners in reading and/ or  writing.  Our RTI model uses Fundations to target early readers and guided reading for higher-level readers.  Students’ progress  is monitored using running records and on-demand writing samples.  Intervention related to language supports will be put into  place to support language during concentrated small group instruction.  Vocabulary and comprehension will be addressed  through tier one instruction using vocabulary instruction, read alouds, and guided reading.  According to our initial findings using MOSL data, F&P running records, teacher observation, and last year's NYSESLAT results,  our area of focus will be reading and writing.  Our ENLs area of need is ELA, specifically reading and writing.    With our entering and emerging ELLs we use Fundations and monitor through end-of-unit assessments.  This data is then used  to make curricular adjustments as needed.  With our developing and transitioning ENLs guided reading is implemented during  RTI time, through the use of running records we monitor this data in order to make curricular adjustments.  ENLs in need of intervention services in math, meet with our RTI teacher and/or instructional coach to hone in on specific skills  based on teacher observation, assessments, and math MOSL data.  A pre and post test are used to measure progress.  Bilingual staff are utilized as much as possible in RTI to provide first language support in content areas.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  P.S. 110Q will continue to grow our dual language program to 3rd and 4th grade in the 2017-18 and 2018-19 school years.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   No program/ services for ELLs at P.S. 110 will be discontinued at this time.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    ELLs are afforded equal access to all school and after school programs.  In addition to those offered to all students, ELLs and  former ELLs are invited to participate in our Title III  after school program.  Our Title III after school program incorporates  language, literacy, content area instruction.  The ELL coordinator ensures that all targeted ENL students are invited to  participate.  There is also a ELA and math test prep after school that ELLs were invited to as well as music and arts after school  which ELLs also participated in.    During breakfast in the classroom we are building on oral language using open-ended questions with sentence starters and  linguistic frames.  P.S. 110 also partners with Studio in a School to educate students about art through the use of visuals,  vocabulary, and hands-on learning.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    ELLs are instructed in their classrooms using the same instructional materials as their English proficient peers: Teacher’s  College Reading and Writing Project, Fundations, and Go Math.  Go Math in Spanish is used in our dual language and bilingual  programs and FOSS materials are translated into Spanish by our science teacher.  Students have access to Spanish language  materials through their ENL, bilingual or Spanish teacher as well as the school library.  ELLs are also supported whenever  possible through technology such as Imagine Learning software.  ELLs specifically are supported through instruction using  thinking maps, explicit vocabulary instruction and language supports to target transitioning and expanding level ELLs.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   First language support is delivered in the ENL program model using translations when necessary and first language  instructional materials.  In dual language students receive literacy and content instruction in Spanish.         17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    ELLs are serviced in the ENL program through a push-in model whenever possible in order to keep them in their appropriate  grade and class.  When pulled out students are in small groups of no more than two contiguous grades.  All dual language  classes have are one grade per class.  All materials correspond to the age and cognitive needs of the students.      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   ELLs are instructed in their classrooms using the same instructional materials as their English proficient  peers: Teacher’s College Reading and Writing Project, Fundations, and Investigations for  math.  Investigations in Spanish is used in our dual language and bilingual programs and FOSS materials  are translated into Spanish by our science teacher.  Students have access to Spanish language materials  through their ESL, bilingual or Spanish teacher as well as the school library.  ELLs are also supported   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61         whenever posible through technology such as Imagine Learning software.  ELLs specifically are supported  through instruction using thinking maps, explicit vocabulary instruction and language supports to target  transitioning and expanding level ELLs.      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  New students were distributed materials during summer registration in preparation for the following school year,  including  the book "Kids Learn! Getting Ready for (K/1/2/3) Grade".  All materials distributed corresponded to the age, grade and  cognitive needs of the students.  Parents were also provided information about local summer programs to support their  children prior to the start of the school year by the ELL coordinator and guidance counselor.         2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  No language electives are offered at P.S. 110 at this time although the dual language program offers Spanish language  instruction to both native and non-native speakers.          Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Our dual language program in kindergarten, 1st and 2nd grades use a side by side model with one English teacher and one  Spanish speaking teacher.  Students receive 50% of instruction in Spanish and 50% in English in both literacy and content  areas.  Teachers use the ‘rollercoaster model’ where students spend one complete day in English class and the next day in  Spanish class, switching back and forth to balance literacy and content instruction in both languages, simultaneously.  Our third grade dual language program is self-contained.  There is one teacher who provides both English and Spanish  language instruction.  This teacher also balances instruction 50/50 in both languages for content and literacy.  All ELLs in dual language classes are serviced by an ENL provider if their English language teacher is not ENL certified.         2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  There are three professional developments planned for teachers of ELLs for the 2017-2018 school year.  Teachers, the assistant  principal, paraprofessionals, psychologists, guidance counselors, speech teachers, and OT/PT providers will be in  attendance.  One PD is aimed at new teachers, and non-ENL teachers to introduce them to the terminology and identification  process of English language services and programs. The second PD will introduce strategies and teaching methodologies that  benefit ELLs.  The PD will focus on scaffolding, using thinking maps, the importance of activating prior knowledge, and explicit  vocabulary instruction.  The third in the series of ELL PD will focus on tier II vocabulary instruction.  Teachers will identify what  tier II words are, why they are important, how to provide opportunities for students to practice the words, and the importance  of multiple exposure to new words.    Additionally, teachers will be given opportunities to attend PD provided by OELL throughout the school year.  As part of our  support for the growing dual language program we will be scheduling inter-visitations to schools with existing programs as a   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62         form of professional development and support for the teachers.  During Monday PD time, PD is provided around meeting the  needs of ENLs by the ELL coordinator along with administration, and dual language teachers work together to provide  differentiate PD to the entire staff, including paras, and OT/ PT providers.    Psychologists, OT/ PT, parent coordinator, speech and secretary are also sent for outside teacher specific to ENLs.      Teachers at P.S. 110 also attend weekly meetings with the literacy coach to discuss reading and writing instruction aligned to  the CCLS.  Development is focused on ELLs as a subgroup we are targeting for continued literacy development.   Meetings will  focus on scaffolding TCRWP units of study to meet the needs of ELLs.   For example, incorporating thinking maps into reading  and writing mini-lesson; using thinking maps to teach academic vocabulary, incorporating sentence starters and linguistic  frames to build genuine conversation.      Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.    P.S. 110 is committed to meeting the required percentage of professional development hours for teachers of ELLs and teachers in  other areas of licensing.  Half of all professional development will be devoted to topics specific to ELLs including the  aforementioned series of PDs on ELLs.  PD will be differentiated by content and sub-group (ELLs and Special Education).  We will  also be taking into consideration teachers’ years of experience to support them.  In the staff handbook teachers can submit  professional development interest forms so teachers may request topics that they have an interest in or areas they would like to  focus on.  PD for teachers by teacher is an opportunity for teachers to serve as leaders in an area they feel is a strength to support  their colleagues.  All PDs are aligned to the Danielson framework, common core, and city-wide instructional expectations.  Agendas  and attendance are kept for all professional development activities.                         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63              Part V: ELL Identification Attestation   Principal Certification   In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, All parents of ELL students will be invited to meetings with their child’s ENL,  bilingual or dual language teacher to discuss goals of their program, language development progress, and  language proficiency assessment results, during Tuesday's parent engagement time.  Teachers will explain  the student’s NYSESLAT results from the previous year, show parents the language goals the student is  expected to achieve in the current school year, and provide information about ways parents can support  their ELLs at home.   Translated materials will be made available to parents.  Meetings are conducted in  English and Spanish.  In addition to the Tuesday meetings there will be 2 to 3 additional meetings targeted  to the dual language families to discuss the goals, expectations of the program, and the supporting  research., testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to and staff are trained on the  following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    2.   3.   4.   5.  6.   7.   8.   9.   The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64             12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Our school staff works carefully to foster relationships with parents so that they are comfortable expressing their  needs to staff.  Parents are invited to participate in open school week where they can visit their student’s classroom, they are  invited on field trips with their child’s class, and they are invited to events held throughout the school year such as the Hispanic  Heritage concert, and Community Friday.  Dual language teachers will also hold meetings to discuss upcoming units of study, and  ways to support their learners at home in two languages.  All families, including parents with ELLs, are invited to Winter and Spring  concerts, and to participate in Learning Leaders, a volunteer training program where all parents can train to become volunteers in  the  school.  This year we are working with Maspeth town hall to offer adult ESL classes to parents of ELLs.  We will continue to research other  CBOs  year.   Any programs offered at P.S. 110 are directly linked to feedback we have received from parents.  Workshop topics are also decided  by  the  parent  survey,  and  in  the  past  have  included  technology,  child  abuse,  bullying,  TCRWP  workshops,  Common  Core  for  parents,  others.
