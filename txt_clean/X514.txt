The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7     In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           8       NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9        Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           10      Section 4: SCEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Bronxwood Preparatory Academy’s Mission Statement is as follows: Our School mission is to educate all students to  become academically successful while meeting and surpassing the New York State Standards. We envision a dynamic  learning environment where ideas are shared, mutual respect is given, and diversity is appreciated. With the support  of an innovative staff, in partnership with home and community, we will create and develop a community of lifelong  learners. In support of this mission, BPA will continue to sustain a pilot for a blended learning community and expand  for the SY2018-2019 to prepare our students for the technologically necessities of success in college and career.       2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    The student population at The Bronxwood Preparatory Academy (BPA) is diverse and uniquely representative of  different populations. Of the 344 students currently enrolled, 62.8 % are Black, 26.5 % are Hispanic, and 6.0 % are of  other descent, including many that have emigrated from various foreign islands. We have 30 % students with  disabilities, 6.5 % that are English Language Learners, and 59 % of our students receive either free or reduced lunch.  On the campus, students have available to them, the Morris Heights Clinic that supports their health concerns and  that also provides seminars on a variety of teen appropriate topics. In SY1819, we will continue to partner with  Fordham University for instructional coach support and Apex will be our online course platform partner. BPA has  partnered with other new programs that support our instructional and social needs of our student population which  include AVID, One Goal and Peer Group Connections (PGC). We continue to offer various clubs, academic supports  and college and career readiness trips and seminars. This allows for our school to move forward in creating a level of  blended learning in targeted classrooms for this upcoming year. In an effort to serve the whole child for the 21st  Century, we continue to partner with organizations and implement our College Access grant through planned  activities to help us provide academic and social opportunities for our students and parents to create a school that  prepares students for college and careers while extending the school as a place of safety and engagement. This year  we are launching our new PBIS rewards program to help improve our school culture, decrease school incidents and  increase an appreciation for diversity amongst the staff, students and community.      As the Common Core exams continue to roll out for the next few years, our curriculum continues to be re-written to  alignment with the state to increase student success in the Common Core Standards with the final assessment data in  the content based testing. Our entire curriculum is Common Core aligned with the shifts incorporated into this  education road map.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Presently, BPA is populated with approximately 30% Special Education Students. We have also received a number of  ENLs from other countries which include Jamaica, Mexico, Dominican Republic and Yemen. To support our students,  we have a Special Education Teacher for each core content area that meets daily with the content team to review  data and scaffold all materials. As well, we have two more Special Education Teachers that specialize in literacy, one  of which also teaches a technology class for Special Education students to prepare students for college and career. We  have two ENL teachers supporting our ENL population in free standing classes as well in the core content classes  working with the general education teachers. Two special education teachers are facilitating a class for college and  career readiness for our Special Education students. A transition team has been established to support students and  their families as each student progresses through their high school programs and on to higher education. Data for our  special needs and ENL students is reviewed for Regents results and with every scholarship report to assure their  status for “on-track” status to graduation. These tallies assure precise programming and targeted interventions for       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           11      CCLS academic success as represented in standardized testing. Additional tutoring is offered to these population to  help them with the State examinations and coursework.    Title iii funding is used to further support our ENLs transition into our school system and prepare for graduation.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Within the Framework for Great Schools, BPA has made progress in all areas of the Framework. Areas of greatest  progress have been in “Rigorous Instruction” and “Collaborative Teachers” with an effective rating overall in  professionalism. Professional Development in Webb’s DOK and Danielson Framework for Teaching has been our  targeted drive and will continue into SY2018-2019 supporting our collaborative focus on engagement and rigor  primarily through 3B, Questioning and Discussion and supporting literacy through close reading, vocabulary and note  taking skills. The APPR for teachers overall showed increases in all Danielson Framework components with 3b,  Questioning and Discussion. Although increasing, it still remains the most challenging component along with 3C  Engaging students in learning and will therefore be our focus for SY18-19. All data is disaggregated by general  population, special education and ENL students, to continually measure students’ progress toward graduation via  increased Regents pass rates and credit accumulation. Overall, BPA’s outreach efforts have shown a positive impact  on student attendance in school and ELT opportunities. Through a combined focus of developing teacher pedagogy  and concentrating on improved curriculum that is both rigorous and engaging, student response, both socially and  academically has shown growth and preparedness for college and career.

Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           46      Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     The decision making process and professional development for teachers at Bronxwood Preparatory Academy is as  follows:   Teachers receive Professional Development on multiple assessment measures including MOTP impact.   Professional Development covers all testing options and transitional periods/tests from Regents to Common Core  testing.   Common assessments are generated through the teacher teams. Castle Learning is an online software option for this  purpose that teachers have access to at all times. Families and students can also access this web tool for information  and assignments.   Bronxwood Preparatory Academy has worked diligently on a system of Regents itemized data standard output and  analysis that is done post all Regents including the extrapolation of SWD and ENL data for comparison.   School wide areas of challenge are identified and pedagogical interventions established to support student success.   Rubrics are content specific and shared school wide to create an evaluative process that is consistent and familiar to  students increasing assessment criterion amongst students.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           48        Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.          2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           49      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Bronxwood Preparatory Academy , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title  I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Bronxwood Preparatory Academy supports parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           50      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community.            Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability  grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;        2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           51      ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report,  Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the ESSA;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between /teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.             2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           52   School-Parent Compact (SPC)      School-Parent Compact (SPC)       Bronxwood Preparatory Academy, ], in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student  Succeeds Act (ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student  achievement between the school and the families.

The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.   Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs.  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.     Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high  academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.   1.  2.  3.  4.  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on  the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”   1.   Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term  workshops and conferences.    Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet  community needs.    1.   These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.      NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional  development, and 20% to OTPS.       For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and  Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

State Language Standards in all subject areas.  The data shows  that  our students struggle with academic language in the content areas and therefore struggle  passing  assessments in these classes.  Therefore the program will provide an instructional plan  that will target the skills necessary to build academic vocabulary as well as enhance interpersonal  communication skills through blended learning platforms (Google Classroom, Brainpop, ESL  Library).  The teachers will model the use of academic language in ways in which students will  be expected to participate, and instructional strategies and activities will reflect language  development research.  This program will offer the required prior knowledge students will need  to succeed in their high school careers as well as introduce them to technologies used in the  world.    Rationale: The goal of this program is to help students meet the New York State language  standards across the content areas and ultimately to improve scores on the N.Y. State Regents  examinations as well as NYSESLAT.

Proposed Supplemental Instructional Activity #2    Regents Preparation Program:  The program is targeted for our ENL students in the 9th - 12th grade at all proficiency levels  (Entering - Commanding) who are enrolled in English and/or Science courses, which lead up to a  New York State Regents examination and/or ENL students who have yet to pass the ELA and/or  Science Regents.  Regents content area teachers will collaborate with ENL teachers to provide  regents based work for the program.   Any English/Science teachers used for collaboration are at  no cost to Title III.  The data shows that our ENL students struggle with passing these Regents  exams and therefore the program includes components of essays, research reports, creative  writing; mock testing, science research and Regents study skills.  Every student in this program  will receive a Regents practice guide for Science and/or English and will receive Regents  preparation assignments during the sessions. In addition, students will receive individualized  instruction, small group instruction and literacy focused writing that will prepare them for the  English Language Arts, and Science Regents.  The goal of this program is to equip all students  with the necessary higher order thinking skills with special focus on science and research skills  along with reading, writing, speaking and listening skills required to meet commencement level  state learning standards.  The Language of instruction for the Regents Preparation program will be English with Spanish  support.  The ESL library program itself also support multiple languages.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  We use formative assessment data gathered from blended learning platforms such as Achieve 3000, Castle Learning, Google  Apps for Education and Scantron Performance Series to identify areas of need and to build on areas of strength. The use of  graphic organizers and school wide instructional strategies such as turn and talks, frequent checks for understanding, and  school wide exit-slips are also used on a daily basis as formative assessments.  The data gathered is used to help guide ongoing  instructional planning for ENL students. Additionally, we have established a common differentiation section in our lesson plans  to help individualize instructional planning for ENL students. Lastly, content specific tracking tools have been collaboratively  created to aide instructional planning through quantifiable day-to-day data. Looking at student data helps our community to       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           64      identify the skills students are most struggling with and helps us differentiate our curriculum to ensure multiple entry points.  This allows students to acquire content specific vocabulary and literacy skills.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Structures that are set in place to support this effort include daily teacher team meetings where teachers share best practices  and analyze common assessments to further guide instructional planning. Also, curriculum development and refinement is  ongoing and updated from one semester to the next. School wide instructional strategies that include the use of graphic  organizers, think-pair-share, turn and talk, frequent checks for understanding and exit slips are also used to support this effort.  Adjustments for differentiation are also included in all lesson plans to help support instructional planning. Lastly, rigorous  professional development is also provided on formative and summative assessment as well as on ENL differentiation and  teaching ENL subgroups.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We look at the scores generated by the NYSESLAT, NYSITELL, Spanish LAB and Regents Exams and extrapolate that information  to see if individual ELL students are progressing or digressing in the four modalities. We also look at the information provided  to us by periodic assessments as well as alternative assessments and online platforms such as Scantron's Performance Series  and Achieve 3000. Additionally, we use teacher generated baseline/benchmark assessments that are created departmentally  and used to identify and progress in areas of need. The data patterns across proficiency levels indicate that our students  struggle most with the reading and writing sections of assessments specifically in the Math and ELA content areas. On a school  level we frequently check with content area teachers to ensure that students are maintaining and progressing with their basic  interpersonal communication skills and cognitive academic language. Report cards and progress reports are closely monitored  by the ENL coordinator to ensure that students are on task and acquiring enough credits for graduation. The ultimate goal for  ENL students is graduation as well as proficiency in the English language as assessed by the NYSESLAT and/or ELA Regents.            4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Structures that are set in place once summative data has been gathered includes proper scheduling as per CR Part 154 for  students with ENL services.  Title III supplementary programs are also established to help ENL students by providing them with  a more personalized learning environment after school. Saturday and PM academies are also offered to all targeted students,  including ENL students, in need of intervention.  Once areas of weakness are identified through the summative data, we  provide targeted professional development to assist teachers with pedagogical strategies and to identify best practices to  address interventions. Ongoing feedback through the observation cycle is also used to target school wide needs based off of  summative data. We have also created department wide tracking tools to assist with creating a more individualized  intervention system for ENL students. These tracking tools are used by the ENL teacher in co-teaching classes as well as in the  freestanding classes. Lastly, we use online platforms such as Skedula to monitor and track student achievement and to  communicate with parent/guardians the interventions the school is providing for students.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The data patterns across proficiency levels on the NYSITELL and NYESESLAT reveal that most of our students still struggle with  reading and writing skills. Their BICS (Basic Interpersonal Communication Skills) are generally a lot more advanced than the  CALPS (Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency Skills). Patterns across the NYSESLAT modalities will affect instructional  decisions in that teachers will focus on improving a student’s lowest modality while maintaining and also improving their       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           65         highest modalities as well. Teachers will be able to target specific areas such as reading and writing, and help improve student  outcomes as well as proficiency levels. According to the Spring 2016 NYSESLAT results and 2016-2017 School Year NYSITELL  results proficiency levels in the speaking modality are a strength.  The data also reveals that we need to continue to improve  proficiency levels in writing in across all grade bands. Furthermore, we also use the Regents scores as outcome assessments to  evaluate and inform ELL program which includes specific instructional strategies that are launched across content areas to  support ELL’s.  These strategies include the use of visuals, collaborative and active content vocabulary, the use of graphic  organizers, and the use of common rubrics.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?  One of the structures we have set in place to disseminate findings is our ENL Guide for teachers compiled by the ENL  coordinator. This is distributed by the ENL Coordinator every semester. Included in the guide is pertinent information on all  ENL students in the school including data that can help drive instruction. At the start of each semester, the ENL coordinator  collaboratively schedules all students with the school programmer based off of the assessment data. Other structures in place  include targeted professional development led by the ENL coordinator and/or the ENL teacher on topics such as  differentiation, using blended learning platforms to help all students succeed, and how to identify and support sub-groups  within the ENL population (SIFE, ENL SWD's, Gifted and Talented ENL's, Long-Term ENL's, Newcomers, etc.). Lastly, ongoing  communication in person or via e-mail between the ENL coordinator, school administration, teachers, guidance counselors and  the school programmer assists in disseminating pertinent information in order to adjust programs.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Bronxwood Preparatory Academy has a freestanding ENL program based on program choice forms and the number of  ELL's enrolled in our school. We follow a co-teaching model of integrated services as well as stand-alone classes  where needed.  Integrated and standalone ENL classes are implemented as per CR Part 154.2.  Integrated ENL units  are delivered mostly through the ELA classes but also through several other content area classes as needed. The  program model is a heterogeneous model in that mixed proficiency levels travel together. Furthermore, all ELL  students within a grade level travel together. The stand-alone classes are also heterogeneous and are comprised of  mixed grade-levels based on scheduling needs.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?      The school ensures that the mandated number of instructional minutes are provided according to the proficiency levels in  our Freestanding ENL program by adhering to CR Part 154.2 regulations. In the freestanding ENL program we provide all  entering students with three units of study a week, one of which is a stand-alone ENL unit, one of which is an integrated       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           66      ENL/ELA unit and one of which is an integrated ENL in Core Content Area unit.  All emerging students will be given two units of  study a week, one of which is a stand-alone ENL unit and one integrated ENL/ELA unit.  All transitioning and expanding  students will be given one ENL unit of study in a Core Content Area. Commanding students will be given at least .5 units of  study in integrated ENL in a Core Content Area.        3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   All classes are taught with native language support. Content area classes are all taught by licensed content area  teachers, who have been involved in both internal professional development and have also been briefed in grade level  meetings on the needs of the individual ENL students in their classes. They work to differentiate their instruction to facilitate  the lower level ENL Students’ comprehension, and are offered help by the ENL specialists with individual cases. Content level  classes are taught in English, and content area resources are provided in English with native language support. Students have  access to the specialized ENL library, which consists of teaching aids in content areas, specifically focusing on Global Studies  topics, an area in which ENL students have shown a lot of weakness in the past. Students are also provided with bilingual  glossaries and in Regents classes teachers are strongly encouraged to give students any practice Regents work in the native  language as ENL students have the right to take all Regents (except of the ELA Regents) in their native language. Students also  have access to content-area individualized tutoring, as well as Regents level tutoring by ENL specialists. Native language  support in the content area is provided through the use of translation services on the internet as well as bilingual glossaries,  dictionaries and any books that can be purchased in the native language. The ENL teacher provides content area support by  enhancing CALPS for ENL students in the stand-alone ENL classes. This is done by collaborating with content area teachers on  what cognitive academic language proficiency skills need to be addressed for success in the content area. All content is  scaffolded and differentiated to help make content accessible for all students at all proficiency levels. Graphic organizers,  modeling, turn and talks, daily exit slips, and frequent checks for understanding are some of the common strategies used to  foster language development for ENL students. ENL teachers also co-teach in the English classes to help enhance English  proficiency and to scaffold instruction within the English department. All lessons, unit plans and curriculum are rigorous and  aligned with the CCLS focusing on the learning shifts such as critical thinking skills, argument, and informational texts.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?         Students are appropriately evaluated in their native language by ensuring their entitlement to translated Regents exams,  glossaries and other pertinent evaluatory materials.  The ENL department makes sure to disseminate memos and bilingual  glossaries to content area teachers and ensures that all ELL's are provided with translated Regents exams.  The Spanish LAB is  also used to evaluate ELLs in their native language.        5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    (a) BPA services provided for our SIFE students include one-on-one tutoring and after-school help.  The administration also  makes every effort to inform the faculty of our SIFE students and strategies that will assist the faculty in dealing with them.  SIFE students will be provided with the opportunity to attend a NYSESLAT Prep class and various Regents Prep classes after  school.  SIFE students are given all of the regular ESL accommodations, in addition to individualized programs to help with  specific needs, whether they are college-based, Regents-based, or content specific. Additionally, they have access to the ESL  library, which is specifically geared towards SIFE students, and supplements content-area texts in subjects such as Global  Studies and Earth Science. In the classroom SIFE students are closely monitored to ensure that sufficient understanding and  comprehension of the materials being taught is taking place.  Classroom teachers use a multitude of strategies to ensure that       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           67      SIFE students are given the best instruction available.  Prior knowledge is activated on a daily basis to help students relate and  make connections to the materials being taught.  We encourage all teachers to use plenty of visuals and graphic organizers to  reinforce what is being taught.  We also provide ample opportunity for SIFE students to use various technologies in order to  help them get familiar with a technology driven society.  Building the native language is also encouraged by the use of bilingual  texts and by creating cooperative group learning experiences where lower level students are paired with higher level  students.  We have purchased a high interest-low reading level library to help assist SIFE students struggling with the reading  component of the NYSESLAT.  SIFE students are tested by using Scantron performance series and Acuity.  Based on their  results individualized teaching plans and techniques are implemented to assist their needs.     (b) Our plan for ELLs in the country less than three years includes access to 540 instructional minutes per week of instruction  with a certified ESL teacher, access to additional tutoring services before and after school, access to our ENL library and online  resources, and additional individualized plans to suit their future goals, whether this be a Regents or NYC Diploma.   In addition  to instruction on language development and cultural awareness, students are provided instruction with the goal of simplifying  language and amplifying content.  Strategies include hands-on demonstrations, opportunities for role play, journal writing  using native language or pictures.  Students are taught basic vocabulary and are provided print rich materials to support their  oral language development.  (c) Our plans for ELLs receiving service from 4 to 6 years includes a push to advance or test out of the program on the  NYSESLAT exam; to accomplish this, we provide one-on-one NYSESLAT tutoring after school two times per week, as well as in- class instruction. Students are also encouraged to complete work at or above grade level, in the mainstream environment.  Students strengthen their language acquisition skills.  Instruction focuses on explicit vocabulary building and intensive  academic literacy skills building.  Teachers across content areas incorporate building skills for reading and analyzing  informational texts, as well as writing opinions and arguments in response, in their instruction.   (d) Our plan for the long term ELLs involves a similar push to advance or test out of the ENL program, if their English levels  have advanced to proficient, and they can succeed at the mainstream, grade level. To accomplish this, we provide one-on-one  NYSESLAT tutoring after school two times per week, as well as in-class instruction.  Instruction includes: expand on figurative  languages study, strengthen academic language skills, focus on reading and analyzing non-fictional texts and writing  opinions/arguments in response, and strengthen note-taking skills working with extended reading and listening passages.  In  addition to explicit vocabulary building and intensive academic literacy skills building, counselors and school support staff offer  intensive social-emotional support to Long Term ELLs.  (e) Our plan for ELL's in years 1 and 2 after testing proficient is to provide them with the mandated support services for former  ELL's that are in years 1 and 2 after testing proficient on the NYSESLAT.  We provide them with all the testing accommodations  required for ELL students.  Wherever possible we also keep them scheduled in the same content area classes as the ELL  students.  This allows for teachers to differentiate instruction to ELLs and former ELLs.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   All ELL-SWDs are served as per their IEP in the least restrictive environment.   The ENL teacher collaborates with the Special  Education department on a daily basis to ensure that students work on leveled reading programs that are rigorous and  grade/age appropriate aligned with the CCLS.  Access to dictionaries, Rosetta Stone, picture dictionaries and content specific  bilingual glossaries is readily available in all classrooms to help facilitate and accelerate English language acquisition.  ALL ELL- SWDs have access to the computer lab or computer carts to access translation services as well as bilingual texts. Where  applicable, special education students are given resource room as a support class and also attend self-contained classes in the  content areas with licensed special education teachers. All special education students are given the same instructional services  as their peer general education ELLs.  Our plan for ELLs who have been assessed as having special needs includes a close  collaboration with the Special Education department to identify and work with their particular accommodations. These  children are serviced by both the ENL department and the Special Education department, and a collaborative approach is  taken to their advancement and eventual mainstreaming. Differentiated instructional techniques are used in the class to help  assist the students with comprehension and understanding.  Based on their IEP and collaboration with the IEP coordinator,  instruction is tailored to meet the students’ language needs as well as providing support with any cognitive needs the student  might have.   We encourage all teachers to use a variety of differentiated instructional approaches such as, but not limited to,       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           68      the use of manipulatives, graphic organizers, visuals, engaging prior knowledge, rewording texts, group work, etc.  After school  tutoring is also available to all ELL special education students to help assist with homework, language needs, and any of the  modalities they might be struggling with. All special education ELLs are also tested using Scantron Performance Series and  Acuity.  The results generated by these exams helps create tailored instruction for each student as well as allowing teachers to  see potential gains or areas of need for each student.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  All ELL-SWDs are placed in the least restrictive environment as per their IEP.  The ENL teachers, special education teachers, and  content area teachers collaborate in weekly inquiry teams, grade and department meetings to discuss and share students'  progress in order to ensure that each SWD-ELL is afforded instruction appropriate to his/her language and learning needs and  to help achieve their IEP goals.  The ENL coordinator, special education coordinator and programmer meet on a weekly basis to  ensure and maintain flexibility in scheduling so that ELL-SWDs are placed in the least restrictive environment.  Our certified  ENL teacher's schedule is flexible enough to allow him to provide ENL instruction to ELLs during the regular school day through  a push-in/pull out model (through regularly scheduled classes as well as through tutoring sessions during the school day).     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Our targeted intervention program for ELLs in Math, ELA, and other content areas includes grade level meetings with content  teachers to collaborate and identify students who need extra help or are at risk; a mentoring program to provide at risk  students with additional support; accessing ARIS and other technological tools to aid in developing background information to  make informed decisions; and working closely with the guidance department and the inquiry team to identify and encourage  alternative educational programs if the situation calls for them.  Most intervention services are offered in English with the  option of translations being made available when necessary.  The ENL coordinator also frequently checks with the ELA, Math  and other content area teachers to evaluate student progress and to monitor targeted intervention for students at risk.  The  intervention services offered at our school range from: after school tutoring sessions (Regents and NYSESLAT), Saturday  academies, credit recoveries (during school breaks), and mandatory tutoring to pulling out specific students from content area  classes targeting their Math and ELA proficiencies. Students are regularly scheduled for AIS tutoring with specific content area  teachers based on their needs.  Native language support is offered by the staff in all targeted intervention programs to help  facilitate and foster language acquisition and understanding.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      For the upcoming school year, we will be continuing to target full compliance with servicing our ELL population. We will  continue to offer both stand-alone and co-teaching classes for our ELL population. Based on data and trends we will be  offering blended learning opportunities for ENL students which will included access to Achieve 3000, Apex, Castle Learning,  and Google Apps for Education. Additionally, we will be bringing on board three organizations to help all student in the social-  emotional aspect of their education. These programs include Onegoal NY, AVID, and PGC. We also continue to offer Regents  Exam tutoring services, as well as NYSESLAT Exam tutoring, for our ELL’s after school, for one hour a day, two times per week  (offered by the ENL teachers). PM school is also available with content teachers after the instructional day. We will also be  targeting multicultural learning experiences out of the classroom with content-focused field trips, to museums and to cultural  attractions in New York City.  Professional development for content area teachers regarding ELL strategies will also be offered.  Staff members are given training in periodic professional development seminars, held both on-site and off-site, throughout the  year. These professional development opportunities are hosted by both the content-area staff members, as well as outside  consultants and specialists.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           69      All school programs, during and after school, are open to our entire student body. Sports, including basketball, lacrosse, track  and field, soccer and volleyball, are open to all students, including the ELL population. They are able to join any clubs being  offered during and after school. ELL’s are able to attend PM School and any tutoring services offered before and/or after the  school day. Supplemental services include Title III programs, and after-school tutoring and Regents Prep tutoring. Ells are made  aware of all school programs available to them by written and verbal communication from the ENL office in English and in the  students' native language.  At BPA we make it a priority that all ENL teachers encourage ELL students to join school programs  allowing them to be involved in the broader school community. Parents are also advised of the options available to their child  by the parent coordinator.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Instructional materials used to support ELL learning include the use of internet in the classroom to access translation services  and to assist in the native language with vocabulary, grammar, reading, and pronunciation.  Audio-visual presentations in the  classroom are used in combination with traditional text-based approaches to target all learning modalities.  Blended learning  platforms such as, Google Apps for Education, Castle Learning, Achieve 3000, Avid and departmentalized online learning  programs. NYSESLAT Exam Preparation books, Regents Examination Preparation books, personal teacher libraries of grade- level fiction and non-fiction books; content-specific textbooks, and library resources brought into the classroom to enrich the  learning experience are also readily available for instructional support.  ENL teachers also have audio-visual carts readily  available for use to help enrich the learning environment for ELL students.  ENL teachers and content area teachers have all the  above mentioned resources available to them including a SIFE library, bilingual glossaries and bilingual dictionaries.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Native language use is encouraged in both the formal and informal settings with our ELL population. Newcomers are often  paired with intermediate and advanced ELL’s, who contribute in supporting and translating with their native  languages.  Informally, the students communicate extensively in their native languages, and are taught to appreciate and  celebrate their home cultures through a variety of multi-cultural projects. Students are also offered Regents exams in their  native language and are encouraged to use bilingual glossaries in all of their classes/exams.  The use of native language films is  also encouraged to help students celebrate and support their native culture as well. Teachers are encouraged to let their  students write answers in their native language which in turn are translated and graded by bilingual pedagogues according to  content knowledge. Students are also encouraged and allowed to use online translation services to complete tasks and help  support the native tongue.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All curriculum is designed with age and grade appropriate instruction and is aligned with the Common Core Learning  Standards. ELL services and resources support ELLs’ ages and grade levels by differentiating and scaffolding instruction, and by  using ESL teaching strategies such as modeling, the use of visuals and audio visuals, cooperative learning activities, and  alternative assessments. ELL’s are given the same access to support services, regardless of age or grade level.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Resources and coordinated efforts in the building include integrated sports teams as well as inviting co-located schools to  celebrations such as drama productions, dance performances and other school performances.  Best practices are also shared  with the ENL coordinator from all schools.  Several ELL District PD’s have also been hosted on the campus.  A title III summer  enrichment program is also offered to all ELL’s building-wide.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Prior to the beginning of the school year, a meeting with the counselor, ESL coordinator, and programmer takes place.  The  ENL coordinator places the child in the ENL program according to his proficiency level obtained on the LAB-R, NYSESLAT,       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           70         and/or Informal Assessment.  Upon the start of the instructional year, students are presented with a program brochure, class  contracts, and parent contracts, in both English and their home language, to set expectations for the school year.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    The language elective offered to ELL’s at this point consists of Spanish.      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Professional development for ELL staff, which currently consists of Mr. Munting and Ms. Morel, includes access to content  specific ENL training hosted through the NYC Department of Education and periodic attendance at other DOE ELL Instructional  workshops off site. ENL teachers also host professional development for staff on subjects such as ENL subgroups, and  differentiation.  Training on ELL identification, placement and instructional strategies is offered to assistant principals, content  area teachers, special education teachers, guidance counselors, the office staff and the parent coordinator. We will also be  coordinating and implementing two professional development activities, the Teaching Content to English Language Learners;  and Literacy Across the Curriculum workshops with the in-school literacy team, consisting of administration, ELA teachers, ESL  teacher, and an outside consultant.  Professional development in the Common Core Learning Standards is done weekly for all teachers including ELL staff for the  purposes of reaching equivalent standards and producing CCLS worthy curriculum. Standards are reflected as a rubric and  utilized to measure the success of the students along the continuum for all CCLS adjusting for ENL students according to their  language proficiency. ELL personnel may attend monthly workshops offered by the Network ENL coach. ELL staff has the  opportunity for coaching with an independent ELA specialist as well for CCLS alignment and ENL/ELA credit bearing coursework  and support. ELL staff may select to go to various content specialty seminars for deepening understanding of the CCLS by  content areas. Conferences, both private and Department of Education generated, are available to the ELL staff upon request.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.      Many content-level staff members have been sent to DOE Literacy professional development, to assist in their handling of  ELL’s making the transition from the middle school level into the a secondary school setting. Staff members are also briefed on  the student levels of the ELL’s entering their classes, and co-teaching services are offered by the ENL department to content- level classes. Content level teachers are also briefed in grade-level meetings on the progress and status of ELLs. All staff  members including secretaries and the parent coordinator are given training in periodic professional development seminars,  held both on-site and off-site, throughout the year. These professional development opportunities are hosted by both the  content-area staff members, as well as outside consultants and specialists. Staff members have also been offered the       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           71         opportunity to attend a variety professional development opportunities regarding ELL strategies pertaining to content specific  classes.  Bronxwood Preparatory Academy will and has committed time, energy and resources to professional development  activities. The ENL coordinator is also in constant contact with content area teachers to help refine instructional strategies  specifically related to the ELL population. Throughout the year all staff members will engage in professional development  during mandated professional development hours to ensure that we meet requirements as per CR Part 154.2. 15% of total  hours for all teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers will receive ELL-specific professional  development.  In the past this has also been done by creating PLC’s with district support.  Records of these meetings are kept  in the Principals office. In the training all teachers of ELLs will be exposed to the following topics for the 2017-2018 school year:    •              Differentiated Instruction  •              Blended Learning  •              Writing strategies  •              Reading across subject areas  •              Group activities  •              Literacy approaches  •              Interdisciplinary approaches  •              Project planning  •              Strategies to increase student achievement  •              Classroom management    As teachers work to plan collaboratively, we will continue to focus on professional development to improve students’ reading  and writing skills. This year we have and will continue to create study groups with staff members to become more  knowledgeable on how to instruct ELLs and increase their language proficiency skills through different instructional tasks.         Parental Involvement      1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   The school will provide annual individualized meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs based on needs  assessments identified by the ENL Coordinator. These meeting will be held on a rolling basis throughout the school year and  include language translation where needed through the parent coordinator and/or an interpreter.  Records of these meetings  are kept in the ELL Coordinators office as well as the Principals office.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  Frequent communication is published, translated and mailed about school policies, news, and events. On the individual level,  the staff seeks information about the parents’ lives of our students (e.g., cultural heritage, socioeconomic background, literacy  level and household composition). Teachers listen to parents’ concerns while also focusing on the strengths families bring to  the community, such as language and culture. Finally, homework assignments and projects sometimes require students to  interact with parents and family, drawing on their knowledge. The parent coordinator facilitates the parent association, which  meets monthly. Through this forum, parents are encouraged to volunteer at Bronxwood Preparatory Academy during the  school day.  Our parent coordinator along with our ENL coordinator, also perform workshops specifically tailored to ELL  parents. The ENL coordinator actively pursues parental involvement through consistent communication with staff regarding  the academic as well as social-emotional development of ENL Students.  Peer volunteers will be assigned to serve as  Cooperative Learning Partners to LEP students in other classes. Parental involvement includes the school Parent Teacher       2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           72         Association, periodic parent-teacher conferences, and content-specific parent outreach programs that aim to involve parents  in their children’s education. These programs involve helping parents to understand graduation requirements, transcripts, and  resources available to them and their children.  Parents are also invited to attend other school activities that celebrate and  highlight students’ work such as the art show, poetry night, multicultural festival, and the drama production.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Janet Gallardo, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.            2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           75                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Bronxwood Preparatory Academy                                                                              School DBN: 514  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
