This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   All Bronx Green Middle School stakeholders will effectively collaborate and prepare every student with the skills and  knowledge to become exceptional learners and leaders. We will provide an environment conducive to learning in  which every student can advance academically, socially, and emotionally.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Bronx Green Middle School is a small middle school of approximately four hundred students that is located in the  north east section of the Bronx. Our school population is 47% male and 53% female. Our student body is composed  of 55% Hispanic, 0.5% Native American, 6% Asian, 2% Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, 22% Black, and 13% White. In  order to meet the needs of all students, Bronx Green stakeholders strive to work collaboratively and build teacher  capacity to support and increase student achievement.    In order to support the school’s mission and our student population, Bronx Green:   1.  Schedules 10 periods of ELA instruction per week for all students. Units of study are currently being   rewritten to reflect culturally responsive pedagogical practices and literature. Exposure to complex text,  rigorous questioning, and discussion techniques with appropriate scaffolding will support higher order  thinking skills.    2.  Schedules 10 periods of math instruction per week for all students. Teachers collaborate to modify and   scaffold instruction and design common assessments. Real-world tasks (aligned to the Algebra for All  initiative) and cooperative learning strategies support higher order thinking skills and student engagement.    3.  Supports differentiated instruction to improve reading gains. Bronx Green teachers implement   independent reading across the content areas in order to increase and maintain reading stamina.  Independent reading expectations include providing students with a purpose for reading and small group  instruction to advance learning. Small group instruction is the vehicle by which teachers deliver targeted,  scaffolded instruction for all learners.    4.  Believes that all teachers are teachers of literacy. Therefore, all content area teachers receive professional   development around high impact, cross-curricular strategies: R.A.C.E. writing (constructed responses),  Visible Thinking Routines, Reciprocal Teaching, Frayer Model (vocabulary), and close reading annotations.    5.  Believes collaboration is key to supporting instruction and student achievement. Thus, Bronx Green   teachers use protocols to refine academic tasks and analyze student work to inform instruction during  weekly content team meetings. Specifically, teachers share best practices to support diverse learners in  meeting the Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS).    With regard to the Framework for Great Schools: Collaborative Teachers, Bronx Green creates a unique scheduling  system in which all teachers participate in a minimum of three teams to analyze student and teacher work and  share instructional practices that support the school’s mission, instructional focus, and equity goal to advance  student learning.   1.  Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) - PLC leaders meet weekly with administration to develop and  refine a year-long professional development plan that engages all staff in clarifying the academic, social- emotional, and school cultural needs of traditionally underserved student populations. PLC cycles consist of  9-week rotations where faculty and staff engage in lesson studies, readings that promote racial literacy,  and Critical Friends feedback to assess the culture of the school. Findings are used to modify instruction,  curriculum, and establish systems and structures to improve the climate and culture of the school  community; thus, promoting equity and excellence for young men of color.    2.  Grade Teams - Meet semi-monthly to discuss students’ academic and behavioral progress and grade-wide  concerns. Teachers create intervention plans to support at-risk students’ progress towards mastery of the  CCLS. During Grade Team meetings, teachers collaborate to monitor students’ social and emotional  development, establish outreach to families to support students’ learning, plan enrichment activities,  incentive programs, and grade-wide trips in order to promote and engage students in learning.    3.  Content Teams - Meet weekly to analyze student work, enact interventions, refocus instruction, and plan   multiple points of entry to support the CCLS. Teams analyze assessment data, such as in-class assessments,  state exams, and MoSLs, to drive and modify instruction. During meetings, facilitators offer professional  development around the CCLS and culturally responsive pedagogical practices to norm team member’s   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      understanding of best practices. Teachers collaborate to refine units and lesson plans to ensure students  are making marked progress toward mastery of the CCLS.    To support college and career readiness for all students, Bronx Green will partner with the following NYCDoE  initiatives and community based organizations.   1.  College Access for All - As part of this initiative, Bronx Green students are encouraged to critically think   about their future and broaden their horizons when it comes to high school, college, and careers. All 7th  grade students are invited to college tours across the tri-state area and families attend workshops around  financially planning for college to support a college-going culture.    2.  Algebra for All - To support our students’ achievement in mathematics, during the 2017 - 2018 school year   Bronx Green joined NYCDoE’s Algebra for All Initiative. In 2018 - 2019, our first and second cohort of  teachers will continue professional development during the summer to expand their expertise in math  instructional practices and strategies. Ultimately, Bronx Green students will be better prepared to  successfully complete the Algebra I Regents by the end of 8th grade; thus, enabling them to reach more  advanced math courses in high school.    3.  Middle School Quality Initiative (MSQI) - To support our students’ achievement in literacy across the   content areas, during the 2017 - 2018 school year Bronx Green joined MSQI. In 2018 - 2019, teachers will  continue to receive professional development around culturally responsive instructional practices  necessary to increase the overall percentage of eighth grade students who graduate reading on or above  grade level.    4.  Bronx House - All Bronx Green students are invited to join our after school Bronx House School’s Out New   York City (S.O.N.Y.C.) program. Bronx House serves as a pathway to success for our students via rigorous  instruction in sports and arts and requires youth leadership through service.    3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.         Approximately 20% of Bronx Green students are classified as ENL students. This population includes newly arrived  students with interrupted formal education, as well as long term ENLs that have received ELL services for 6 years or  more. The proficiency levels of this population ranges from kindergarten to grade-level. Resultantly, our ENL  students are in need of explicit and integrated language instruction, as well as opportunities for them to utilize  their home language in meaningful ways. To help meet their needs, technology (i.e. iPads and Macbook Airs) will  be consistently incorporated in daily learning tasks/activities to differentiate and scaffold instruction. Additionally,  online interactive e-book libraries (Capstone Library) will be accessible so students can select books that match  their lexile level and interests.      Approximately, 21% of Bronx Green students are classified as Students with Disabilities (SwDs). This population  consists of students who are diagnosed with autism, learning disabilities, speech and language impairments,  intellectual disabilities, emotional disturbances, and other health impairments. This exceptional student population  possesses academic deficits of approximately 2 - 3 years below grade level in mathematics and ELA. The needs of  this population include equity within the classroom and throughout their schooling, teacher sensitivity towards  their learning deficits, the use of technology, repetitive teaching, low-level, high interest books, manipulatives,  reciprocal teaching practices accompanied with differentiated instruction, attendance support, and continued  support to address the social-emotional elements and societal issues that plague them.      4.

To continue supporting our development in this element, during the 2018 - 2019 school year  Bronx Green will consistently use the Coalition of Schools Educating Boys of Color’s Standards and Promising  Practices for Schools Educating Boys of Color Parent/Family/Community Partnership self-assessment tool during  designated Parent Engagement Time to identify external supports to further develop and implement structures for  communicating with families. Communication efforts will be centered around strategies that families can use at  home to help their children be successful in school and beyond.    Moving forward, Bronx Green’s key area of focus will be to continue developing Collaborative Teachers. We will  use Monday Professional Development time and structure Professional Learning Communities around building  positive school and learning environments for all students and in particular young men of color. An inquiry  approach will enable us to examine school structures and systems, generate timely data, and implement actionable  performance information to establish a school climate that fosters an engaging learning environment and improves  outcomes for our young men of color.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 11X326   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   395   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     According to the 2018 School Quality Snapshot Guide, 94% of students report that “they are learning a lot in their  classes at their school to prepare them for the next level or grade” and 86% report that their teachers want them  “to become better thinkers, not just memorize things.”   The same report indicates that 67% of students say “that they work in small groups”. Additionally, ENL and SwDs  made limited growth on the Degrees of Reading Power (DRP) 2018 Spring assessment. Resultantly, Bronx Green  will develop a year-long professional development plan that focuses on planning and implementing enrichment  and interventions opportunities (scaffolding) to advance student learning, specifically small group instruction.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Systems and Structures:   During content team meetings, teachers participate in the decision-making process around multiple assessment  measures to track student achievement and improve instruction (i.e. MoSL, i-ready, summative assessments, NYS  Exams). Additionally, during these meetings teachers receive content specific professional development regarding the  use of assessment results to drive and advance instruction. Specifically, teachers and staff engage in data dive  protocols to form instructional groups and modify units to meet the needs of their students.    Moreover, the MoSL Committee is comprised of teachers, the UFT Chapter Leader, and administrators to evaluate the  various assessment options. The committee jointly decides upon those assessments that best meets the needs of our  students and staff.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds.

IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school.

NewsELA develops nonfiction fluency and critical-thinking skills necessary to  master the Common Core standards for informational text. NewsELA publishes high-interest  news articles daily at five levels of complexity for grades 3-12 using NewsELA’s proprietary,  rapid text-leveling process. &nbsp;Each article has Common Core–aligned quizzes attached in  order to assess students reading strengths and weaknesses and create a plan based around the  data. In order to support ELL’s in math, students will use IXL, a technology based math  program. IXL provides individualized math practice with more than 1,000 skills and an  unlimited number or problems that include both multiple choice and fill-in-the blank questions to  ensure skill mastery. These programs tailor reading and math levels to individual student ability  and provide the students the opportunity to read material and practice math skills on their level  and then systematically increase their reading level, mathematical skills, and stamina in both  subjects. Furthermore, data from all three programs will be provided to all teachers of ELL  students in order to drive instruction both within as well as outside the classroom. &nbsp;The  core belief in using these programs at Bronx Green is that the students will be exposed to literacy  and mathematical skills at their level and then pushed further with more rigorous activities, in  turn increasing test scores.  ·  based on ELL level, IEPs, and SIFE label.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  At Bronx Green Middle School all ENL instruction is data driven through NYSESLAT modality analysis and Measures of Student  Learning Exams. In addition, Bronx Green uses iReady Adaptive Diagnostic Assessment, which is a reading and math  assessment and an instructional program that provides immediate, data on students' reading levels and math levels growth  over time.  Starting in the 2017 - 2018 school year, Bronx Green will administer the Degrees of Reading Power (DRP)  assessment as required by the Middle School Quality Initiative (MSQI). Data allows for the teachers of ELLs to differentiate  their instruction, make meaningful interventions when necessary, and track growth of each individual student. In addition, all  students are expected to complete an end of unit performance task as well as MoSL NYC BOY Performance Tasks in each  subject area. Lastly, Bronx Green has also invested in a a literacy based ENL program titled Imagine Learning: Language &  Literacy, which provides ELLs with  engaging and rigorous literacy activities and scaffolds in their native language. Our goal is to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         increase the number of ELLs reaching proficiency levels by 3% on the NYS ELA and Math exams every academic year.  All the  data provided by the various programs and assessments are analyzed on a regular basis by administration, all teachers, the  ENL Coordinator, and the parent coordinator. This information is used to further shape the pace and design of instruction for  ELA, ENL and all literacy-based approaches. All BGMS classrooms contain Lexile leveled libraries, genre libraries, word walls,  software tools, and other resources to help make content comprehensible for ELLs. In the classroom, the data is used to group  students for targeted small group instruction.  In addition, the data is used to plan for individual conferences and whole class  mini lessons. Furthermore, the data will help inform our instructional focus centered around component  3b: Using  Questioning and Discussion Techniques of the Danielson framework for teaching.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   In order to support the analysis of data and support teachers in using the data to drive instruction, teachers meet weekly in a  minimum of three team meetings: PLCs, content teams, and grade teams. In all meetings, protocols from the National School  Reform Faculty are used to enhance productivity and ensure the equitable sharing of best practices.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  At BGMS, ELL success is measured through a variety of formal and informal assessments, including, but not limited to MoSLs,  iReady Lexile Assessment, reading conferences, weekly quizzes and exams, progress reports, class work, homework, and  participation scores. Project-based learning is assessed through a system of rubrics and reflective evaluations that emphasize  higher-ordered metacognitive abilities. Basic Interpersonal Communicative Skills (BICS) and Cognitive Academic Language  Proficiency Skills (CALPS) are assessed on a daily basis during ENL pull-outs and small group instruction through conferencing  and oral assessment activities.  Starting Fall 2017, Bronx Green will administer the DRP to all students, including ELLs.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    After the data is analyzed, the school begins targeted instruction for all ENL students. Intervention plans include Saturday ENL  Academy and After school Intervention Services for ENL students who are not making significant gains on the NYSESLAT.   Additionally, weekly ENL teacher meetings allow the time to analyze data and plan instruction accordingly.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Teachers will be assigned ENL students to target for AIS during their professional periods.      6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   NYSESLAT and NYSITELL reports validate BGMS's focus on literacy building through project based learning that emphasizes  content-rich multi-modal instruction.  Students are taught explicit strategies to improve reading stamina and writing  volume.  Patterns reveal the challenge BGMS has to improve reading and writing levels across all grade levels.  The results of  the NYSITELL indicate the students' English proficiency level and help BGMS develop a plan for delivering ENL services and how  much intervention services students will need.  The data patterns revealed that many students who have been receiving  services for three years or less are making significant gains on the various modalities presented on the NYSESLAT.  We also  noticed that students who scored low on the Spanish LAB and the NYSITELL have scored significantly low on the reading  modality of the NYSESLAT.  These students are not fluent readers in their native language; therefore, have difficulty  transferring the skills from their L1 to their L2.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   In order to disseminate findings from various state assessments teachers meet weekly in a minimum of three team meetings:  PLCs, content teams, and grade teams. In all meetings, protocols from the National School Reform Faculty are used to enhance  productivity and ensure all voices are heard. Additionally, the ENL data is first analyzed by the LAP committee and then turn- keyed in a staff wide Professional Development at the start of the school year.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55           Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   In all grades, ELLS are serviced through an integrated ELA/ENL class with a certified ELA teacher and certified ENL  service provider. Student receive block ELA classes 8 periods a week are are grouped by grade only. All current ELLs  are programmed heterogeneously by grade level.  Additionally, the ENL provider will provide mandated stand-alone  classes in which students are grouped by performance levels as opposed to grade. Furthermore, two ENL service  providers push into content areas, such as Social Studies and Math, for further support.     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     Paste response to questions here:      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Paste response to questions here:         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Based on ELL status and IEP status, students receive ENL instruction in a push-in, pull-out, and integrated ELA and ENL  model.   Students in all grades that are identified as former ELLs as per CR Part 154.2  receive their mandated ENL minutes  through this model as well.  The pull-out ENL course focuses primarily on language acquisition and academic  vocabulary.  These students also receive their ELL services during ELA class which will be taught by both a certified ENL teacher  and a certified ELA teacher.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.    English Language Arts content instruction is delivered in general education classes for ELLs during their ELA periods. The  content includes using Code X and starting Fall 2017, the MSQI model along with external resources created by the teacher  based on the students' needs.  The content team teachers and the ENL teachers meet weekly to discuss units, lesson plans,  small group conferences, and plans for scaffolding differentiated instruction. Differentiated instruction and scaffolding of  resources is supported by ENL services and content team teachers.  All are well-versed in differentiation strategies for  language learners. Content is enriched through the use of socially constructed project-based learning activities, capable of  addressing variations in learning styles and modalities through a variety of SIOP and CALLA-based strategies. For the ENL pull- out classes, the certified ENL teacher uses the Academic Vocabulary Toolkit created and provided by the Department of  English Language Learners along with units created by American Institute for Research provided by the Office of ELLs.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   ELLs at Bronx Green are periodically assessed in their home languages throughout the school year through the use of various  language assessments including grammar and reading comprehension quizzes found online or teacher-created based on the  content presented in class. Additionally, students are assessed in the Native language through the program Imagine Learning.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   a.   SIFE     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a. SIFE - Bronx Green ENL providers implement ENL strategies for SIFE students primarily through targeted small group  instruction during scheduled ENL pull-outs. During this time, ENL providers and content team teachers work with SIFE students  individually and in small groups to bridge gaps in their skill base using a variety of Q-Tel-derived differentiation strategies and  Wilson phonics skill building exercises.  b. Newcomer - Instruction focuses on developing the literacy skills in the native  language.  Instruction is consistent with New York State and New York City performance guidelines and standards.  In the push- in and pull-out periods, the following supplementary materials will support ENL instruction: native language books through  capstones digital library, quality high-interest, lower reading level, age appropriate books, flash cards, graphic organizers,  picture dictionaries, computer lab and iPads. Additionally, ELLs are given specific focus in developing literacy skills through  extended day programs and Saturday Academy in order to better prepare them for the NYS ELA and Math exams.  c.  Developing - In addition to mandated minutes, ELLs within the 4 - 6 year window receive additional tutoring in the form of  AIS  sessions during the regular school day and in-class conferencing with content area teachers and ENL providers. In addition to  the supplements mentioned above, ELA Teachers of ELLs  who fall within the 4 - 6 years window will follow the MSQI model to  increase reading comprehension across content areas.  Lastly, Diagnostic assessments are used to target specific modalities  and skill gaps that students will focus on during class and homework assignments.  d. Long Term - LTEs receive additional  instruction during the regular school day in the form of AIS, Saturday Academy, and extended-day programs with the  assistance of both content and ENL providers. Special efforts are made to assist long-term ELLs with comprehension strategies,  based on Q-Tel derived strategies.  e. Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status - Former ELLs will receive their  mandated ELL services from an ENL service provider during their ELA class through a push-in model.  Students are provided  with the extended time for all formal and informal assessments for two years after they gain proficiency on the NYSESLAT as  well as a native language/English glossary. Students are provided additional support in all their classrooms via technology such  as iPad dictionary and thesaurus applications when an ENL service provider is not scheduled to service the student.        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?    In order to provide access to academic content areas and accelerate English language development the ESL teachers and  content team teachers will use the following programs and strategies with ELL-SwDs:  iReady Diagnostic Adaptive Assessment  to track and assess students' lexile gains, and provides targeted lessons based on students' strengths andweaknesses. Wilson  strategies are implemented in small group instruction. Furthermore, CodeX is used during ELA and Connected MathP3 is used  during Math, both provided by NYCDOE. Students also use the Academic Vocabulary Toolkit to further accelerate English  language development.  The school ensures ELL-SWDs receive all services mandated on their IEPs through the use of SESIS  printouts.  The program provides an overview of all the services required.  The printouts are stored in a binder and updated  monthly. The students' schedules reflect all the related services mandated through their IEP, which can be located on STARS  CLASSROOM. Lessons in all classes are modified as per the students' academic, social, emotional, and management needs;  according to the Present Levels of Performance specified on the students Individual Education plan.  Lastly, the Language  Access Coordinator meets monthly with the School Implementation Team to guarentee that ELL-SWDs are receiving their  mandates as per their IEP.  This includes ensuring all students requiring a blingual paraprofessional or bilingual instruction  receives it.  Since Bronx Green does not offer bilingual instruction, both the S.I.T. team and the L.A.C. work together to find a  school that offers the appropriate setting for the student.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  During the students IEP meeting, the Special Education team along with the Language Access Coordinator determines the least  restrictive environment using i-Ready, academic, social, and physical function assessment determined by all parties involved in  the IEP meeting. Then, based upon the results of the IEP meeting, students are placed in the least restrictive environment  which may include a self-contained class, integrated team teaching class, or general education class with special education   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      teacher support services.  After the student is placed, the IEP teachers review the students Measurable Annual Goals quarterly.  If changes need to be made, the Special Education team meets, discusses, and rectifies the issue.        8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  The targeted intervention strategies used to  to assist struggling ELLs, SIFE students, and newcomers include one-to-one  tutoring opportunities before school, at lunch, extended day, and Saturday Academy. Content team teachers and ENL service  providers are available after school and during Saturday Academy to assist students with skill building activities and specific  comprehension concerns. Additionally, in ELA, math, social Studies, and science students are offered intervention services  based on their data from i-Ready and Imagine Learning in both reading in math.  Students are grouped according their lexile  level in ELA and social studies and instruction is differentiated for each group.  For example, the lowest group of ELLs receive  native language translations of all their work along with the ability to use the iPads for extra support.  The mid level group  receives sentence starters and small group instruction focused on language acquisition.  The highest group receives support  through one-on-one conferences in which the teacher and student create an academic plan based on students strengths and  weaknesses. For Math and Science, teachers use the i-Ready math data to group their students by levels.  Just as in ELA and  Social Studies, students receive differentiated work depending on their levels.  This includes targeting instruction for students’  weaknesses and building upon their strengths.         9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      For the upcoming school year the administrative team has purchased the program Imagine Learning for ENL students and has  joined MSQI with the goal of moving our LTEs to commanding on the NYSESLAT. Based on the latest NYSESLAT data, the LTEs  at BGMS did not show gains in the reading and writing domains; therefore, we believe with these supplemental resources,  teachers are able to target the specific needs of this population.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   Currently, there have not been any ELL programs/services discontinued because the school has determined all programs to be  effective.        11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are invited to participate in all after school activities such as Bronx House, including ENL related tutoring.  ENL related  tutoring includes an ELL after school program, Saturday Academy and Tech for ELLs.  Invitations go out to all students in the  form of permission slips.  Currently the entirety of the BGMS ELL population attend extended-day programs.  Funding for after  school programs and Saturday Academy comes from Bronx House and Title III.       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  BGMS teachers strive to create lessons that address all learning modalities through the use of software technology, visual aids,  audio and video materials, kinesthetic activities, and relevant field trips. ENL materials include newcomer text books and work  books, bilingual libraries, dictionaries, and glossaries, language manipulatives, instructional games, graphic novels, and flash  cards, classroom sets of iPads, classroom sets of Mac Air books, Capstone Library, i-Ready, & Imagine Learning.  Each ELL  student has access to an iPad Mini and a Mac Air on a regular basis to assist in translations or to use during class to help gain a  better understanding of the presented material.  Moreover, each ELL classroom has a Smart TV installed in order to allow  teachers to present each lesson using both visual aids and audio materials.  Students use the iPads in each class as native  language support systems such a bilingual dictionaries, google translations, etc.  ENL and content team teachers regularly  attend DoE, in house, and Department of ELLs-sponsored professional development seminars to remain up to date on the  latest strategies and most effective techniques for delivering differentiated, project-based instruction. In addition, the  members of the ENL staff design and facilitate three annual ENL professional development workshops as per the CR Part  154.2. A minimum of 15% of all professional development will be focused on ENL strategies     13.

Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Required services and support correspond to ELLs' ages and grade levels. Students are provided age appropriate books and  study materials.  Small group conferencing is used to address individual student needs.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    The needs of all ELLs are met academically, linguistically, and socio-emotionally regardless of our shared space. All three  schools located at the M.S. 135 Campus work together during state testing to ensure that the ELL's are provided with a  translator in their native language. The schools within the M.S. 135 Campus work together to plan testing of ELLs, grading of  NYSESLAT, MoSL, as well as other ELL related issues.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Newly-arrived ELLs are assisted Bronx Green’s Parent Coordinator, the guidance counselor, the Dean, and the ENL Coordinator  before the beginning of the school year. Students and families are connected to community-based support organizations, local  and State assistance programs, as well as advocacy organizations, based on need. The parent coordinator maintains an active  relationship with local groups to ensure that newly-arrived students and families will receive the level of support they deserve  during the newcomer process. Newly enrolled ELLs are invited to attend Saturday ELL Academy, Saturday ELL Technology  Academy, after school ESL enrichment program, as well as programs offered through Bronx House.  New arrivals are also  paired up with a student in their class that speaks the same language to help them get acquainted and assimilated to the  school.  On the first day the student begins class, he/she is introduced to the school through an orientation presented by both  the ENL Coordinator as well as the student assigned to help the newcomer assimilate.        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    At Bronx Green all ELLs are treated equally and receive electives including Technology, Field Study, Art, College Access for All,  and Ballroom Dancing.       18.

At the start of the school year, these teachers will turn key all the Professional  Development workshops to the staff. Lastly, all PDs support teachers in delivering Common-Core aligned instruction.  Each PD  focuses on a few standards for each content area and how each teacher can differentiate the work in order to make content  accessible for our diverse learners while still aligning all tasks to the common core standards. For the 2017-2018 school year,  staff will receive a minimum of 10 hours in PD sessions to help content teachers with strategies for ELLs. Staff will attend off- site work shops in differentiation, SIFE students, and scaffolding strategies. Some examples include Math Concepts for ELLs,  Supporting ELL parents outside the classroom, etc.  Attendance logs will be collected and teachers that receive training will be  expected to turn-key PD to their colleagues.        2.

Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   The ENL Coordinator schedules individual meetings with parents in conjunction with the Parent Coordinator and a translator is  present, if necessary.  These meetings occur twice a year, usually at the start of the school year and during Parent Teacher   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60            Conferences, and entail setting language goals for the individual students and tracking the goal, discussing how the students  language is developing, as well and all assessment results of the student.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Bronx Green Middle School                                                                              School DBN: 11X326  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
