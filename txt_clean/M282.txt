This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Section 4: CEP Overview      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      Mission    The Urban Assembly Maker Academy (UA Maker), a school of the Urban Assembly, believes the world needs problem  solvers who can find and solve challenges to create positive change in a world where change is the only constant. We  empower students to be successful, adaptive citizens of the future, who will create the future through design thinking  and innovation. Our students are curious about the world around them and empathize with others to develop  personalized solutions. Our students know that to innovate, they must take risks. They measure the impact of their  actions. They overcome challenges with resilience.   Vision    Our students will be prepared to enter the post-secondary option of their choice. They will be prepared to enter  college or enter the work force with a working knowledge of technology, a clear sense of their strengths and  weaknesses, and growth and design thinking mindsets, which will ensure they are resilient in pursuit of success.   Core Values    Curiosity : Our school community constantly asks “why.” We are on the look out to improve our world. In order to  always be forward thinking, we develop our curiosity, creativity, and confidence to push boundaries.    Empathy : We understand that we all bring unique and diverse experiences to our community. We work to ensure  those experiences are heard and honored. We assume positive intentions of others as we work together to build our  community.   Risk-taking: We know that to reach new levels of success and to develop new, creative ideas and solutions to  problems, we must venture beyond what feels comfortable to us. When we take risks, we have the opportunity to  revise and reflect on our actions and push ourselves to new levels of thinking.    Self-Awareness: We measure the effectiveness of our actions. We know ourselves and use that knowledge to ask for  support when we need it. We use our understanding of our strengths and weaknesses to create plans of action to  achieve our goals.   Resilience: We learn from our challenges and mistakes, and use them to better position ourselves for success in the  future         2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    Strategic Partnerships   1. SpringPoint: Partners in School Design:      Relationship: Carnegie Corporation of New York created Springpoint to provide consultancy and guidance to all  recipients of Carnegie funds to implement the 10 Carnegie Design Principles in vetted new innovative high schools  around the country. These principles will inform a curriculum, culture and practice that effectively meet the demands  of the Common Core. The Urban Assembly Maker Academy project is called Opportunity by Design.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Prior to UA Maker’s opening, Springpoint supported the four-phase design process: Prepare, Research & Frame,  Design & Build, Launch. Our Carnegie Design Fellow continues to serve as the point person for Springpoint  communication during our opening year, and the 2 or 3-year iterative improvement process following.    Springpoint has view access to UA Maker’s Google Drive and monitors the progress of our work. All outcomes and  summative reporting goes through our Design Fellow but “low-lift” blog entries or questions can be shared by all on  Jive (information sharing platform).   Current Springpoint partners: Cleveland School District, Denver Public Schools, NYC DOE, The School District of  Philadelphia, (The Urban Assembly).       2. Parsons The New School      Relationship: Parsons is UA Maker’s primary post-secondary partner. As thought-partners and information sharers,  Parsons has opened their graduate classrooms and expertise to UA Maker’s design, viewing UA Maker as an  opportunity for their students to engage in real-world implementation of design-thinking. They have essentially taken  the creation of UA Maker on as part of their curriculum: UA Maker benefits from expertise/ideas generated and grad  students benefit from effecting and engaging in an actual design problem, potentially seeing their ideas in action.   Graduate students created unit plans aligned with the design process, inclusive of hands-on projects UA Maker  teachers in non-Career and Technical High School (CTE) disciplines could use to diversify the concept of “Maker.”  Professors have suggested his students could design a widget or extension for our Learning Management System,  Canvas, which would alleviate its shortcomings in incorporating data from external systems, automatically populate  lesson plans or create a visual of student progress.   Additionally, Parsons is helping narrow down industry standards and language regarding Maker jobs, for the CTE  approval process. Parsons also works with our team to incorporate the Growth Mindset rubric into student  evaluation. Lastly, they have offered to share their blueprint for a Maker space with UA Maker (for our own  inspiration).       Possible plugins:   ● CTE Advisory Board membership   ● Workshops for students at Parsons   ● “Day in the Life” of an industry student/ college visits   ● Student visits/use of Parsons Maker space   ● Capstone project advisor/judge   ● Preferential admission to college   3.

Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   A large percentage of our students arrive reading and scoring in math multiple grades below where they should be.  Through administering the Degrees of Reading Power exam to students in September of 2018 we learned that in  grades 9-12 we had 50%, 66%, 46%, and 49% of students reading Well Below Grade Level respectively 9-12. Our  students in special education represent about 14% of our student body. Our English Language Learner population is  remaining steady at about 4%. Our design theme also attracts a large percentage of students interested in art and  design and computer science, our CTE pathways. Our class of 2019 has an anticipated 85% graduation rate as of  January 2019. We are working extremely hard to increase this number and have devoted a CEP goal to it, because this  group had an anticipated 70% graduation rate 18 months ago.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The element of the Framework for Great Schools that we made the most progress on last year was Collaborative  Teachers. This goal was about credit accrual and moving from 81% to 85%. As of June 2018 we have an 89% overall  pass rate for the 2017-18 school year. We are expanding this work in 2018-2019 by focusing in on our class of 2019  who are currently anticipated to have a 75% graduation rate. This group of students increased their overall pass rate  from 2016-17 to 2017-18 by 5% from 86% to 91%. We want to continue this work and the work around passing the  five required regents on time during the upcoming school year. We believe that tying the work of our inquiry teams to  our CEP goals will lead to increased ownership by more teachers. Also increasing the amount of consistency that  students experience from one classroom to the next is going to be the focus of our Consistent Procedures and  Routines (CPR) team. This group includes members from each of our inquiry (subject area) teams and will be charged   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12      with supporting teachers in their teams with embedding common procedures and routines throughout their classes. It  is our theory of action that the clearer we make the criteria for success in a classroom, the higher engagement and  achievement our students will enjoy.       The element we want to focus on this year is Rigorous Instruction. We have set a goal around increasing the  percentage of students scoring at the College and Career Ready (CCR) level on the ELA and Math regents exams. This  aligns to our District Wide Goal as well of increasing our Affinity average college readiness by 2%. At Maker Academy  we set a goal of increasing our ELA college readiness by 5% from 43% to 48% and our Math by 5% from 51% to 56%.  As of January 2019, we have 64% of our senior class CCR in math and 59% in ELA. Getting all students to read on grade  level is a key to providing equity and access to our project based curriculum. In order to get students reading on grade  level we need to use an accurate assessment to monitor our progress while embedding literacy practices in all  classrooms. At Maker Academy we have developed Power Standards in Math and ELA that we believe are key  practices needed to be college ready. We use our inquiry teams to develop performance tasks and benchmarks that  help us to assess student mastery of our power standards. We believe that by June 2019 if we have power standards  and performance tasks aligned to them, and use common instructional practices that allow students the opportunity  to practice the power standards, then students' college readiness scores will increase. Our inquiry teams use inter- visitations of each others' classrooms to support this work.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 02M282   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   386   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     We have identified Literacy and Math as a focus within all units of instruction at UA Maker, based on our lower  numbers of students scoring at the College and Career Ready Level on the Regents Exams. Historically, about 70% of  incoming students at Maker Academy arrive reading below grade level. Teachers have been asked to include close  reading of texts into their units of study. During the 2014-2015 school year we had an average increase of 3.8 level  which is almost a 2 year growth. During the 2015-2016 school year we had an average increase of 4.2 and 6.2 for 9th  and 10th grade respectively. Success in high school academic courses requires that students be reading on grade level  so they can engage in tasks that require critical thinking, analysis of rich texts, and creating clear models and claims.  This is difficult work but through the help of Odell Education and reDesign we have built a sequence of college-ready  performance tasks from 9-12 that help assess whether students are on grade-level in their reading and math. We  have identified that being on grade level in reading and math while completing a rich sequence of performance tasks  is a key to rigorous coursework and instruction at Maker Academy.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible  for implementation and oversight.  We begin working with families in June before the school year even begins by hosting Accepted Students Night. The  Principal speaks to parents about the importance of attendance and reading. Students are expected to read every day  the summer before arriving at Maker Academy. We also ask that parents understand the need for a dedicated place  for students to complete homework each evening. Additionally, we speak about the importance of attendance each  school day. If students attendance drops below 95% they are considered at risk. Below 90% and they are chronically  absent.    Through the use of Kinvolved, an attendance and messaging platform, parents will receive automatic attendance  alerts. Our parent coordinator and teachers will use Kinvolved to communicate with parents around upcoming events,  assignments, and student progress. All parents also have access to their students’ grades through JumpRope, an  online mastery based grading platform. This allows parents to view students’ progress on mastering specific skills in  each course along with missing and upcoming work. We will do workshops with families on accessing and  understanding JumpRope.   At Back to School Night, September 26, 2018, parents were given a workshop on how to access Google Classroom and  Jumprope. We then speak to parents about mastery-based grading and how this increases rigor for students because  they get feedback on their proficiency of specific Common Core and Next Generation Science Standards.    Our leadership team, teachers, and students all participate in the education process for families of students.  Specifically, we do workshops with families to support their understanding of what grade level reading, writing and  math looks like. We ask for parent feedback on the language of our rubrics to identify if they are understandable in a  way that parents can support their children.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  Building a strong school culture is paramount for a school early in its development. Part of a strong school culture is  attendance. We had a 90.9% attendance in 2014-15 but dropped over 3% in 2015-16. We increased our attendance in  2016-17, moving up 2% to 89% and are sitting at 89% for 2017-18. This past year we changed our goal to looking at  the percent of students at 90% attendance or higher. At the end of 2016-17 we had 69% of students at 90% or higher.  At the end of 2017-18 we had 68% of students at 90% or higher. Moving into our 5th year we want to keep our focus  on this specific targeted group of students. By working collaboratively with our attendance team, we identified the  group of students at our school that are chronically absent, 80-90% overall. These students are present often enough  to focus our energy on supporting. We believe that if we target this group of students are present enough but still  consistently missing 1 day every 2 weeks, we can make a large difference. These students are students that are not  passing regents on their first attempt. We believe that strong student attendance can make a large difference in first  time regents passage.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  By June, 2019, we will effectively engage with families around the impact of attendance on student achievement, and  will build students' sense of ownership for their leaning, as evidenced by a 5% increase in the number of students with  90% and above attendance, from 68% to 73%.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          20     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

During the 2017-2018 school year we modified our structure for professional development. Modeled off the Urban  Assembly Inc.'s Principal Instructional Rounds model, UA Maker engaged teachers in cycles of inquiry that included  visiting each others' classrooms to learn from each others' practices. Through this work we have built the structures  for whole school and subject area professional development. We used a PROSE vote to modify our schedule to use an  early release on Wednesday next year to allow these inquiry teams to meet. This work led us to a 4.13 score on the  Quality of Professional Development score on the Learning Environment Survey, which is 15% higher than the  Borough Average.   For 2018-19 we want to deepen this work by creating an shared Problem of Practice, Theory of Action and  Instructional Focus. We began this work in June 2018. Our 2018-19 POP, TOA, and IF:   Problem of Practice:    At Maker Academy we believe that people learn by working together. During 2017-18 we used inquiry teams as our  primary driver of adult learning. We learned that adults effectively collaborating toward a shared goal can be an  effective way for a school to learn. For 2018-19 we will deepen this work by shifting to subject-area inquiry teams  that focus on shared instructional practices. Therefore out 18-19 POP:      Problem of Practice: How do we improve and make consistent our high quality mastery-based practices around  feedback so that students will be able to make progress in academics and behavior.   ↓   Theory of Action: If we consistently implement high quality mastery-based practices around feedback, then  students will be able to make progress in academics and behavior.   ↓   Instructional Focus: Students will engage in mastery-based practices around feedback in order to make progress in  academics and behavior.    Teachers engage students in this by:     Clearly articulating what mastery of a standard looks and sounds like.    Providing opportunities for students to understand and practice standards.     Providing both in the moment and summative feedback.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          23     Demonstrating student learning and reflection on rigorous Performance Tasks through Wordpress blogs.

We continue to find new way to engage parents in our school. Our biggest successes during 2017-2018 were  purchasing Kinvolved which allows us to communicate via email and text messaging in each family's native or home  language. We also worked hard to create a functioning PA meeting every month. Our co-presidents were successful in  increasing attendance at each meeting by over 100% from an average of 10 families to over 20 families each month.  By distributing this leadership out we have increased buy-in from parents. Our scores on the Learning Environment  Survey continue to show high scores in Trust, Strong Family Community Ties, and Strong School Leadership,  outscoring the Borough and City Average. By increasing the number of opportunities for parents to engage with  teachers through both student led conferences and traditional conferences, we hope to create stronger relationships  with parents. Additionally, through our use of advisory, we hope that academic progress can better be communicated  to parents regularly throughout the year.       Our work for 2018-19 continues to be around engaging families in the success of their students. We want to develop a  better tracking system for knowing how many families have "engaged" with the school. Engagement, as we have  defined it means either attending a conference, parent meeting, social event, or participating in a phone conference  with the school. We are developing simple tracking system and working with our new parent coordinator to  implement a system to quickly track this information.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  Being a new school we have already started our recruiting efforts for the 2018-2019 school year. We actively recruit  on social media and through our personal networks. All prospective teachers are given a curriculum planning  performance task which we use to help screen candidates. Screening interviews are then conducted followed by  demo lessons and group interviews with current teachers and staff members. Final interviews with the principal are  then conducted. This five step process helps us recruit highly qualified staff.      After hiring new staff, each teacher meets individually with APS to for on-boarding with our school mission and  initiatives and to support in planning their first project-based unit. During the year, APS meet weekly with each  teacher for 1:1 meetings to create and monitor progress on individual teacher goals and provide support in  implementing school-wide initiatives. Teacher-led inquiry teams provide teachers with opportunities for leadership  and collaboration.   Additionally, we work closely with our network HR Liaison to ensure that all candidates moving through our  recruitment process are also actively making sure they are fully certified to teach in New York City and New York  State.        2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   Throughout the year, students will regularly engage in a range of tasks and activities that support their ability to  eventually participate in solving carefully selected and designed problems that demand from them the acquisition of  critical knowledge, problem solving proficiency, self-directed learning strategies and team participation skills.   A host of strategies, skills, structures and practices can be introduced to teachers so they can work towards providing  problem based experiences for students. Making a decision as to what practices to focus a staff-wide study and design  process will ultimately be decided upon by the skill set and needs of the teachers being hired, as well as, a   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      collaborative process involving teachers and leadership. In addition, student needs will also be strategically  considered in order to determine which specific practices to focus our professional development effort for teachers.      For the 2018-2019 year our professional development is framed around our Problem of Practice:   Problem of Practice: How do we improve and make consistent our high quality mastery-based practices around  feedback so that students will be able to make progress in academics and behavior.

N/A        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.        Each year we engage our teachers in the decision making process for determining which MOSLs to administer at our  school. With a dedicated focus on literacy at UA Maker, we unequivocally believe in all teachers using the ELA MOSL  as their local measure. The ability to read non-fiction texts, annotate for key ideas, and write strong evidenced-based  claims is a key skill in all subject areas that we believe is essential. We also do training during the summer months on  the DRP exams which we use as baseline and formative assessments. Teachers learn how to drive their instruction  from these exams      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)     1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39        A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. The Urban Assembly Maker Academy, in compliance with the Section 1118 of  Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent  involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the  families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision- making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School  Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of  the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   The Urban Assembly Maker Academy will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology including school provided email;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator to serve as a liaison between the school and families. The Parent Coordinator will  provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will  work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also  maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Teachers utilize a variety of formative and embedded assessments. Largely, these are teacher-created, and include tasks that  are aligned to our schoolwide standards. These standards are used to measure progress toward mastery in both  language/literacy skills as well as content knowledge. Typical formative assessments include quizzes, tests, writing tasks (both  short answer and essay), and oral presentations. Additionally, each of our units culminates in a multi-modal integrative  performance task project that is used to drive instruction for ELLs; common projects include infographics, lab reports,  presentations, videos, and portfolios. In preparation for these, students complete components of their final product  throughout the unit via embedded and scaffolded mini-tasks that build toward their larger project. This curriculum design  provides teachers with the opportunity to evaluate student understanding and progress in a variety of ways and at multiple  points throughout the unit, which in turn creates many opportunities to both give specific feedback and modify instruction to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49      ensure that content and language is delivered within the students' zone of proximal development. The ELL periodic  assessment expressive language rubrics are also utilized to formatively assess ELL spoken and written language development  within content classrooms; these guide instructional design and strengthen the co-teaching relationship between content and  ENL teachers.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   One structure that supports instructional design that incorporates and responds to formative assessment is professional  development. During the summer and on designated PD days, the instructional staff works with reDesign to construct project- based units with embedded formative assessment and opportunities for iteration. Instructional design consultants support  staff in ensuring that they are clearly and consistently linking assessment to both instruction and target outcomes in specific  and measurable ways. Additionally, the ENL teacher leads whole-school PD  to provide strategies to integrate ELL-specific  assessment and scaffolding; she also meets with teachers on an individual basis to support responsiveness and adaptation to  student-specific needs that are reflected in assessment data.  Teachers also have the opportunity to develop instructional  design features and practices in ongoing department meetings with a shared instructional focus. In these meetings, team  members share data on students and plan assessments and interventions that take this information into account.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The Degrees of Reading Power (DRP) and NWEA Measures of Academic Progress (MAP) assessments are administered at the  beginning and end of the year in order to identify baseline literacy measures and areas of student need and annual/YOY  progress relative to these baseline measures. The NWEA MAP is also used to evaluate students' strengths, needs, and growth  in math abilities at the beginning and end of the year.  The NYC ELA performance task is administered at the end of the year to  measure students' overall reading and writing skills; EOY results are compared to prior years' data to evaluate the impact of  instructional moves and plan for more successful design in the future.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Department meetings are also used to address appropriate interventions following the collection of summative data-- team  members collaborate to redesign instruction, differentiating process, product, and scaffolding as needed to provide  appropriate support and opportunities for learning. Department teams and targeted inquiry teams also conduct  intervisitations to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions following summative assessment and provide feedback to  teachers with respect to instructional practices and next steps. Interventions for ELLs are also supported by ENL and special  education teachers through individual consultations, collaborative curriculum and intervention design, and instructional  strategy modeling. On a larger scale, the ENL and special education team collaborates with the school programmer and  administration in order to build in as much flexibility in student scheduling as possible to allow for ongoing responsive support.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   n/a     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Our programmer uses the NYSESLAT as the primary ELL scheduling metric; students are assigned to courses with varying levels  of ENL support depending upon their demonstrated proficiency. Additionally, Regents (ELA, Algebra I, Geometry, Earth  Science, US History, Global Studies, Living Environment) scores are used to identify areas where ELL students might benefit  from additional support via scaffolding, differentiating, additional test prep, and/or co-teaching.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Findings from outcome assessments are disseminated in a variety of ways. Department meetings are used to conduct item  analyses of test results in content areas; this data is used to drive instructional design and curriculum/strategy modification for  future content delivery. Additionally, end of year test results are shared and analyzed at the beginning of year professional  development sessions. The ENL teacher also creates an ELL profile document that specifies ELL proficiency and particular   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50         learning needs is shared with all of staff; she individually checks in with teachers of each ELL to debrief/plan next steps as well,  and  coordinates with the school programmer to make scheduling decisions that are responsive to both language and content  needs for the following year.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Students are serviced primarily through Integrated ENL, per the new Part 154 guidelines. A licensed ENL teacher  pushes into the classroom and co-teaches using parallel instruction, small group work, or individual conferencing and  differentiation that supports the day's content objectives with language development and facilitates student access to  grade level curriculum and CCLS. Pull-out groups are also incorporated on a case-by-case basis, depending on student  proficiency levels and specific needs. Classes rotate on a block schedule, and ELLs are heterogeneously distributed  among classrooms. Integrated ENL is provided during the ELA block for each class on a respective grade. Students are  pulled into small groups homogeneously or heterogeneously within their class depending on the day's activity and  language objectives. Stand-Alone ENL is implemented in designated elective/study hall periods and supplemented  with pull-out check-ins and support as needed. Additional Stand-Alone ENL is implemented as needed for support  around particular language/content objectives; these groups are usually heterogeneous with respect to proficiency  level and the overall composition is dictated by the skill that is being taught or supplemented. Students at the  Entering, Emerging, and Transitioning levels receive stand-alone ENL in addition to the integrated ENL that is  mandated for Expanding and Commanding students.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     n/a   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      n/a      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Standalone minutes are delivered primarily during the elective periods built into our schedule on Mondays and Tuesdays (120  minutes of instruction). "Entering" proficiency students who require 180 minutes will be programmed for one additional  period of standalone ENL in their schedule to account for the entire mandate.    Integrated ENL instruction will be delivered in ELA, Social Studies, and Science classes. The primary ENL teacher, Katie Moylan,  is completing her social studies license and will deliver integrated instruction in US History, Government, and AP Human  Geography courses. Ms. Moylan will also co-teach ELA classes as needed to support Entering and Emerging students in  meeting their mandates with respect to ENL/ELA integrated instruction. Additionally, Maker will have a dual-licensed  ENL/science teacher (Heidi Crockett) who will also provide integrated instruction in her chemistry classes and in  supplementary science support classes.     3.

Content is made comprehensible using ENL scaffolding  methodology and differentiation strategies such as dual language materials, visuals, use of cognates, dictionaries, glossaries  and periodic checks for understanding. Students are also allowed to respond in developmentally appropriate ways that take  advantage of their linguistic strengths; for example, students may dictate a paper using Dragon speech to text software, rather  than write a first draft, then use revision processes to strengthen their draft and practice developing academic writing abilities  and strategies. These strategies are intended to allow ELLs to access the grade-level content standards prescribed by the CCLS;  students are held to the same content expectations with varying degrees of language acquisition support. The ENL teacher,  Katie Moylan, supplements English language instruction during integrated co-teaching and standalone ENL with Spanish oral  and written translation as needed. Students are encouraged and supported to respond in their L1/HL as appropriate. Ms.  Moylan collaborates with each of the content area teachers (Physics, Living Environment, Algebra I, Global Studies, US History,  ELA, Geometry, Earth Science) to develop materials that are developmentally appropriate for each proficiency level, per the  Bilingual/ENL CCLS and the proficiency guidelines developed by WIDA and TESOL. Ms. Moylan also works with teachers to use  strategies from the SIOP and CALLA instructional approaches to make content comprehensible for all ELLs. Instructional  outcomes in the ELA classrooms are aligned to the proficiency-specific expectations outlined by the NYS Bilingual/ENL CCLS  progression. In History and Science classrooms that borrow standards from the ELA CCLS, the Bilingual/ENL CCLS progression  also dictates the criteria for success for ELLs. Ms. Moylan also supports student work in the content areas during one-to-one  intervention and conferencing during our study hall/elective period-- this gives her the opportunity to check in with students,  assess their progress and needs in the content classes, and develop appropriate scaffolds to support success in the  assignments they are completing.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   Content instruction is delivered in English with home language support. Students are encouraged to use their home language  when needed and/or desired, and they are evaluated using the ACTFL Global Language Standards in conjunction with the NYS  Bilingual CC Progression. This evaluation is facilitated through the use of in-house translators, translation services, and  translation programs. Students are provided with explicit instruction and support with respect to the use of home language  resources, including subject-specific glossaries and translation technology.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Instruction is designed to be adaptive for the individual strengths, needs, and development of each ELL.  Scaffolds are provided  as needed to develop competencies to insure success at grade level standards.    The differentiated instructional plan for SIFE students includes a focus on prosocial skills, evaluation of educational  background, and the provision of scaffolds and home language support to facilitate connection to prior knowledge and  linguistic assets. In addition, teachers modify assignments to give students access to content at their current literacy level with  some expectation to produce, replicate and apply information orally and in writing, with a focus on the development of both  BICS and CALP.    The differentiated instructional plan for Newcomers (under 3 years) continues to emphasize prosocial skills, provide scaffolds  to background knowledge, and modify instruction to include more comprehensible input with the expectation to fully  produce, replicate and apply information orally and in writing. The shift in instructional focus changes from BICS to CALP.    The differentiated instructional plan for ELLs receiving 4-6 years of service and long term ELLs is to provide instruction focused  on CALP in order to provide increased opportunities for academic success and performance at or above grade level. Scaffolding  methods are used to individualize instruction to support growth in areas of developing proficiency and provide multiple levels  of instruction and opportunities for achievement that are adaptive and responsive to evolving student skill sets.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52        The differentiated instructional plan for Former ELLs involves continued and frequent monitoring by all content area teachers  and supplemental support services (with ESL teacher) to ensure continued academic growth. Former ELLs receive one half unit  of service (90 minutes) for two years after testing at “Commanding” on the NYSESLAT. The following testing accomodations for  ELLs are also honored for Former ELLs for 2 years after achieving proficiency on NYSESLAT:  -- Time Extension (all exams): Principals, in conversation with a student’s classroom teacher, can use reasonable judgment in  giving extended time on NYS ELA, content-area exams, and on Regents. There are no time limits imposed on ELLs with this  accommodation. Schools may extend the test time for ELL students on NYS ELA and content-area assessments and on Regents  examinations.        -- Separate location (all exams): ELLs may take NYS assessments individually or in small groups in a separate location.          -- Third reading of listening selection (English Language Arts exams only): ELLs may request a third reading of the listening  passage on the Regents Comprehensive English Exam (grade 3-8 accommodation does not apply to HS students).  -- Bilingual dictionaries and/or glossaries (all tests except LOTE): ELLs may use bilingual glossaries/dictionaries that provide  only direct one-to-one translations of words.  -- Simultaneous use of English and alternative language editions (all translated SED exams except ELA): ELLs may use both  English and an alternative language edition of the test simultaneously but should record any written responses in only one  language.  -- Oral translations for low incidence languages (all exams except ELA): ELL students may be provided with an oral (not written)  translation of a state examination when there is no translated edition provided by SED.  -- Writing responses in the home language (all exams except ELA): On alternate language/orally translated exams, ELLs may  respond in writing in their home language.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Grade level materials that are commonly used for ELL-SWDs to provide academic content and accelerated English  development are multi-leveled readers to give access to content and increase vocabulary development. ELL-SWDs are  provided with the same grade-level texts that their peers use in class, with supplementary scaffolding like text adaptation,  graphic organizers for note-taking, and audio recordings of texts. Additionally, interactive educational applications are used to  teach grammar, fluency and increase vocabulary. Examples of the technology used are LightSail for ELA to provide reading  support by Lexile levels, Fluency Tutor for accelerated English and fluency development; additionally many teachers use the  Smart board for visualization of content. Students receive materials in their native language (or the option to translate  materials using an iPad) upon request, and all students have access to native language dictionary resources. Students whose  IEPs mandate bilingual related services (speech, counseling, etc) receive those in their native language whenever possible. In  order to ensure that ELL-SWDs receive all IEP-mandated services, in addition to ENL support, the ENL teacher, Katie Moylan,  collaborates with the special education teachers (Jared Russo, Morgan Riley, Jason Feldman) around instructional planning.  Ms. Moylan co-teaches in the ICT classrooms as needed per student IEP mandates, which satisfies both the IEP and ENL  mandates for two of our ELL-SWDs. ELLs with disabilities are not exempted from the NYSESLAT, and use the test modifications  and accommodations as detailed on their IEP when taking the NYSESLAT. ELL status does not determine special education  eligibility. Response to Intervention (RTI) approaches are applied to ELL students who enter with lower levels of proficiency in  the home language, or if anticipated progress is not noted after a reasonable time period.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  ENL teachers are part of the IEP team for their students and collaborate with service providers to coordinate related  instruction and goals. They are involved at each step, from initial identification to summative year-end progress checks to  subsequent re-evaluations. Additionally, the ENL teacher regularly checks in with the Special Education team to share  information about students, learn more about individual student needs, and seek advice about integrating special education  supports with ENL instruction. ENL teachers are aware of and responsible for student IEP goal progress and, whenever  possible, work alongside ICT special educators to develop lesson plans that support this development.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Integrated ENL instruction is provided primarily in ELA and Social Studies and takes place in Math and Science on an as-needed  basis. All content areas are taught primarily in English and supported by ENL methodologies and scaffolds. Dual language  dictionaries, glossaries, texts, workbooks and testing materials are available to students (where applicable). Course materials  are made available in the students’ L1/HL when possible. Newcomers and SIFE students are provided with highly-scaffolded  materials and additional opportunities to develop the language skills they need to participate in class including, but not limited  to, one to one tutoring and in-class individual support. Long term ELLs are given additional support to leverage their BICS  proficiency into increased comfort with and skill in the use of academic language. We offer after school tutoring to all ELLs, in  addition to self-contained and integrated ESL programming. Students also have access to peer tutors in their native languages  (e.g. Haitian Creole, French, Spanish, Arabic, etc.), when possible, throughout the day to aid in their acquisition of the  academic and linguistic skills necessary to thrive in various content areas. One to two times per month, grade-level inquiry  teams of teachers meet to discuss student grades, classwork, participation, attendance records, graduation/college readiness  and Regents preparation. Staff conducts outreach for students who demonstrate challenges or appear to be falling behind in  one of the aforementioned categories. Teachers use this data to collaborate with students and parents to develop action plans  to support ongoing student success.    Response to Intervention (RTI) is introduced for ELL students who enter with lower levels of proficiency in the home language,  or if anticipated progress is not noted after a reasonable time period. If students are not successful in a Tier 1 (differentiated  instruction with periodic assessment to determine needs) instructional setting, the ENL teacher, Ms. Moylan, in collaboration  with Mr. Russo, Ms. Riley, and Mr. Feldman, works to incorporate Tier 2 interventions in ENL instruction. These interventions  involve clear, conceptually-oriented instruction that emphasizes the importance of drill, practice, and cumulative review along  with additional scaffolding that gives student the time and support needed to reach grade-level standards. Should Tier 2  interventions fail to provide adequate support that facilitates student success and growth, the ENL teacher and special  educators will collaborate to design Tier 3 intensive one-to-one supports including, but not limited to, pull-out instruction  (both ENL and SETSS), adapted texts, and additional opportunities for practice of critical skills that can be leveraged for success  in the classroom.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?     This year, in response to student performance in their courses and on the Regents, we are working to provide more  opportunities for content-based ENL instruction and support in both science and social studies (U.S. History, Participation in  Government, AP Human Geography). This will both support student acquisition of Tier II and Tier III vocabulary and bolster  their success in the content area classrooms/exams while also more broadly developing key language competencies that they  will need for success beyond high school. These partnerships will also facilitate the explicit development of disciplinary literacy  skills in these content classrooms. Additionally, we have increased access for ELLs to AP programming through co-developed  and co-taught AP coursework, ultimately providing stronger instruction for all of our students while creating more  opportunities for our ELLs. Further, we are working on developing our CTE program pathways through partnership and  collaboration opportunities between the ENL staff and CTE team. Maker will begin using the new learning management system  (LMS) Jumprope, which is simpler, facilitates easier access for all students and parents, and integrates data from a variety of  sources which better allows for the development of true data-driven instruciton.    Computer based instruction is being implemented to allow continued access to applications and instructional materials for  students including content based curricular materials. We are a 1-to-1 Chromebook school, and students use the Jumprope  platform to access grades and Google Classroom to access assignments in all content areas. Teachers use technology like  Camtasia to record explanations of material covered in class that students can then return to as they complete their  assignments. Students also have the ability to move through their coursework asynchronously; this allows the teachers in  math, science, and social studies to more effectively group students based on need and provide increasingly challenging work  to students who progress beyond others in the class. In Algebra I, Khan Acdemy (available in over 30 languages) is used to  supplement instruction. In our social studies courses, Castle Learning (also available in multiple languages) is used to  supplement in-class instruction. In ELA, students use WriteAbout to write daily in a semi-structured environment that allows  for peer feedback and easy editing. Students also use LightSail, a reading program for iPad, to develop their reading  comprehension skills and reading stamina.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   n/a     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  Programs during the school day are made available to ELLs through native language supports and with facilitation by our ENL  teacher-- Ms. Moylan checks in with ELLs on a regular basis to learn more about their level of involvement in school activities  and assist in navigating language or cultural barriers that may be limiting or otherwise adversely affecting their participation.  ELLs are encouraged to take advantage of all opportunities to participate in extracurricular programming and educational  support services. Invitations are sent home in English and in families' preferred language(s). Representation of ELLs in each  program varies depending on students’ individual academic needs and individual extracurricular preferences. UA Maker  Academy offers a variety of clubs (anime/gaming, GSA, spoken word, intramural basketball, fencing) and academic tutoring  options (Algebra I, Physics, Global Studies, ELA, to name a few) after school. ELLs are invited to participate in these  organizations via schoolwide emails/notices/postings, and these notices are supplemented with copies in ELLs’ native language  in order to ensure that all students are afforded equal information and access to these opportunities.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  All teachers differentiate and scaffold lessons, incorporate embedded checks for understanding, use visuals, cognates and,  wherever possible, offer materials in student’s home language(s). Additionally, bilingual dictionaries and glossaries are  available in each classroom. Data gathered from parent/guardian interviews regarding students’ academic history in native  language is taken into consideration when making instructional decisions. Student instructional expectations are guided by the  standards included in the CCLS Bilingual Progression and the Targets of Measurement (TOMs) established by the NYCDOE/SED;  outcomes are adjusted based on each student’s language proficiency and developmental needs.    The instructional materials used to support ELLs are:  dual language dictionaries, glossaries, texts and testing materials.  Additionally, teachers utilize web-based resources including (but not limited to) Fluency Tutor, Grammar-Works, and ESL  Galaxy. Newcomer students are provided with an iPad to facilitate personal translation and provide a greater number of  differentiation and language practice opportunities. We are a 1-to-1 Chromebook school, and students use the Jumprope  platform to access grades and Google Classroom to access assignments in all content areas. Teachers use technology like  Camtasia to record explanations of material covered in class that students can then return to as they complete their  assignments; they can also record lessons in other languages to allow students to access the same content, at the same time,  but in their preferred language.  In Algebra I, Khan Aacdemy is used and is available in multiple languages. In our social studies  courses, Castle Learning is available in multiple languages and is used to supplement in-class instruction.  In ELA, students use  WriteAbout to write daily in a semi-structured environment that allows for peer feedback and easy editing; students are  encouraged to use whichever language they prefer to respond to the prompts. Students also use LightSail, a reading program  for iPad, to develop their reading comprehension skills and reading stamina.  Ms. Moylan is developing a bilingual library to  support our students’ native language literacy. Students have access to multi-lingual textbooks in most classes, and on-the- spot translations are available to them via the Google Translate app. All teachers also use SmartBoards in their classroom,  which allows them to use visual supports and modeling in every lesson to help students understand new language and  concepts.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Content instruction is delivered in English, with home language support; students are encouraged to use their home language  when needed and they are evaluated using the ACTFL Global Language Standards in conjunction with the NYS Bilingual CC  Progression. This evaluation is facilitated through the use of in-house translators, translation services, and translation  programs.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All content area curricula are aligned to the Common Core State Learning Standards by grade level. They are supported using  ENL methodology and scaffolding techniques provided by and developed collaboratively between the ENL and content area   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55         teachers. All required services, support and resources used are appropriate for high school students, from Entering to  Commanding levels of English language proficiency. Utilizing IEP goals and lists of accommodations, ENL teachers and  instructional support service team coordinate modification of lessons, texts, graphic organizers, exam format, leveled readings,  and use of manipulatives and multimedia resources to ensure that ENL-SWD students receive grade-level content in an  appropriate delivery method for their cognitive and linguistic ability level.        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    UA Maker is collocated with three other programs (MECA, Murray Bergtraum, UA School of Emergency Management) and  shares resources in a variety of ways. Related service providers, both monolingual and bilingual, are shared among the  programs. Additionally, the four schools share resources and coordinate efforts to provide extracurricular opportunities like  clubs and PSAL sports, arts and music clubs, and supplementary academic activities like Mock Trial.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Parent Orientation and Curriculum Night are two of the activities that assist newcomers and parents before and during the  school year. Translation and interpretation are provided by school staff or facilitated through the TIU as needed. Prior to the  beginning of the school year, the ENL teacher (Ms. Moylan) in collaboration with the parent coordinator (Ms. Chesson) contact  incoming ELLs and their parents/guardians in their preferred language (with interpretation support), if the contact information  is available. This initial contact is attempted in order to welcome new students and their families to the school; to introduce  themselves; to answer any questions they may have; to notify them of upcoming school events, such as new student  orientation; and to inform them of services that are available to them, like translation and interpretation. Our school  counselor, Clint Fisher, helps ELL-SWDs transition into our environment through meetings with parents and students (with  translation and interpretation as needed). Newly-enrolled ELLs are also given a tour of the school and assigned a mentor  student who shares their HL to help them acculturate in a US high school environment. Ms. Moylan makes weekly  appointments to meet with newly-enrolled students to touch base about their experience so far and provide any additional  supports or follow-up that would contribute to the student’s success and comfort in their new school environment.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Spanish, American Sign Language (ASL)     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   n/a     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The professional development needs for all teachers who support our ELL population are met by providing monthly in-house  workshops, weekly teacher team meetings, and daily common planning meetings that emphasize strategies that content area  teachers can utilize to support ELLs. As per the UFT contract, Monday afternoons are also used for professional development  activities.  ENL PD is delivered in September (as an introduction to our incoming students' needs and foundational instructional  supports), December, January (prior to winter Regents to cover test accommodations), March, April (providing information   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56         about NYSESLAT testing), and June (prior to spring Regents to discuss test accommodations) . The professional development  programs are based on the belief that all teachers are teachers of literacy and that English as a Second Language is a natural  extension of this literacy skill instruction.  All teachers who teach ELLs have the opportunity to attend several professional  development workshops in ENL methodology outside of the school throughout the course of the year. These workshop topics  include Collaborative Co-Teaching, Strategies for the Success of Secondary ELLs, and Identifying and Supporting  SIFE/Newcomers. The information acquired at these workshops is then shared with all other teachers at collaborative  meetings where the new information and strategies are turn-keyed, discussed, and then implemented in a structured way  across content areas and reassessed after an agreed-upon timeline. Additionally, Ms. Moylan regularly meets both one-on-one  with a teachers who have requested assistance and with academic departments that seek content-specific ELL support.  In  daily common planning, the ENL teacher, Ms. Moylan, is present to provide an ENL lens as teachers discuss specific students,  their needs, and the various strategies that might support their linguistic and academic growth.    Teachers of ELLs utilize multiple DOE Professional Development opportunities throughout the year pertaining to grade specific  ENL instruction, the Common Core Learning Standards, and compliance issues. Additionally, Urban Assembly offers  Professional Development opportunities monthly, addressing how to target ELL needs while supporting CCLS-based  instruction. School-based Professional Development is offered on a variety of topics, including teaching academic vocabulary,  supporting the development of strong reading skills, encouraging productive academic discussions, and including language  objectives alongside content objectives. Off-site professional development opportunities through the DOE and RBERN are  made available to all teachers of ELLs and are shared by Ms. Moylan following receipt of the OELLs ENL teaher  newsletter/update or other notification of these activities     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  ENL teachers have the opportunity to participate in study groups that focus on instructional strategies and curriculuar  scaffolding and differentiation for ELLs. Teacher teams also meet on a weekly basis to discuss student data and progress  toward the next level of proficiency. Meetings may also focus on case studies, noticings from intervisitations, and challenges  that a teacher may have encountered in the classroom with respect to targeted language development. Outside of the school,  teachers are encouraged to seek out ELL-specific PD opportunities through the DOE OELLs and our RBERNs at NYU and  Fordham. Teachers are responsible for tracking their personal PD hours on their individual spreadsheets, along with storing  their agendas and related materials from PDs, and administration maintains records (attendance, agendas) of in-house  professional development activities on our school Google Drive.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   In September and October, parents of ELLs are invited to meet with their child’s ENL teacher for an initial planning  conference/check-in. Teachers discuss the students’ goals and progress and solicit feedback from parents with respect to their  child’s needs and strengths. Parents also receive reports reflecting the prior year’s NYSESLAT data. Interpretation services are  provided for parents whose language is other than English whenever needed, via an in-house or outside interpreter or using  the DOE Interpretation Hotline. The ENL teacher reaches out to parents via phone call or email on quarterly basis to discuss  their child’s English language development across content areas. Parents are invited in for follow-up meetings at the mid-year  point and at the end of the school year. Teachers document all the meetings in with sign-in sheets and agendas.    We individually meet with the parents or guardians of English language learners at least once a year, in addition to parent- teacher conferences, initial parent orientations, and quarterly progress meetings to discuss the goals of the program, their  child’s language development progress, their child’s English language proficiency assessment results, and language   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57            development needs in all content areas. This meeting includes school staff necessary to sufficiently inform the parents or  guardians about the child’s language development in all content areas in English (with some information about home language  development; however, we are not a TBE or DL program so extensive information is not provided)-- Katie Moylan, ENL  teacher/program coordinator, leads this meeting, and is joined by the content teachers who teach the student in question. The  meeting is conducted with a qualified interpreter/translator in the language or mode of communication the parent or guardian  best understands; if no interpreter/translator is available, the NYC DOE TIU Interpretation Hotline is used. Attendance is  documented with a sign-in sheet and parent certification that they were offered and attended the meeting.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   The parent coordinator, Birdie Chesson, is responsible for school-wide parent outreach. Ms. Chesson sends out bimonthly  parent newsletters, sets up parent meetings for student interventions, and plans and coordinates parent events like our Title I  meeting, Parent Association meetings, School Leadership Team meetings, and our beginning of the year Family Barbecue. Ms.  Chesson works with Ms. Moylan to ensure that parents are provided with translation and interpretation (via in-house staff,  TIU, or the DOE’s vendor, The Big Word) as needed.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Luke Bauer, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Urban Assembly Maker Academy                                                                              School DBN: 02M282  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Language preferences are assessed in a variety of ways. Initial information is gathered through ATS reports, HLIS  completion, and interviews conducted at time of admittance. The LAC and ENL teacher conduct ongoing  assessments and solicit feedback to ensure we are meeting parent community needs in a variety of ways,  including through school leadership meetings and parent conferences where use of in-house staff, parent  volunteers, and/or TIU/The Big Word staff are available to translate. At all school events, the families of students  who speak a HLOTE are provided with translations generated in-house and with outside support from the DOE  Translation and Interpretation Unit and via the language contractor, The Big Word. Translations are provided  according to the language preference indicated in ATS and modified as needed throughout the year following  feedback from parents during outreach and/or after completion of updates on Emergency Contact Cards. All  translation needs are also discussed during grade level advisory and department meetings and conveyed to the  ENL teacher and Parent Coordinator. Ms. Moylan, our ENL teacher, maintains a list of HLOTE that is regularly   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61      updated and is shared with all school staff. This is checked against student blue cards and ATS HL reports for  accuracy.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      In the event of a school emergency, the school would take several steps. First, we would utilize the text messaging  system, Kinvolved, which provides information that is translated in families’ preferred language. If we are unable to  contact parents in this way, we will utilize school bilingual staff to make phone calls to parents and will also use the  TIU hotline to supplement with any additional languages that are needed.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66       Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      The ENL teacher distributes information via email regarding translation and interpretation access at the beginning of  the year and follows up with reminders as parent-teacher conferences arise throughout the year. Teachers are  encouraged to save the translation hotline in their personal cell phones in case a parent requests a meeting and other  translation services are not immediately available. Additionally, the ENL teacher and parent coordinator post signs  near the school entrance in multiple languages offering translation services as needed. The ENL teacher and the  parent coordinator/LAC will offer a joint PD on translation and interpretation services in the fall and in the spring.           Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      The main entrance to the Murray Bergtraum campus is outfitted with the official DOE Welcome Poster, as is the  entrance on our floor. Parents receive a copy of the Parents’ Bill of Rights and Guide to Language Access at the  beginning of the school year and are encouraged to contact the administration, parent coordinator, or ENL teacher if  any questions arise. The Language ID guide is posted near the school’s main entrance and is distributed to the security  desk, main office, and parent coordinator.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       The school will distribute a survey at mid-year and at the end of the year so that adjustments can be made to provide  the services that parents need in order to be a fully-informed and active partner in their child’s education. Ms. Moylan  will coordinate with Ms. Chesson to create a parent focus group to gather feedback on their experience at UA Maker  and suggestions for improvement.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67
