This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   At PS 250, the Williamsburg Magnet School for Communications and Multimedia Arts, we believe each child is a  unique work of art contributing to the beautiful and diverse mosaic that is our school. Our goal as a professional  learning community is to provide each of our students with an educational program that is rigorous, challenging,  creative and inspiring. Our school community comprised of dedicated, highly-skilled and caring professionals, ensures  that every student receives an educational experience, in a safe and pleasant environment, reflecting his or her  individual interests, learning styles and academic and social/emotional needs. Our extensive curriculum embeds the  communications and multimedia arts throughout our students' program. PS 250 recognizes the vital and crucial role   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      that our students' families play in their academic success. We believe that engaging our parents in professional  learning, school events, and ongoing "conversations", will lead to our students reaching their fullest potential.       2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   P.S. 250, The Williamsburg Magnet School for Communications and Multimedia Arts is a dynamic and diverse learning  environment, whereby` all stakeholders work together in order to provide our students with a challenging and unique  learning experience. Our magnet theme of "Communications and Multimedia Arts" provides our students with an  unparalleled learning experience that incorporates the arts into all content areas. Our two new STEAM labs provide  our students with rigorous opportunities to engage in the sciences, math and technology.    Our school community comprised of dedicated, highly-skilled and caring professionals ensures that every student  receives an educational experience, in a safe and pleasant environment, that reflects his or her individual interests,  learning styles and academic and social/emotional needs. Our extensive curriculum embeds the communications and  multimedia arts throughout our students’ program. PS 250 recognizes the partnership that our students’ families play  in their academic success. We believe that engaging our families in professional learning, school events and ongoing  “conversations” of interest, will lead to our students reaching their fullest potential. In order to accomplish our  mission, we have several initiatives in place that have proven to be successful.. These include, "Book Buzz with the  Principal", Fabulous Fridays, Book of the Month, " Super Tuesdays", The Leader in Me Action Teams and Student  Lighthouse Team, ,Nabe 3.0, Collaborative Team and Vertical Planning, Inquiry Cycles of Learning.   "Book Buzz with the Principal" is a monthly initiative in which selected students from every class meets with the  principal to discuss a favorite book along with informal conversations about their school experiences thus far. This  encourages improvement in the students' reading skills as well as providing them with an outlet to voice their  opinions. "Fabulous Fridays"is a monthly initiative whereby parents are invited to visit their child's classroom and  participate in a special event focusing on an aspect of the curriculum. The school wide "Book of the Month" initiative  is aligned with "The Leader in Me" positive behavioral school wide approach, in which a specific book is celebrated  and discussed with the children each month. We will be embarking on our third year with The Leader in Me  social/emotional framework. The core values of The Leader in Me facilitates and cultivates a school environment that  focuses on positive behavior and developing students as role models and leaders. Our collaboration with our CBO, St.  Nick's Alliance and their program "Nabe 3.0" assists our students who are experiencing academic and  social/emotional challenges. This program is led by a youth coach who supports the students within their school  environment.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Our Chinese/English Dual Language program will expand to the 2nd grade and provide academic, social/emotional  supports for our ENL's as well as providing the opportunity for our English dominant students to immerse themselves  in a second language.   Our English as New Language students comprise approximately 17% of our student population. Their specific needs  are language-based and require instructional strategies that support their oral and written vocabulary development in  their dominant language as well as English. Our Chinese/English Dual Language program, will support our students  whose dominant language is Chinese. Our ENL’s require pedagogical tools that support their learning. These include  visual prompts, graphic organizers, Spanish and Asian language texts and audio/visual software programs.  Our Students with Special Needs comprise 11% of our school population. These students are dispersed among our  Integrated Co-teaching classes and one self-contained 3/4/5 bridge class., They have varying needs ranging from  academic to behavioral. Many of these students have delayed reading skills which require explicit and systematic  instruction. Since our students with special needs have multiple learning modalities, resources and materials must be  modified to meet their needs. For those students who are transitioning from the most restrictive environment  (12:1:1) to a least restrictive one , emotional, as well as academic support is needed. This year, we have implemented   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      the "Fundations" program as an additional support for both groups of students as well. Our School Implementation  Team (SIT) , school wide social/emotional framework, "The Leader in Me" and our RTI framework supports the  identification of the students' special needs, along with developing a plan for improvement. Our professional learning  Cycles and Professional Learning Teams also provide support to our teachers in meeting the special needs of these  subgroups. Our staff will continue to participate in district collaborative shares with a focus on supporting these  subgroups.     4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   With reference to the Framework for Great Schools, and as evidenced in the 2017-18 School Quality Guide Multi-Year  Summary, we have made continuous progress in several areas. These include: Rigorous Instruction, Supportive  Environment, Effective School Leadership and Trust. With respect to the Framework for Great Schools and the Survey  Element scores, in the past three years, we have made significant progress in the area of Rigorous Instruction (2.86 in  '16 to 4.09 in '18). In addition we have also made gains in the areas of Effective School Leadership (2.5 in'16 to 3.4 in  '18) as well as Strong Family Community Ties and Trust. We will continue to facilitate an environment of Collaborative  Teachers, with an increase in vertical planning and grade teams using a specific protocol for examining student work.  In addition, we will continue to engage families in relevant workshops on "Terrific Tuesdays" with a menu of  workshops distributed to parents in a timely calendar. The Leader in Me Action Teams and Student Lighthouse  members will meet bi monthly to assess progress in meeting school wide goals. All correspondences sent home will  continue to be available in three languages (English, Chinese, Spanish).

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).  This transition requires both planning and collaboration. Easing and strengthening this transition is vital to ensuring  the ongoing benefits of Pre-K educational experiences. We will initiate meetings to encourage and foster inter and  intra staff communication in order to begin planning for this transition.   A smooth transition can be achieved by providing age-appropriate curriculum within all the early childhood grades.  Opportunities for communication and cooperation can be facilitated throughout the year. A variety of continuity and  transition activities can support the “moving-on” experience.   Communication Tips for Staff   Pre-K teachers possess important knowledge about their Pre-K students, which could prove helpful to their future  Kindergarten teachers. One of the basic ways this information can be shared is through use of a transition form. We  will create, adopt and use transition forms.   In addition, transition tools for parents (Parent-School Relationships) will be created and/or shared. We will  communicate the requirements of the school system and the resources available. Social/Emotional supports for  students and families will be embedded with the Leader in Me framework.           4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34      Collaborative inquiry teams, Instructional Cabinet, Professional Learning Committees and grade level teams engage in  the decision making process in regards to the use of appropriate assessments . These teams have created a calendar  of dates to meet regularly. In addition the master school schedule provides grade teams with 3 common preps  weekly.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 250, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       [PS 250] will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g .ESSA/State accountability  system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning  Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the ESSA;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

Content instruction aligned closely with grade level curriculum is provided for  English Language Learners (ELLs) using ENL methodologies.  There are currently  65 ELLs enrolled at PS 250 serviced, in their respective classes, by 2 certified ESL teachers and  1 teacher with a NYS Bilingual Common Branch certification.In order to increase academic  achievement and improve English language proficiency among our students, we will use our  Title III funding for the following:- Extended day program aligned with New York  State  Learning Standards- Thematic approach integrating all four modalities: Listening,  speaking, reading and writing- ELLs  will be grouped heterogenously, in flexible groups, to  foster cooperative and peer-assisted learning.  - Program duration: 27  sessions  meeting twice  per week on Wednesday and Thursday, for 2 hours per session ( serving ELLs in grades 2-5).- subgroups to be served: entering, emerging, transitioning, expanding in grades 2-5.  There will be approximately 2 groups of students.  There will be approximately 15 students in each group.  Tentative dates: Feb. 27- June 5, 2019  Teachers and Certifications: Mr.Lentol, permanent TESOL, Ms. Levin permanent  TESOL certification.   Projected funds allocation:Direct instruction: 60%, Parental Involvement 10%, Professional  Development 10%,  20 % OTPS ( refreshments/snacks/supplies for parent workshops)ENL  Thematic Approach integrating dramatic techniques:Languages of instruction: primary language  EnglishHome language support will be provided in Spanish and Chinese Students learn and  practice language structures and academic vocabulary using a variety of dramatic techniques and  theatrical activities including: role-play/simulations, pantomime, guided improvisation, writing  and performing mini-skits, and jazz chants.  Each session will focus on a multicultural theme.  The last session will be a culminating performance project.Materials:All materials used will be  from PS 250's ENL resources and library including ( leveled books, bilingual books, tool kits,  literacy center activities).  Some materials from students' content work will be used to provide  direct instructional support.Daily activities include : shared reading, close reading with text- based questions, creating domain and academic vocabulary mapping / graphic organizers,  taxonomies, interactive writing, collaborative writing of skits, and dramatic role play.Attendance  Records will be maintained by the individual after-school teachers and kept in the ENL Files in  room 202.    Rationale:Drama is a highly effective vehicle for teaching ELLS :-Promotes language  acquisition through meaningful interactions.-Makes language learning exciting and accessible .- Motivates and builds self-confidence.- Dramatic activities incorporate multiple learning styles (  kinesthetic, visual, auditory etc..) ensuring that students' learning potential is heightened.- Games  and fun activities foster a playful, non-threatening, supportive environment which is key to  enhancing learning.-Dramatic activities provide ample opportunity to foster self-expression,  creativity and independent thinking.-Promotes teamwork, cooperative learning, social awareness,  empathy ( acting requires "walking in another person's shoes")-Develops  fluency, pronunciation   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45            Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   and effective delivery of language in a contextualized meaningful way.-Results in higher  retention of language learning because of enhanced engagement level.  Students included in the program will be selected based on their academic needs, as determined  by their scores on formal state assessments (e.g. State ELA in grades 3, 4 and 5) as well as data  from classroom formative and summative assessments, and their linguistic needs, based on their  scores on the NYSELAT, NYSITELL and analysis of ENL Stand-alone and Integrated work  products.

ENL teachers will continue to attend relevant ELL professional development  throughout the year - including PD offered by District 14 and RBERN.     There will be ongoing professional development by ENL teachers for other staff members  responsible for the delivery of instruction and services for ELLs. These workshops will be free of  cost. Topics to be covered will  closely mirror the District 14 PDs.  our BFSC and RBERN.  The  objective is to deepen our staffs' sensitivity towards, and understanding of, the specific academic  and social/ emotional needs of our ELL students. Given that the majority of our teachers have  ELLS in their classroom, teachers will receive PD that will support them in more fully engaging  ELLs by detailing strategies for making content more accessible and meaningful. In order for our  staff to keep abreast of the most current ELL strategies and best practices our ELL and other  staff members will be given the option to attend workshops and professional  learning opportunities throughout the course of each year.

Research shows that students  who have involved parents perform better and achieve more academically and  socially.  Consequently, we engage our parents in multiple ways during the school year. Our  ELL parents are encouraged to participate fully in school activities. Important notices are sent  home in different languages. Our ELL parents are invited to participate in school committees,  such as:  School Safety, Attendance Committee, Pupil Personnel and our School Leadership  Team.  They are encouraged to join the Parents Association and attend meetings. Translators are  provided at all meetings. Parents are also invited to our Fabulous Friday Events and  Parent  Workshops spearheaded by our parent coordinator.   During Parent-Teacher conferences  Spanish and Chinese translators are available.  Agendas, attendance logs, and invitations will be  send out in parents preferred languages and will be kept in the ENL files.Translation needs of  parents will be met by ENL and bilingual certified teachers as well as staff members who are  proficient in the native language of parents.Currently, we have alliances with several Community  Based Organizations which provide services to ELL parents. The St. Nicholas Alliance runs, not  only, a student after school program here, but also has workshops for parents and a literacy  program. Our parent coordinator serves an integral role in facilitating communication between  parents, community-based organizations and members of the school community. She maintains  regular contact with our ELL parents addressing their concerns and questions.  She also  facilitates workshops and is instrumental in discerning the needs and interests of our parents.  Two parent workshops will be scheduled for the academic school year 2018-2019.

The assessment tools we use to assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs include: Fountas and Pinnell reading levels, ongoing  running records, Lab-R levels, NYSESLAT, NYSITELL proficiency levels, baseline and units assessments from Core Knowledge and  Expeditionary Learning, and MOSL, for reading and writing.                            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   We are continuing to integrate Teacher's College Writing Program which supports ELLs' language acquisition and  literacy development through an instructional plan that includes: teaching explicit writing strategies, demonstrating revision,  editing conventions and elaboration, phonemic awareness, spelling patterns, high frequency words in context ( mini- lessons  and shared/ interactive writing, teacher modeling, encouraging students to respond to texts of multiple genres, modeling  fluency (through interactive read alouds , and responding/ reflecting during independent writing. We have found that  this modeling of writing along with ample opportunities  to practice results in improved writing skills.    We are continuing the opportunities for rich language conversations using accountable talk and academic vocabulary across  the curriculum, since oral language skills are an essential component of student's language and form the foundation of writing  skills.  We have also added the Fundations Program to support our struggling readers and writers in the lower grades. This research  based program with an emphasis on phonics and phonemic awareness , and word study strengthened our literacy  instruction.       3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The summative assessments used to identify baseline, progress and area of need are:   NYSITELL/ NYSESLAT scores, running  records, inquiry work, MOSL, portfolios, and teacher narratives on ELLs'. We continually review and evaluate the strengths and  weaknesses of our programs by identifying trends and patterns in our data. This helps us to remain as responsive as possible to  the changing needs of our ELLs'.        4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    The following structures are in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered: We use the  RTI Guide for ELLs' in order to ensure that a rigorous and systematic intervention model is adhered to throughout the school  community.  Essential to The RTI model is high quality Tier 1 classroom instruction that is responsive to the particular linguistic  and cultural needs of Ells'.   We have an RTI team consisting of the following staff members: C. Siegal Assistant Principal,  L.Jacob, IEP teacher, E. Torres, ENL teacher, C. Byrd, Speech teacher, A. Colianni, Academic intervention specialist, S. Bertin,  Psychologist, M. Soler, Social worker.        5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Within the Response to Intervention Framework, our school uses data we have gathered on our ELLs to identify, as quickly as  possible, those in need of academic support.  Our main goal is to create a strong, supportive, and responsive classroom  environment so as to minimize the need for further intervention.    At the Tier I level, PS 250, is implementing the following school wide initiatives and instructional practices which pertain to all  students including our ELLs.  These school wide initiatives carefully consider the language acquisition, cultural, and socio- emotional needs of our ELLs.    Given that all students, and especially ELLs, need a positive, inclusive and respectful environment that supports the students'  social and emotional growth, as well as their academic learning, we are continuing to use the Leader In Me.  The Leader In Me  Program provides a strong foundation for all students including our ELLs  by building a culture of collaboration, respect and  student empowerment based on a set of shared values, expectations and behaviors  outlined in the 7 habits.  The key factor  here is a responsive and flexible school-wide system which continually monitors progress and requires teachers to adjust  instruction to meet the needs of each student.     We believe that our ELLs will become more engaged and excited about learning because they will feel like valued members of  a collaborative community of learners. Morning meetings will be an integral part of every classroom, as well as practices  designed to make the classroom more joyful, stimulating, child centered, challenging, and developmentally appropriate.   To heighten motivation, and to foster students' ownership of their own education, Instructional practices will include:   student choice, where students are able to choose an appropriate differentiated, learning activity which takes into  account  proficiency levels , and culturally specific interests. .  Since the groundwork for RTI for ELLs is high quality core instruction, which centers on language and literacy development, we  will continue the process of integrating new curriculum school-wide . Both Core knowledge and Expeditionary Learning have   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51         proven to be rigorous and effective in NYC classrooms.  For the struggling ELLs we plan on developing intensive scaffolding  methods, which take into account the students' cultural and linguisitc background, language proficiency level and individual  learning style. The integrated teaching model, where a certified ENL teacher supports the regular classroom teacher, will be an  essential component in supporting our ELLs' at the Tier I level.        6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].       The outcome assessment data we use to evaluate and inform our ELL programs are : NYSESLAT, ELA, and Math.  If we look at the data across the levels, it becomes apparent that the majority of our students are making progress moving  through the 5 proficiency levels in a logical progression from Entering to Expanding.  The majority of our students,  however,  concentrate at the Expanding level, and do not reach the Commanding level.    While the distribution of proficiency levels on grades 1-3 shows students making the greatest progression in reaching the  Expanding level, in grades 4 and 5 the percentages are lower in the Expanding level.     Furthermore, in grade 5, there is a slower progressions through proificiency levels.   Nonetheless, the pattern seems to point  to the fact that it is harder to test out of ENL services in the upper grades.   This does not negate the fact that a vast majority of  our students did reach the Expanding level which shows significant and steady growth.                             7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The structures we have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to our programs include: Grade  meetings, team meetings, ongoing informal meetings of ENL teachers with classroom teachers, Professional Learning  committees.            Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.           In order to meet the Language needs of our ELLs' we follow the servicing and scheduling requirements in CR Part  154 (Grades K to 5)  as detailed in the chart on Page 15 Titled " Part 154-2 (K-8 English as New Language (ENL) Units of  Study and Staffing Requirements.     To best meet the needs of our ELLs while adhering to the requirements of CR Part 154.2, PS 250 provides  ELL  instruction through an integrated co-teaching and a standalone models.  The largest component of ENL  instruction will be delivered through the integrated model in which an ENL teacher co-teachers with the regular  classroom teacher during literacy core content blocks. Within the classroom proficiency levels are mixed. During the  Standalone instruction, however, the proficiency levels are more homogeneous but the grade levels often are mixed.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52         For example, our newcomers and emerging students from grades 3-5 are often grouped together.  Transitioning and  expanding students are frequently grouped together for purpose of targeted writing instruction. We attempt to  remain relatively flexible with our groupings so as to better serve the evolving needs of our students.                   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.           c.  DL program.  If applicable.       We will continue to offer Dual Language Program and we will be extending the program to second grade.  The  language allocation for the program model is 50% English and 50% Mandarin, K is self-contained, 1/2 is side by side.   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              We program all our students using STARS cross referencing NYSESLAT/ NYSITELL scores and students' proficiency levels  to ensure that the mandated number of instructional minutes are provided according to proficiency levels.    In order to comply with Part 154-2 mandates.   We ensure that we meet the servicing minutes requirements of entering,  emerging, transitioning, expanding and commanding by allowing for flexibility within grouping based on the ELLs mandates.  We provide ELLs with instruction in each program according to proficiency level and required minutes as follows:     Entering : 2 units of study ( 360 minutes) : 1 stand alone, 1 integrated ( ENL/ELA)   Emerging: 2 units of study (360 minutes) :  1/2 stand alone, 1 integrated (ENL/ELA) , Flexibility:  1/2 stand- alone   Transitioning: 1 unit of study (180 minutes):  Integrated ENL/ELA 1/2 (90 minutes) Flexibility:  1/2 ( content area)  Expanding : I unit of study ( 180 minutes):  1 ENL/ELA or content area   Commanding:  Flexible (90 minutes)                3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      We use a variety of instructional approaches and methods to make content comprehensible including :  scaffolding  instruction  by using a spiral approach, thinking maps, graphic organizers, drama techniques, targeting content area vocabulary  instruction, extensive oral language development around core content curriculum , visual aids/realia, and  picture dictionaries.  In order to support our students with meeting the content and language objectives  we incorporate close  readings and higher level thinking skills. We build background knowledge using multiple resources ( smart board, high interest  texts with enticing illustrations/ photos, sketches).  We modify instruction where necessary and facilitate entry into content  area discussion by focusing on explicit instruction in language by using conversation/sentence starters and front loading direct  teaching of Tier III vocabulary .  We provide a solid foundation in spoken language upon which to build the other language  modalities. We integrate shared/interactive writing as well as read alouds with accountable talk to maximize the opportunities  for language modeling and developing critical thinking skills. When the need arises and where possible, we also use the home  language as support; several of our teachers are bilingual ( English, Spanish and Mandarin)       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?         We ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home language in several ways including:        ENL teachers interview Spanish speaking students in their home language and continue to evaluate them at periodic   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      intervals throughout the year. We also use informal running records using texts in students' home language ( when  available)  to assess their literacy skills.     ENL teachers evaluate Asian students by using an interpreter to determine fluency in  their home language. In the case where there isn't a home speaking pedagogue, or aid , we ask an adult family member or a  LTI  interpreter to help us.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status                   For all ELL subgroups our goal is ensure that curriculum is supported with research based scaffolds based on the academic,  social and linguistic needs of the individual student.                  It is crucial that teachers foster both the socio-emotional and academic development of SIFE students. Many SIFE  students require extra support in order for them to have a healthy acclimation process and make an effective transition.  Instructional strategies will vary depending on the level of home language proficiency. Whenever possible we look for entry  ways to grade level curriculum  by utilizing ENL methodology, scaffolding etc. in an effort to make content meaningful. We  attempt to bridge the gap between home language/culture and school language/culture by taping into students interest areas  and making explicit  cultural connections. SIFE students are grouped together with their peers in age appropriate  homogeneous classrooms. Whenever possible we build on the home language literacy skills in order to secure a foundation  upon which to transfer new language skills.               Newcomers are serviced with the intention of giving them the Basic language skills (BICS) needed to function and feel  comfortable in their new environment while acquiring sufficient English language skills to participate as fully as possible in the  classroom.  We use ENL methodology as mentioned above which centers on embedding lessons with  multiple layers of  scaffolding: roll play/drama, realia, maps, photos, videos, manipulatives, preview/review lesson format,  graphic organizers,  dialogue journals with the teacher or peers, etc.  As holds true for all our instruction, but particularly important for our ELLs,  teachers make sure to present information in many ways to engage students with different learning styles.            Newcomers are placed in age appropriate heterogeneous classrooms so as to offer them multiple opportunities for  language acquisition and enhance extrinsic motivation and peer support. Newcomers are also pulled out in small  homogeneous groups to best hone in on their specific language acquisition needs.            Developing students need extensive and explicit instruction in content area academic vocabulary in order to render grade  level texts comprehensible. They also need extra support in developing writing skills across the content areas.  We  are  focusing on raising the level of discussion around close readings (while integrating academic vocabulary), because not only will  this improve the critical thinking skills of our students, but it will also form the foundation for better writing.     Long term ELLs are serviced under the premise that each student progresses at his/her individual rate through the language  acquisition stages. According to the natural order of language acquisition, students develop BIS first and CALP second. Our long  term ELLs, however generally seem to get stuck at the intermediate and advanced levels proficiency because they lack the  crucial academic language necessary for their reaching the commanding level.  Long term ELLs display significant gaps in  reading complex grade level texts, and their writing lacks the language necessary for more complex expression.  Because long  term ELLs often have an insufficient command of academic language they often become hesitant participants in the  classroom.  In order to address these issues we are differentiating and scaffolding instruction so that literacy skills targeting  academic vocabulary, grammar and syntax, and reading comprehension, are embedded in all instruction.     We are also focusing on teaching explicit study skills and meta-cognitive practices that develop behaviors that are essential for  academic engagement and success.      Former ELLs  are provided with continued support through our integrated co-teaching model. Former ELLs often have similar  needs as Long term ELLs ( as outlined above), therefore we follow a similar instructional focus on developing higher level   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      literacy skills  and academic vocabulary. We focus on raising the level of expression in writing and speaking so that students  are able to articulate coherent arguments and point of view.  We believe that as their language becomes more sophisticated  they will develop the confidence to express themselves as independent critical thinkers.        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   At PS 250 we have a relatively small population of ELLS who are designated as SWDs. This population receives individualized  instruction from the classroom teacher, the SETTS teacher, paraprofessionals, and the ENL staff, as prescribed by their IEP.           Teacher collaboration is essential to ensure congruent and focused planning.  . We will make sure both curriculli are  accessible to ELLS/SWDs by applying the appropriate scaffolding strategies as mentioned above. We will also use our guided  reading library to support and allow for differentiation.  Our SETTS teacher provides ongoing PD on teaching SWDs  .  Our resources also include native language texts.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  There are several ways that our school uses curricular, instructional and scheduling flexibility to meet the diverse needs ELL- SWDs in the least restrictive environment.  In order for ELL-SWDS to receive a rigorous education, the Special education and  ENL teachers confer with the grade level teachers to produce curriculum maps and give input into the lesson planning  (modifying and scaffolding instruction) as well as  monitor students' academic and socio-emotional progress.  Schedules are  designed to facilitate an integrated co-teaching model and to make sure that ELL-SWD receive their mandated  services.  Curriculum is scaffolded specifically to meet the academic challenges and learning styles as articulated in the  students' IEP. When appropriate we also make use of a computer software- based curriculum ( Award Reading).  This program  motivates many ELLs and helps them build reading comprehension, phonics, word study and sight words.            8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  We offer several after school programs to aid in the preparation of the state tests.  There are typically three types of programs  offered: ELA and Math test sophistication, and in the Summer we also provide an ELL program targeting ito grades 2-5  integrating literacy skills. Whenever possible, we incorporate home language supports.  In the areas of Social studies and  Science we are re-organizing our programming in order to add targeted co-teaching support when and where it is most  needed.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Since we are a multi-media and communications magnet school, some of the new improvements we are making school wide  involve the continued use and integration of technology in our teaching. Every classroom has a smart board and a document  camera with which to aid in teaching. Staff is continuously learning new ways of incorporating this new technology in order to  ensure that our students are prepared for the continued technological developments in our world.   We also have a theatre Arts program  which will focus on developing language and literacy skills.    We have been awarded an ELL STEM grant and a STEAM program integrated with technology.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?    None of the programs/ services that we currently offer our ELLs will be discontinued. This is contigent upon the Budget.      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All our ELLs are included and encouraged to participate in all school programs and supplemental services including :  After school programs.   Any school program that is being offered at PS 250 is open to all students regardless of ELL status.  The programs main focus is   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      on language and literacy development.  Currently Saint Nicks Alliance services our students after school in our school site.        12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  The ENL program uses materials pulled from various programs and curriculum in addition to teacher created materials  including the following:  - Core knowledge ( we will be implementing this program, as well as,  Expeditionalry Learning for the first time this year)   -Expeditionary Learning  - Fundations  - Award Reading  - Teachers College Writing Curriculum   -Exemplars  -Independent Investigative Method ( IIM)   -Safari Montage  - Multilevel Nonfiction Books    -GO Math  - High interest low level books   -National Geographic Video  - Leader In Me  -Readers Theater    -Trout in the Classroom science initiative  -STEAM:  science program integrating technology, engineering, arts, and math  _ Amplify Science     As previously mentioned, ENL teachers often include technology to support instruction. This is especially true for newcomers  who at first must rely heavily on visual clues to aid in comprehension.  This might mean a short video on elephants is shown to  a group prior to reading a book about how elephants adapt to their environment.  This kind of ENL strategy helps our students  activate and/ or build prior knowledge before diving into a new topic.   Document cameras are often used during writing or reading instruction to showcase and discuss anchor texts, students writing  and for shared annotation of texts.    IPads are used to develop literacy through words games, digital books, etc.  Guided reading books with strong picture support and predictable patterned sentences are frequently used, particularly with  our Entering and Emerging students.   Given that our students need a lot of support with vocabulary/ unfamiliar words in order to ensure comprehension of a text (  or spoken language)  we use dictionaries ( both picture and two languages)  computer images, photos, flash cards,  etc. which  provide students with multiple exposures to targeted vocabulary words .    Hands on materials such as magnetic letters, white boards, sentence strips, index cards, are used for all sorts of literacy  building activities.        13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   The home language is used, whenever possible, in the classroom, by the ENL teachers and school personnel to provide support  and clarification for our ELLs. This is especially necessary to assure that content and concepts in the subject areas are made  comprehensible.    We have home language materials available as part of our ENL libraries as well as in our school library .  These texts are used to  maintain and foster home language literacy and fluency.  Parents of ELLs are encouraged to read to their child, whenever  possible in their home language. Parents and ELLs are encouraged to borrow bilingual and home language books from our  libraries.  Teachers, when possible and appropriate, use the home language to aid in communicating with our ELL population.  In the dual language model, home language is supported by translating all school parent communications as well as  instructional materials.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56         14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.   As per Chancellors Regulation A101,  students are placed in age appropriate classrooms and small group settings. ENL  teachers  collaborate with classroom teachers about curriculum, specific lessons, vocabulary and language acquisition issues of  our ELL students, so that every attempt is made to make grade level content comprehensible.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    N/A        16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   When newly enrolled ELLs come to our school with limited or no English we make an effort to personalize their introduction by  having the ENL teacher introduce them to  their classroom teacher.  The ENL teacher, whenever possible provides a guided  tour of the school visiting the places they will be frequenting:  library, cafeteria, art room, steam lab etc.  A buddy system is set  up to help the student with the transition.  The buddy, whenever possible,  speaks the students' home language.  Because  systems are in place ( interview process, parent orientation Etc..) to optimize communication with the parents/guardians and  the school community we hope to make the transition as smooth as possible.  It is understood that many new immigrant  students may experience culture shock and/ or go through a "silent period" so the ENL teacher makes sure to maintain  ongoing communication with the classroom teacher and parents should any issues arise.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?      N/A     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   The Dual Language model we use is self-contained. 50% Academic instruction is in English and 50% is  delivered in Mandarin. The Kinder garden  is self-contained, we use a side by side model for grades  1/2 . The EPs and ELLS are integrated throughout the day. . The content area subjects are all equally  taught in Mandarin and English.  Emergent literacy is taught simultaneously.             Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.

Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.    The minimum hours of ENL training are met  through weekly Monday professional development (which includes supports and  scaffolding techniques for ELLs),  half-day workshops, and through our ENL department updates provided by ENL teachers. We  have a professional development committee ( comprised of dedicated staff members) who take charge of organizing  professional development and making sure that we adhere to the mandated guidelines as per CR 154.2, to include 15%  dedicated to language acquisition and best practices for integrated co-teaching as well as language and content area  instruction for ELLs.  Our ENL teachers receive 50% of their Professional development in aligning language acquisition levels to  the content area.  Our Professional development team keeps records of total hours, attendance, and agendas.

Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   An integral component of PS 250's vision, as articulated in the Mission Statement, is the belief that the school home  connection is essential to the academic success of students. " PS 250 recognizes the vital and crucial role that our students'  families play in their academic success. We believe that engaging our parents in professional learning, school events, and  ongoing conversations,will lead to our students reaching their fullest potential".  In effort to fulfill this mission we are  increasing our outreach to parents in the following ways:    -Classroom teachers send monthly News Letters which highlight parental involvement events. We plan on offering workshops  for parents of ELLs  about following topics:  -strategies to enhance language acquisition and support home language  - literacy enrichment at home  - Nights of the Arts and Steam Expo         We also are working on increasing the number of ELL parents who attend our Fabulous Fridays.  During these Fridays ( once a  month)  parents work with their child in the classroom on special activities/ projects.  Our Fabulous Fridays often center  around a cultural theme such as Hispanic Heritage, or Chinese New Year.  Classroom teachers are keeping logs of parents who  attend Fabulous Fridays, making phone calls to encourage parents who have not yet attended to take advantage of this  opportunity. During all events/ activities we keep attendance logs and follow established protocol involving contacting parents  to encourage them to participate in scheduled events.   We have expanded our Parent involvement activities to include : Take your Dad to School Day, breakfast event, a student  basketball clinic for parents and students, Spring Dance, Common Threads (Small Bites), Family Art workshops such as : Mosaic  of Art, OrIgami,Latin Percussion, Treasure Box, Mask Making, Writing Celebrations.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Roseann LaCioppa, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   George H.

We keep precise records regarding their choice, so that all information is  provided in their respective languages. Teachers and administrators have access to Emergency Contact cards in a  central location in the main office. We have many staff members available to provide written and oral translations.  Our ENL team, parent coordinator, dual language teachers , school aides and a paraprofessional will also provide the  necessary oral translations.            Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      We will continue to designate a portion of professional development time to informing our staff on using translation  services. Our language translation team will ensure helpful pertinent information is distributed during this PD  including Language ID Guide, Palm Card etc. There is a Translation and Interpretation brochure posted in the school  and procedures on how to use over-the-phone interpretation services have been communicated to the staff. We  currently have several staff members who are able to provide Spanish and Chinese Translation services for our  parents. However, we intend to use the Translation & Interpretation Unit to provide services in Arabic, if the need  arise we will use an outside vendor.          Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      PS 250 will continue to fulfill parental notification requirements for translation and interpretation services, as per  Section VII of Chancellor's Regulation A-663 by designating the Translation and Interpretation Team as overseeing the  process ensuring that notifications are translated and that information is disseminated in a timely fashion. We work  on increasing parental awareness regarding parents' right to and the availability of language services.           Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       There is a parent survey that we will use to aid us in gathering information from parents about the quality and  effectiveness of the services provided. We will use the survey to highlight areas in which we can improve the quality  and availability of services.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64
