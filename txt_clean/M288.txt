This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Growth:   In 2016-17, the school focused on higher level of collaboration among teachers and administration in regards to  learning partnerships. From the beginning of the school a structure of year grade level teams were created. this was a  need voiced by the staff at the close of the previous academic year. The structure was as follows: grade level team  leader and grade level manager.   Focus:   The focus for the 2016-17 school year is to continue to strengthen inquiry by providing additional support to teacher  teams to nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, and team leaders based on professional learning  activities. Focusing on various data collected through regents scores, MOSL's, credits accumulation, common trends,  graduation rates, college and career readiness index, etc. In addition we will continue to build on and to improve the  incorporation of assessment within the classroom (Danielson 3d), using questioning and discussion techniques  (Danielson 3b); as well as, improving collaboration between the special education team with its general education  team. Additionally to continue to collaborate with teachers to improve classroom instruction as part of the  Framework for Great Schools.                     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 02M288   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   09,10,11,12   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   378   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.        Based on data obtained from: Advance (2016-17) 3b and 3d, professional conversation between staff during inquiry,  pre and post observation conferences, content and grade level meetings and the Quality Review (2016-17), it is  apparent that teacher teams need to engage in the inquiry process to use assessment in instruction. Through the  continued work of the 16-17 school year of using questioning and discussion technique to increase assessment of  students, teacher teams will use standardized assessment data to guide instruction and development of rigorous  lesson plans.      According to the data, the use of higher level of questions has increased across classrooms; however, an area of focus  is the fostering of student discussion through higher level questioning.   It is evident that teachers assess students consistently, however, building on a student’s ability to self-assess and  assessing their peers, needs to be strengthened. Students self-assessing will better prepare them to take a more  active role in their learning. Additionally, data from assessments should continue to drive instruction and how their  academic needs are being met.   2017-18 Term 2.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Food and Finance High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I,  Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Food and Finance High School will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training sessions to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement  level, e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   Parents have been asked to complete a survey of their needs and interest and the Parent Coordinator in collaboration  with the PA Executive board to analyze the needs and determine priorities.    The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association and Title I Parent  Committee;   ● supporting or school community events;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school calendar for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format, and to the  extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.   ● Communicating with parents using phone and texting system (School Messenger) in regards to student attendance,  meetings, announcements and surveys.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?       1) The following formative assessments and curriculum – embedded assessments are being used to guide instructional  planning for our ELLs:     Beginning of Year Assessment (BoY) for Measure of Student Learning (MoSL) for baseline data  End of Year Assessment (EoY) fov Measure of Student Learning (MoSL) for formative and summative data  Diagnostic exam in Achieve 3000 to determine initial lexile scores in both English and available native languages  Embedded formative assessments in Achieve 3000 to continuously measure lexile score data in both English and available   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      native languages  8th Grade New York State exams (English Language Arts, Math, Science) scores to use for initial planning and programming  Previous year’s New York State summative exam scores (Regents, NYSESLAT) to use for initial planning and programming  Various teacher – created assessments aligned to Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS) and Targets of Measurement  (ToMs) used throughout the school year including but not limited to the use of rubrics, surveys, ranges of test and  performance scores, self- and peer- assessment forms, and observable data such as the effects of strategic questioning and  answering and the fostering of high level classroom discussions.       2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2) We use formative and curriculum – embedded assessments to guide instructional planning for our ELLs.  Structures that we  have in place to support this effort include:     - Analyzing data generated from both formative assessments and curriculum – embedded assessments for programming  students into specific classes targeting specific needs each term (i.e. – Additional content- or skill- targeted electives for  students performing below grade-level on formative assessments; Advanced Placement (AP) classes for students performing  above grade – level in specific content area exams.)  -Analyzing and targeting content skills needed for students to be successful in each academic discipline in both content – area  teams and grade – level teams during common planning time  -Analyzing data to create skill and content targeted formal and informal study groups for ELLs in English and with native  language support (i.e. - Informal lunch discussions with speakers of the same languages; formal after school tutoring; shared  Google Docs with translations; peer tutoring)  -Documenting student progress electronically via Google classrooms, emails, and Skedula.  -Progress monitoring through PupilPath/Skedula in both English and available native home languages available to students,  families, and school personnel.    -Creating guiding questions that focus on targeted instruction based on data  -Involving teachers and staff in Professional Learning Opportunities (PLOs) about using data to drive instruction     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?   3) Summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need include:     -New York State assessments (Regent Exams, NYSESLAT)  -End – of – unit test (Including materials from JMap, Pearson Common Core, Houghton Mifflin Collections, and teacher –  created assessments)  -End of term exams (Including materials from New York State Regents exams, JMap, Pearson Common Core, Houghton Mifflin  Collections, and teacher – created assessments).  -Student report card grades and transcripts  -Our school’s annual Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) scores     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    4)  Structures that we have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered include:     -Programming the appropriate minutes of discrete and integrated English as a New Language (ENL) instruction for each  individual ELL.  -Programming the ENL teacher in classes where students show a priority need for additional support (i.e. – If data trends show  students are performing below grade level or below standards in a specific content area and not in another, the ENL teacher  should prioritize instruction and allocate integrated ENL minutes to that content area.)  -Ensuring the mandates and suggestions from Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) are in place if the ELL is a Student with  Disabilities (SwD)  -Programming students for appropriate support classes (i.e. – Additional content- or skill- targeted electives for students  performing below grade-level on summative assessments; Advanced Placement (AP) classes for students performing above   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49         grade – level in specific content area exams.)  -Provide targeted formal and informal instructional and learning opportunities for students with native language support (i.e. -  Informal lunch discussions with speakers of the same languages; formal after school tutoring; shared Google Docs with  translations; peer tutoring)     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   5)  We do not service grades K - 5.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].      6) Outcome assessments data that we use to evaluate and inform our ELL programs include data from:     -NYSESLATs  -New York State Regents  -ATS Reports (RLAT, RMNR, HISE, REXH, RESI)  -ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   7) Structures that we have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to our programs include:     -Using tools to share outcome data (PupilPath/Skedula, Outlook, Google Classroom)  -Professional Developments providing instruction on how to better analyze data for adjusting programs  -Using outcome data to reprogram students (i.e. - Offering students who show English proficiency more advanced English  classes or more challenging electives; Offering students who show less proficiency more appropriate support classes; Providing  students with appropriate number of discrete and integrated ENL minutes)  -Using outcome data to program ENL to teacher to provide targeted integrated ENL support in specific content area  classrooms (i.e. - EDAT shows many ELLs are deficient in Living Environment credits, the ENL teacher should provide integrated  support in the Living Environment class that those ELLs must retake.)         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   1a)  Based on parent choice and the analysis of  data including formative, summative, and outcome data, we deliver  instruction and implement data as per CR Part 154.2 in the following ways:     -Students are provided their mandated discrete and integrated ENL minutes based on their most recent NYSESLAT  scores  -Generally, ELLs in the same grade level travel together in a block  -In core content classes, ELLs are in heterogeneous groups  -In discrete ENL classes, ELLs are in homogeneous groups      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50         b.

If applicable.      1c) Based on parent choice, we do not currently  have a DL program.   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              The mandated number of instructional minutes are provided according to proficiency levels in the program model selected by  parent choice.  According to CR Part 154.2, mandated instructional minutes are provided to each proficiency level in our  parent selected freestanding ENL program.  Our school ensures that the correct number of minutes in the correct  programming is delivered to each individual student based on his or her English language proficiency level as determined by  his or her most recent NYSESLAT score.  Our school provides targeted instruction for ELL students based on other data  gathered from 8th grade NYS exams, Achieve 3000 lexile levels, periodic assessments, NYS Regent exams, report cards,  transcripts, teacher-created classroom assessments, and classroom observations.  For example, if data and observations show  that there is a trend of ELL students struggling particularly in math, integrated ENL support will be provided in the math  classes.  If trends show that a group of 10th grade ELLs struggle with reading and writing, integrated ENL support will be  provided in the Global History classes to help better the students’ abilities for the NYS Global History Regents exam.       2a)  Explicit ENL minutes are delivered based on proficiency levels as follows:     Entering:  180 minutes of standalone ENL + 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA + 180 minutes of standalone OR integrated  ENL/ELA = 540 minutes/week  Emerging: 90 minutes of standalone ENL + 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA + 90 minutes of standalone OR integrated  ENL/ELA = 360 minutes/week  Transitional:  90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA + 90 minutes of standalone OR integrated ENL/ELA = 180 minutes/week  Expanding: 180 minutes of integrated ENL/week  Commanding:  90 minutes of integrated ENL/week     In addition to mandated ENL instructional minutes, all students including ELLs are also provided ELA instruction regularly.   ELLs  at the Entering, Emerging, and Transitional levels also receive integrated ENL support in their regularly appointed ELA  classes.          Students are provided their minimum 25%  HLA support through the use of the following:  -Translated materials (oral and written)  -The use of glossaries and dictionaries  -Access to libraries with literature and texts in native languages  -The use of technology (listening devices, translations online, media representations in native languages)  -Computer based programs with native language choices, access, and supports (Achieve3000, Khan Academy,  PupilPath/Skedula, Houghton Mifflin Collections Online Units)  -Grouping with students familiar with the same native languages for group discussions and tutoring     3.

Describe how core content is delivered in each program model.  Specify language, and the instructional approaches and  methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51         Based on parent choice, our school currently supports our ELLs through a Freestanding ENL program model.  ELLs are provided  their mandated ENL minutes based on their English language proficiency levels as determined by their most recent NYSESLAT  scores and CR - Part 154.2.  ELLs are programmed to take all content area classes (English, math, science, and social  studies).  All content area instruction is given in English.       Instructional approaches and methods are used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet  the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards.   Our school provides targeted instruction for ELLs based on data  gathered from formative and summative assessments, ATS reports, the use of EDAT, and for SWDs - information from their  IEPs.  Based on formal data trends, teacher observations,  an annual parent conferences and meetings, integrated ENL support  is provided in content areas where there is a trend of ELLs struggling in a particular content area.  For example, if data and  observations show that there is a trend of ELL students struggling particularly in math, integrated ENL support will be provided  in the math classes.  If trends show that a group of 10th grade ELLs struggle with reading and writing, integrated ENL support  will be provided in the Global History classes to help better the students’ abilities for the NYS Global History Regents exam.  In  addition to providing explicit ENL support in content area classes, based on content teachers, special education teachers, and  ENL teacher collaborations, students are provided with scaffolded lessons, modified materials, and native language support  through the use of translated materials, grouping with students who speak the same native language, and assisted  technology.  All materials are grade-level- and age- appropriate for both fostering language development and meeting the  demands of the Common Core Learning Standards.  All teachers are encouraged to plan their lessons and curriculums utilizing  the Common Core Standards, but also the Targets of Measurements (ToMs).  All teachers including core content teachers are  provided with and have access to ELL data including English proficiency levels, native language backgrounds, and student  reports such as NYS exam scores, transcripts, report cards, and IEPs.       ELL students also have access to email or a messaging system via PupilPath/Skedula to reach content area teachers for  additional questions about classes, homework, or setting up a meeting time for additional assistance.  These messaging  systems are also available in multiple languages.  ELLs also have the opportunity for informal tutoring during lunch with the  ENL teacher daily.  After-school tutoring specifically for ELLs is also provided once a week to help support core content  instruction.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      4) Based on parent choice, our school currently supports our ELLs through a Freestanding ENL program model.  ELLs are  appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year through a variety of methods.  These methods include:     -Providing grade-level- and age- appropriate materials in native languages (I.e. - a student can read Romeo and Juliet in his or  her native language and be held accountable by participating in a discussion or an activity using English;  using previous NYS  Regent exams in other languages for student practices)  -Grouping students of native languages together for discussions and activities in native languages.    -Providing access to translated materials from online programs such as Achieve3000, Khan Academy, PupilPath/Skedula, and  Houghton Mifflin Collections.    -Allowing students to respond in their native languages.    -Gathering data from their assessments and performance in the Language Other than English (LOTE) class if the language is the  same as their native language.  (For example, our school currently offers French as a foreign language course and the home  language of some of our ELLs is French.)    -Involving multilingual staff to communicate and assess ELLs in their native language abilities through oral and written  communication.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    5a)  SIFE     Students with Interrupted/Inconsistent Formal Education (SIFE), are identified at the beginning of the year and periodically  throughout the school year for midyear transfers and students new to the NYC Department of Education by reviewing ATS  data.        We conduct the SIFE Oral Interview Questionnaire, the NYS Writing Screener, and gather any educational data and information  that can be obtained about the student as a starting point to gauge instruction and supports for differentiation.     Many SIFEs have enter with very low literacy skills or possibly none at all depending on their previous experiences.  This also  means that besides not having yet acquired skills in English, they may not have literacy skills in their native language or any  other language either.  Because of low literacy skills and interrupted or inconsistent formal education, these students may also  be below grade level in core subject content.  For these students, grade-level and age-appropriate modified materials will be  provided for theses students.  [I.E. - 9th Grade ELA class is reading Romeo and Juliet, abridged copies in English and native  languages will be provided.  Student can listen to the text and/or watch a film or a film adaptation with subtitles.]  Students  will also be assigned a student mentor - with the same native language and/or cultural background if possible - to assist them  both academically and socially.  Students will also be allowed to use assistive technology in classrooms to help guide  understanding for content. [I.E. - Images and videos to better demonstrate content information.]  Because some SIFEs may not  be familiar with certain technology depending on his or her previous experiences, teachers will also be trained and encouraged  to guide the use of technology for students.       Students may have interrupted or inconsistent formal education for many reasons, and some of these reasons may result in  the need for social and psychological care.  (I.e. - Trauma from migration; the unavailability of formal education in a previous  country; living in an unsafe or a war-torn environment)  SIFEs will also be provided counseling services and encouraged to  attend tutoring activities and other extra curricular activities for social involvement.   Again, SIFEs will also be assigned a  student mentor - with the same native language and/or cultural background if possible - to assist them both academically and  socially.  Teachers will be made aware of a student’s backgrounds with consent from the student and his or her family so that  teachers can be more attuned to each student’s behaviour and needs.       5b) Newcomer     Newcomers, or those who have received less than 3 years of ENL support, are provided much support in terms of both  language support and social-cultural support.       In order to provide appropriate differentiated instruction for a newcomer, our school first assesses the student's knowledge of  his or her home language.  If the student is literate in his or her home language, the translations of texts and the use of  dictionaries and glossaries are useful to ensure that the student can continue learning content while acquiring English  language skills.  If a student is only somewhat literate or only orally and aurally fluent in his or her home language, then oral  translations of texts and information will be provided either through an interpreter, recording, or a video.  Texts will be  modified and instruction will be targeted.  For example, if the goal is for students to respond to an analytical question, the  wording in the question can be modified to eliminate words unnecessary or not as pertinent to the ability of answering a  question.  Also, depending on the ability of the newcomer, the student may be allowed to respond orally or with assistance in  writing a response.       It is also important for teachers to draw on a student’s previous knowledge and experiences - whether academic or a cultural  norm - in order to better engage a newcomer and to continue building on foundations.  Newcomer students will also be  assigned a student mentor - with the same native language and/or cultural background if possible - to assist them both  academically and socially.  In classes, students will also be grouped with students of the same native language and/or cultural  background for support.  Newcomers are also encouraged to attend small group tutoring and other extra curricular activities   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      for social involvement.     5c) Developing     Developing students, or students who have received 3+ - 6 years of ENL services, are provided differentiated instruction in  their classes in many ways.   While he or she has most likely developed some familiarity with English, a developing student may  benefit from the use of modifications to the text in English.  For example, a student could be asked to focus on specific,  highlighted paragraphs in a dense text and provided with appropriate guiding questions to check for understanding.  Students  are given graphic organizers to help keep track of usable new knowledge as refrence to better incorporate this new knowledge  into everyday practices.  For example, students can be given a range of sentence starters for different scenarios or a place to  write down vocabulary to use for different subjects and situations.  Students may also be the option to present in other  methods that are more comfortable.  For example, if a student is assigned to give a speech on a topic, the developing student  may be allowed instead to present a powerpoint with visual cues and bullet points to help clarify and direct communication.  A  student may be allowed to pre-record a speech and present the video in order to provide the developing student with a more  opportunities to rehearse and edit his or her words in a less stressful environment.       Students are also grouped with students of slightly stronger English abilities to work towards better English language  acquisition.  Depending on the needs of the student, this grouping may include other students with the same native language  and/or cultural background.       5d) Long Term     Long Term ELLs, or students who have received 6+ years of ENL services, are being prepared to continue their education  without as much structured English language support as other previous subcategories.  They are encouraged to read through  all texts without the use of translations, less use of dictionaries and glossaries, and are instead, given instruction with a focus  on using context clues.  Students are also taught by drawing connections between other disciplines and provided cross-content  application opportunities to better stimulate and advance growth and understanding.  For example, a student struggling with  explaining his or her steps in calculating a math problem can be asked to think back to the steps of writing a lab report in  science class or even how to write a recipe for cooking.  A student struggling with explaining a historical event in a social  studies essay can be asked to draw connections to the skills in retelling or summarizing a story in chronological  order.  Students are also grouped with students of stronger English abilities to work towards better English language  acquisition.       Long Term ELLs may also be asked to act as mentors to SIFEs or Newcomers to both provide knowledgeable support for those  acquiring English, and also to learn how to become more self-sufficient and an advocate for oneself while advocating for  another.       5e) Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status     Former Ells up to two years after exiting ELL status are still provided continuing support services in the form of integrated  ENL.  Our school places emphasis on providing integrated ENL services in content areas where our former ELLs show deficits or  may still foreseeably need extra support.  For example, an former ELL may still need support in writing - particularly in areas  that require extensive amounts of writing coupled with new and very specific and unfamiliar content such as US History, which  also culminates in a NYS Regents exam required for graduation.  Because of this, our school provides former ELLs with  integrated ENL support in this class.     Former ELLs may also be asked to act as mentors to SIFEs or Newcomers to both provide knowledgeable support for those  acquiring English, and also to learn how to become more self-sufficient and an advocate for oneself while advocating for  another.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?      6) Instructional strategies and grade-level materials that teachers of ELL - SWDs use that both provide access to academic  content areas and accelerated English language development include:     -Scaffolded instruction [Careful step-by-step directions; information provided in logical, chronological order, time allotted for  discussions/questions/answers]  -Side by side texts [Original - Modified/Simplified  English - Native Language]  -Blocking techniques to allow students to focus on specific areas of text  -Access to aids such as audio, visual, and realia  -Electronic communication for questions or assistance through G-Suite or PupilPath/Skedula in multiple languages  -Providing internet links to informational sources and references for homework support through G-Suite or PupilPath/Skedula  in multiple languages  -Use of other assistive technology such as approved electronic translators, cell phones, internet  -Using the TI-Nspire calculators which can connect to the SmartBoard and computer programs to better monitor students’  progress to adjust instruction  -Using the TI-Nspire calculators in multiple languages  -Targeting content and language instruction by choosing articles on programs such as Achieve3000 that highlight topics from  math, science, social studies, and ELA in multiple languages.  -Using programs like Achieve3000 or Khan Academy which adjust questioning to a level just above students’ performance  levels on different types of questions and skill sets.    -Using programs that have supplemental supports such Study Island for alternative learning opportunities and credit  accumulation  -Using programs like Houghton Mifflin Collections that provide online supplemental tools such as a section for students to  highlight and take notes electronically from the direct text in multiple languages.  -Offering multiple entrance opportunities for a student to engage in a single lesson (Written response sharing, large and small  group discussion, small group editing, individual presentations, etc.)  -Grouping homogeneously or heterogeneously based on content ability and skill levels or language abilities for different  activities.        Teachers develop these instructional strategies and discuss appropriate grade - level materials for ELL - SWDs through  collaborative planning between Integrated Co - Teacher planning time, annual IEP meetings, IEP revision meetings, triennial IEP  meetings, meetings and discussions with the student's IEP case manager, meetings with the student’s counselor(s), meetings  with the student's related service provider(s) (if applicable), and Student Implementation Team (SIT) meetings.  Many of our  school’s ELL population are also SWDs, and therefore the ENL teacher is always involved in all meetings pertaining to the ELL  student’s IEP and learning needs.  Information is communicated through face-to-face meetings, phone conversations, emails,  and interactions on live documents such as IEPs on SESIS.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?     7) Our school uses curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL - SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and attain  English proficiency within the least restrictive environment in the following ways:     -Providing Integrated Co-Teaching (ICT) in all core content settings for SWDs  -Grouping homogeneously or heterogeneously based on content ability and skill levels or language abilities for different  activities.  -Allowing flexibility in student presentation [I.e. - Turning in an assignment electronically or by hand; allowing the use of  technology for assignments; Accepting oral or written responses for different assignments]   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      -Allowing extended time for certain assignments  -Providing daily early morning resource room before 1st period  -Providing daily informal tutoring at lunchtime  -Providing scheduled after school tutoring for different subject areas  -Offering students who are below grade level in reading or struggle with specific reading and/or writing tasks Achieve3000  classes and access  -Offering students alternative learning opportunities such as Study Island a chance to learn and accumulate credit  -Providing mandated testing modifications for ELLs  including the use of approved translated exams, glossaries, and extended  time and whatever the student’s IEP states [I.e. - Separate location, preferential seating, on task prompting, use of a scribe,  allowable breaks, use of assisted technology]  -Utilizing G-Suite and Pupil/Path Skedula to communicate anecdotes and observations of student performance and behavior     Teachers, administration, counselors, psychologists, and programmers develop these curricular, instructional,. and scheduling  strategies for ELL - SWDs through collaborative planning between Integrated Co - Teacher planning time, annual IEP meetings,  IEP revision meetings, triennial IEP meetings, meetings and discussions with the student's IEP case manager, meetings with the  student’s counselor(s), meetings with the student's related service provider(s) (if applicable), and Student Implementation  Team (SIT) meetings. The ENL teacher is always involved in all meetings pertaining to the ELL student’s IEP and learning  needs.  Information is communicated through face-to-face meetings, phone conversations, emails, and interactions on live  documents such as IEPs on SESIS.          8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.     8) Targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas are created based on baseline,  formative, and summative data.  This data is collected through ATS reports (RESI) and the use of the ELL Data Analysis Tool  (EDAT).     Intervention programs are created and implemented for different subgroups.       -Achieve3000  [Entering, Emerging, and Transitioning students for ELA (reading and writing) support - can be used in English and/or other  languages;  9th grade ELL - SWDs scoring 1-2.5 on 8th Grade ELA exam; All ELLs who perform below standards on reading  comprehension, analytical, and short responses on science and social studies exams - articles with science and social studies  content will be selected for practice use]     -Study Island  [Long Term and Former ELLs  in math who need to earn credit and pass a math regents exam; predominantly upper classmen  scoring below 65 on previous math regents]     -Khan Academy  [Additional math homework tutorials for all Entering, Emerging, and Transitioning students (available in other languages]     -Resource Room  [Early morning open class for ELL - SWDs to come for extra tutoring for student selected topics and assignments.]     -ELL Tutoring [Informal]  [All ELLs are welcome, but this is specifically an opportunity for SIFEs and Newcomers to meet with Long Term and Former ELL  mentors to interact socially and receive monitored academic assistance during the students’ lunchtime.]      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      -ELL Tutoring [Formal]  [All ELLs are welcome, but this is specifically an open opportunity for students to receive assistance through the use of  technology in the computer lab and one-on-one assistance from the ENL teacher in student selected topics and assignments.]     -Integrated ENL Programming  [This is created and implemented based on baseline, summative, and formative data from the previous semester.  Targeted  support is provided in content areas where there is a trend of ELLs struggling in a particular content area.  For example, if data  and observations show that there is a trend of ELL students struggling particularly in math, integrated ENL support will be  provided in the math classes.  If trends show that a group of 10th grade ELLs struggle with reading and writing, integrated ENL  support will be provided in the Global History classes to help better the students’ abilities for the NYS Global History Regents  exam.]     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      9)  Based on data and trends, the following new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year:     -Programming an extra period of math for subgroups of students with below satisfactory math grades and scores on math  regent  -Offering a day of ENL tutoring dedicated to writing skills specific to taking Social Studies Regents  -Hosting more ENL mentor/mentee events and opportunities  -Offering more professional learning opportunities for all staff on differentiating for ELLs and ELL - SWDs     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   10) Based on parent choice, we do not have a bilingual program this year.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  11)  ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs.  After school and supplemental services are offered to ELLs in our  building include:     -ELL Tutoring (Hosted by the ENL teacher)  -Subject area tutoring (Hosted by the subject area teacher with modifications and support discussed with the ENL teacher  during Common Planning Time, meetings, emails, and other forms of communication.)    -Regents tutoring (Hosted by the subject area teacher with modifications and support discussed with the ENL teacher during  Common Planning Time, meetings, emails, and other forms of communication.)    -Visiting Chef’s Program (Professional chefs from a variety of different cultural and language backgrounds visit the school  weekly to teach students about cooking from their personal cultures and experiences.)  -Campus-wide sports (Integration of all small schools on campus - including bilingual, dual language programs, and free  standing ENL programs - to interact in intramural, junior varsity, and varsity sports teams.)  -Counseling services (mandated and upon request) offered in English and other languages.     ELLs and their families are notified of school programs offered through:     -Email blasts and notifications through PupilPath/Skedula  written in English and in the language of student choice and to the  families in the written language of parent(s) choice  -Newsletters and notifications mailed through USPS written in English and in the language of parent choice  -Newsletters and notifications given to students written in English and in the language of parent choice  -Phone calls home in English and the language of parent choice  -The work of our bilingual Parent-Coordinator  -The assistance of multilingual staff members  -The use of the Language and Translation Unit     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  12)  Instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs across all content areas.  These include access to  the following:  -Internet  -Computer Lab  -Laptop Carts [Lenovo; Chromebooks]  -SmartBoards  -Promethean Boards  -TI-82, 83, and Nspired calculators [Nspired calculators can be programmed into multiple languages] for all math classes  -G-Suite [Students each have their school-based Google email and use this platform for assignments across all content areas;  G-Suite can be accessed in multiple languages]  -Online academic programs in multiple languages for math, English, Science, and Social Studies [Achieve3000, Khan Academy,  Study Island, Houghton Mifflin Collections]  -Voice Recognition devices - computers, cell phones, tablets - to assist with transfers of oral langauge to written language  -Copies of previous Regents exams in English and other languages available online  -Communication programs in multiple languages [PupilPath/Skedula, Gmail, the use of the Translation and Interpretation Unit]     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?      13) Based on parent choice and the analysis of  data including formative, summative, and outcome data, we deliver instruction  and implement data as per CR Part 154.2 in the following ways:     -Students are provided their mandated discrete and integrated ENL minutes based on their most recent NYSESLAT scores  -Generally, ELLs in the same grade level travel together in a block  -In core content classes, ELLs are in heterogeneous groups  -In discrete ENL classes, ELLs are in homogeneous groups     Based on parent choice, we do not currently have a TBE program.  Based on parent choice, we do not currently  have a DL program.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.        14) Our school ensures that all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels by providing  age-appropriate high-, mid-, and lower- level readers for our students.   These readers correspond to appropriate content area  topics and Common Core Standards.  These materials are decided with the input of teachers, administration, and guidance. For  example, in an ELA class, students may have a thematic topic targeting certain Common Core Learning Standards.  The  students are divided into literature circle groups based on lexile scores determined from Achieve3000 and other summative  assessments.  From there, the grouped students are asked to choose a group novel from a certain collection of novels that  correspond to lexile levels just above the students’ levels.  These are novels approved by New York State TextBook Law (NYSTL)  which come with marked reading levels.       Content area, ENL, and Special Education teachers also utilize common planning time to adjust materials accordingly for each  content area for each grade level.  For example, if an 12th grade Expanding ELL is struggling with understanding the way the US  election process works in his or her US Government class, teachers can plan different ways to help the student better  understand.  Teachers can access articles of the same topic written with less political and formal jargon, modify the structure  of the writing into bullet points or a flow chart, or access a video with subtitles that explains the process in English and/or the  student’s native language.  The teachers could then utilize questioning and discussion and/or written responses to check for  student understanding.  This planning could also be done through emails and online interactions.     Appropriate grouping is also used to ensure that ELLs are working with their grade - level peers on content area.  Former ELLs  who have stronger English proficiency can be grouped with ELLs who are less proficient.  Former ELLs are great mentors and  advocates for current ELLs because they understand the patience and process taken to acquire content knowledge in a new  language and they themselves are immersed in the same studies.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    15)  Our school shares a building (collocation).  This takes a strong building-wide effort to program shared spaces such as the  student-scanning at the entrance, gymnasium, library, cafeteria, nurse’s office, and auditorium accordingly.  We coordinate the  following efforts to ensure that all of the ELLs needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met:     -Posted signs provided by the Translation and Interpretation Unit to help indicate what language is needed in areas where  people frequently seek assistance (medical office, main offices, guidance offices, main entrance and scanning)  Bilingual and culturally sensitive male and female staff at entrance to handle ID swiping and student-scanning (Parent- Coordinator, Security Agents, Administration, School Aides)  -Bilingual and culturally sensitive male and female staff in shared spaces like the gymnasium/locker rooms, cafeteria, and  auditorium  -Library space with texts in English and other languages  -Signs posted for events and services in multiple languages  -Bilingual building-wide relationship counselor  -Bilingual school psychology staff  -Bilingual condom availability staff     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).      16)  Activities that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year include:     -Initial meeting with bilingual parent-coordinator or bilingual staff  and the ENL teacher to establish knowledge of an adult of  the same home language or someone who is aware of the student’s home language need  -Initial meeting with a bilingual counselor or a counselor and and a translator to provide basic orientation for programs and  assistance.  -Providing scheduled check-ins with bilingual guidance counselors and parent-coordinator the first few weeks  -Open houses with bilingual staff available for guidance (Parent-Coordinator, Counselors, Teachers, School Aides)  -Open houses with Student Government, National Honor Society, and upperclassmen mentors who are current and/or former  ELLs of different language and cultural backgrounds  -Summer orientation with oral translators and written translated materials     Activities that assist new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year include:     -Initial meeting with bilingual parent-coordinator or bilingual staff  and the ENL teacher to establish knowledge of an adult of  the same home language or someone who is aware of the student’s home language need  -Initial meeting with a bilingual counselor or a counselor and and a translator to provide basic orientation for programs and  assistance.  -Providing scheduled check-ins with bilingual guidance counselors and parent-coordinator the first few weeks  -Introducing new ELLs to the ELL lunch tutoring group (facilitated by the ENL teacher)  -Assigning older ELLs to provide a tour of the school facilities  -Assigning a grade-level ELL to act as a guide and an advocate for the new student in classes  -Introducing the new ELL to other students of his or her native language and/or cultural background if available  -Inviting new ELL to join after-school activities where other ELLs are directly involved such as ELL tutoring, Multicultural Visiting  Chef’s program, athletics, music clubs, drama club, and Student Government  -Integration into the annual ELL cultural holiday party        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59         17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    17)  At the moment, our only language electives offered to all students, including ELLs, is French.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)?

How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   18)  Based on parent choice, we do not currently offer a dual language program.     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?     1) All staff, including all teachers of ELL and non-pedagogic staff, receive Professional Development (PD) and support in regards  to educating and working with ELLs.     Staff receive their contractual professional development minutes each week and this time is used to develop plans to better  educate and support all students, including ELLs.  Sometimes, these PDs are led by the ENL teacher who may introduce topics  targeting specific aspects of our ELL population, and sometimes these school PDs are turnkeys of information gathered from  outside PDs.  Sometimes these topics are led by administration and other staff.  The topics are often chosen based on data  gathered from baseline, summative, and formative assessments and other data tools such as ATS and EDAT.  Often when  trying to target our “lowest third”, this grouping includes many of our ELLs and our ELL - SWDs.  From this, we develop PDs  centered targeted around Common Core Learning Standards that these groups struggle with such as “Analyzing complex  primary sources...” or “Evaluating authors’ differing points of view…”     Each year, the ENL teacher and a school counselor who are the school’s Language Access Coordinators (LACs) also attend an  annual training hosted by the Field Language Access Coordinator, and turnkeys this information to the rest of school staff  including teachers and non-pedagogic staff.  The information from these trainings help our entire school community better  understand the importance of the needs of our ELLs and their families.       Planning and supporting ELLs specifically includes taking knowledge from the PD topic and working in co-teaching teams  including a content area teacher, a special education teacher, and an ENL teacher.  This team will take the knowledge from the  PD and use their own content specialty backgrounds to best develop practices and supports for ELLs.       These co-teaching teams may often attend other professional developments together to continuously develop as a team of  professionals.   A few PLO attended by teacher teams specific to planning and supporting ELLS include, but are not limited to:       -NYC Department of ELL and Student Support PLO:  Algebra - A Gateway to STEM series (Math and ENL teachers)  -Brooklyn Historical Society:  Women’s and Gender History PLO (Social Studies, Special Education, and ENL teachers)  -NYSESLAT Training (Math, Special Education, and ENL teachers)  -NYC Department of ELL and Student Support PLO: Developing Academic Literacy - Delving Deeper into Argumentation and  Academic Conversations (Social Studies, Special Education, and ENL teachers)     The professional development plan for teachers of ELLs including the ENL teacher in supporting ELLs as they engage in the  Common Core Learning Standards includes participation in many Professional Learning Opportunities (PLO) and Professional   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         Learning Communities (PLC) such as:     -Manhattan Field Support Center (MFSC) PLO:  ELL Leads Meeting Series  -MFSC Professional Learning Community PLC: Preparing ELLs for the English Regents Exam Series  -MFSC Professional Learning Expo  -NYC Department of ELL and Student Support PLO:  Algebra - A Gateway to STEM series  -NYS/NYC Regional Bilingual Education Resource Network (RBERN)  -NYS ELL Student and Family PLOs hosted by Fordham University  -NYS ELL Student and Family PLOs hosted by New York University       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  2)  Or school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2 including the 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of all hours for the ENL teachers receiving ELL-specific professional development.  Records are kept though  agendas distributed at the beginning of each PD held in school as well as shared through Google Docs.  Attendance sheets are  signed at the beginning of each PD and kept by the school administration.  Teachers are also encouraged to document their  own PD hours, especially to maintain their licenses and earn their Continuing Teacher and Leader Education (CTLE) hours.       These PD requirements are met through a combination of PDs developed by school staff including all teachers of ELLs and non- pedagogic and other PLOs and PLCs outside of the school.  Staff is continuously encouraged to seek outside learning  opportunities independently and as co-teaching teams.  PDs are found through a variety of email subscription newsletters,  including ones from the NYC Department of ELL and Student Support (DELLS) and the DELLS intranet page.         Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?      1) The school provides annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language development  progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas.  This annual  individual meeting is outside of mandated parent orientations, IEP meetings and reviews, and DOE - scheduled parent  conferences.  This meeting is a small meeting between the ENL teacher and the family of the ELL student.  During this meeting,  the group discusses the development of an ELL’s language skills based on a combination of data including classroom  assessments and anecdotal evidence and baseline, summative, and formative assessments.  Scores such as periodic lexile  assessments, BoY and EoY exams, regents scores, and NYSESLAT scores are discussed.  Classroom performance and grades will  also be provided through teacher notes and grade books and an examination of student work across all content areas.     This annual individual meeting with parents of ELLs is made accessible to the families by being knowledgeable of their oral and  written language preferences through ATS data and general knowledge of our ELL family community.  If the family uses a home  language of someone on staff, we will have that person on staff translate and interpret.  If not, we will utilize the services of  the Translation and Interpretation Unit by having written documents translated ahead of time, and calling for an over the  phone interpreter.        2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   2) Parents of ELLs are invited and welcomed at all school-wide events, and translations and interpreters will be provided  through our multilingual school staff or the use of the Translation and Interpretation Unit.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61         Activities specific to fostering parental involvement for parents of ELLs include:     -Annual ELL Holiday Party  -Updated Informational Board [Information providing information for Adult ESL classes, ESL Writing Seminars, ELL-targeted SAT  classes, and ELL student and family activities during weekends, holidays, and summer]  -ELL Family Cookbook     Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Roger E. Turgeon, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Food and Finance High School                                                                              School DBN: 288  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      1) The data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written  and oral communication include pertinent information culled from the following:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) - This is the initial step in identifying what   language the student’s family would like to receive written information which may or may not be the  same as the language in which the student’s family would like to receive oral communication. This survey  is filled out together by the family and the appropriately trained pedagogue.     ATS reports - ATS reports used to assess language preferences of the student include the Parent’s   Preferred Language Report (RTL) which lists all languages including English, represented in our school  community. The Adult Preferred Language Report (RAPL) is used to find out school’s language access   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65            demographic and lists the preferred written and oral language for all adults on the student's emergency  contact lists, and the Parent’s Preferred Language Report (RCPL) gives a composite number of parents  who speak a certain language, the percent written and the percent oral.   Student Emergency Contact Cards - This must be presented to the parents in a language of choice and  they must be marked with the language(s) in which the parents prefer information. [I.e. - In the event of  an emergency, the parent(s) needs to be contacted by a speaker of the requested home language.]   Surveys conducted by your school - For better communication, surveys should be sent out asking families  which methods of communication is best [I.e. - Phone, Email, Fax, Website, Printed Notification via  Student, Printed Notification via USPS, Face-to-Face meeting, etc.] These surveys should also ask in which  language(s) families would prefer the different types of communication. [I.e. - A family might want oral  communications over the phone in a native language other than English but written communications of  notifications mailed home in English.]          2.
