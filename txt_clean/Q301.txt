This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The Academy for Careers in Television and Film (TvF), which opened its doors to its first freshman cohort in  September 2008, serves grades 9 through 12, and uniquely provides its students with a high quality college prep  education as well as meaningful entry points into a range of career paths, including a variety of “below-the-line”  television and film production positions almost entirely neglected by existing high school programs. The membership  of NYPA, the school’s lead partner, represents a cross section of the industry and includes the owners of New York’s  major studios, top producers and directors, unions, and scores of other businesses and organizations. Through this   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      and many other industry partnerships, students benefit from unprecedented opportunities to work alongside industry  professionals and gain valuable experience to support their career and academic aspirations.                     2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    The Academy for Careers in Television and Film (TvF) is an unscreened Career and Technical Education high school  serving students in 9 - 14. It exists to provide a bridge to higher education and meaningful preparation for careers in  video production. TvF students are enrolled in a sequence of introductory CTE courses which provide them with an  understanding of the history and structure of the film and television industry, and the nature of different career paths  in production. By the 11th grade students select an area of specialization, entering a sequence of advanced courses,  and are often placed in internships. The school’s lead partner, the New York Production Alliance, represents a cross  section of the industry and includes the owners of New York’s major studios, top producers and directors, unions, and  scores of other businesses and organizations. Through this and many other industry partnerships, students benefit  from unprecedented opportunities to work alongside industry professionals and gain valuable experience to support  their career and academic aspirations. Simultaneous to learning skills that are applicable to the workforce, students  also participate in a customized college preparatory academic program and receive highly personalized instruction.  The academic courses at TvF are organized around the knowledge, skills, and work habits which students will need to  be successful in competitive four-year universities. A particular emphasis is placed on the mastery of written and  verbal communication skills. Recognizing how important it is that students be provided with the opportunity to  engage in advanced coursework and to earn college credits prior to graduation, TvF offers a range of AP and other  college-credit bearing courses and post-secondary partnerships. This year, TvF is part of two initiatives: the PROSE  Program and the Learning Partners New Teacher Preparation Partnership Program. The former would allow us the  flexibility to continue our non-traditional organizational practices and the latter would give us the opportunity to act  as a mentor around our work and experience in developing and supporting resident teachers with partner schools  that are in their first year of hosting teacher residents in their school.       TvF is part of the New Visions for Public Schools affinity group and effectively utilizes its’ services in leadership  coaching, teacher professional development, data analysis, and operational guidance. The combination of New  Visions’ support along with our own internal systems, instructional practices, and organizational decision-making has  resulted in great accomplishments. Since graduating our first cohort in 2012, TvF has maintained a graduation rate of  96% or higher and an attendance rate of 93% or higher. Similar to previous years, in the 2017-18 school year 98% of  students in 9th and 10th grade earned enough credits to be on track for high school graduation, 43% of students  graduated college ready, and 76% of graduates enrolled in a college or other postsecondary program within 6 months  of graduation. These results are some of our school’s greatest achievements; likewise, maintaining these high rates of  success continues to be our greatest challenge from year to year.        3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Of our 558 enrolled students, 128 are students with disabilities and 11 are ELLs who receive various services. Over  their four years with us, these students excel in our close knit, supportive environment as is demonstrated with our  100% graduation rate for both our SPED and ELL students in 2018. We have been able to meet and exceed their needs  through the differentiated instruction provided by our teachers, the supportive environment provided by the advisory  program, and the extensive additional support provided through our after school tutoring program.            4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   During the 2017-2018 school year we continued to refine and deepening our structures and systems that foster  teacher collaboration, a supportive school environment, and rigorous instruction. We made the most progress  related to the Framework for Great Schools in the area of Supportive Environment. All of our advisories from 9-12  grade implemented the CARA Curriculum (College Access: Research and Action). We deepened this curricular  initiative with two successful planning retreats where the faculty refined our four year scope and sequence  supported by the CARA coach and our own college office. Advisory teams then met monthly to review their  progress, make adjustments to pacing, if need be, and plan for upcoming lessons. Over the course of the year, we  have seen substantial gains in college planning awareness and understanding in all of our students, as well as our  faculty. At the end of the 2017-2018 year, we also introduced motivational interviewing, supported by the CARA  coach and our social work department, to begin to address the social-emotional aspect of college and career  readiness. This will continue to be a focus for he 2018-2019 school year.      Additionally, during the 2018-2019 school year, we will continue to focus on strengthening our mastery based  grading system. During the 2017-2018 school year, we adopted and implemented a four-tier mastery system. Our  mastery team collaborated on developing, sharing, and then implementing a school-wide four tier system that  begins at 'missing mastery' and leads to 'advance mastery'. This transition has been well received by faculty,  students, and families.

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.        Starting in the Fall of 2012, TvF transitioned into a system of Mastery Based Courses in an effort to solidify the  relationship among course grades, credits awarded and what students are actually accountable for mastering in  terms of content and skills in their classes. The rationale behind the system is based on the idea that for students to  earn course credit they must demonstrate mastery in every unit of study or essential skill/content identified in the  curriculum map. While courses are all, by default, designed for mastery to be demonstrated in one semester, not  all students are able to do so and some require more time and/or more individualized support. In these cases, the  mastery based system allows teachers to identify the specific units, content and skills that individual students are  deficient in and target further instruction to address their needs. The ultimate goal is for students, after taking  advantage of the extra targeted instruction, to be given the opportunity to demonstrate mastery of the deficient  content skills via a Mastery Based Assessment (MBA). In the Spring of 2018, we expanded our mastery system to  reflect a four-tier continuum of mastery-based standards. The goal is to provide students, teachers, advisors, and  families a more detailed understanding of how students are performing academically and to provide greater  guidance on how students can progress to the next academic level. Below are the details on this four-tier system,  as well as how the levels will be presented in gradebooks.       L4 - Advancing in Mastery - Student has demonstrated an advancing understanding of the content or the use of a  skill.    L3 - Meeting Mastery - Student has demonstrated a basic understanding of the content or the use of the skill.  Student must meet this benchmark to be considered passing the assessment or task. While opportunities vary  across classes, students are encouraged to take advantage of tutoring and other resources to achieve Advancing  Mastery.    L2 - Approaching Mastery - Student has demonstrated limited understanding of the content or the use of a skill.  Students receiving an Approaching Mastery benchmark will not be considered passing the assessment or task.  Students will have to engage in tutoring and remediation to achieve Meeting Mastery.    L1 - Missing Mastery - Student has demonstrated no understanding of the content or skill or has missed the  assessment or task outright. Students receiving a Missing Mastery benchmark will not be considered passing the  assessment or task. Students will have to engage in tutoring and remediation to achieve Meeting Mastery.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13      During the 2018 - 2019, we we will continue to develop and refine this four-tier system across all content areas.  Each department will continue to identify and define specific mastery targets for all courses and develop specific  interventions to ensure all student are meeting mastery targets. Additionally, departments will communicate these  mastery targets on our new online grading system, Jumprope.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.      By June 2019, 100% of departments will have identified and articulated criteria on a four-tier continuum for each  mastery targets for their courses and developed specific lesson and interventions to ensure all students are able to  meet the mastery targets.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  In order to foster the development of meaningful relationships which support student success, every TvF student  belongs to an advisory of about 15 students. In addition to providing a forum for positive peer group recognition,  supporting the social and emotional development of students, and building a sense of community, advisors  advocate for their students at TvF and beyond, including the college application and enrollment process in  conjunction with our college office. As the point person, the advisor communicates regularly with parents to  coordinate efforts between the school and home to support academic success. Advisors also facilitate Parent  Teacher Conferences with the parents and students four times a year, at the middle and end of both semesters.  They also lead individualized “advisory conferences” with each of their advisees to monitor the student’s progress  and plans for next steps. During PTC and advisory conferences, advisors specifically review topics such as  attendance and lateness, grades, missing homework, behavioral issues (class removals), tutoring schedules,  Regents and SAT scores, and their progress in the college applications process. As we enter our tenth year, the  advisor-advisee culture is well-established; but there is a need to further strengthen the protocols and expectations  around the advisory program, particularly around college planning and support. During the 2016-2017 academic  year we began a partnership with CARA (College Access: Research and Action). The CARA program provided our  advisors training and coaching on supporting students and families throughout the college process as well as a  robust college planning curriculum that was initially rolled out and implemented across grades 9-12. In addition to  curriculum and coaching for our advisors, CARA supports the College Bridge program, which employs two of our  alumni to support seniors in the college application and enrollment process. This includes targeted support  throughout the school and over the summer as graduates begin the enrollment process in their post secondary  institution. During the September 2017 and January 2018 Advisory planning retreats, advisors identified the needs  to cultivate resilience in students and promote ownership of the college process. They stated that they needed  further training and coaching around supporting students and their families with the emotional challenges that  arise when considering postsecondary plans. For the 2018-201 school year, we will focus on deepening this work  with the CARA partnership with explicit focus on developing a social emotional learning component through the  use of motivational interviewing.              Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment.

Strategies to address the needs of students with  disabilities, English language learners, and other high- need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited,  SIFE, STH).      Dedicate a professional development series (of at least 2  sessions) to motivational interviewing as a strategy for providing  additional socio-emotional support within Advisory for all  students, including SWD and ENLs.      Advisors receive support from CARA coach around implementing  motivational interviewing and dealing with common challenges  that arise.   Advisors identify 2-3 at-risk students for implementing socio- emotional supports and providing interventions, including SWD  and ENLs.      Advisors, administrators, social workers, and parents conduct in- person meetings to discuss progress and stage interventions.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.

Some of the key features highlighted as areas of strength on our last quality review (Fall 2015) reveal the direct  payoffs of TvF’s culture and track record around teacher collaboration including:      Across a vast majority of classrooms, instructional practices reflect a unified set of beliefs that deeply  engage all students in challenging tasks and opportunities to produce meaningful work products and  ownership of their learning. (1.2)      The school’s assessment practices are thoughtfully aligned to curricula and standards, and result in   effective instructional adjustments affording a clear portrait of student mastery and student awareness of  their next learning steps. (2.2)      The school engages in structured professional collaborations on teams using an inquiry approach that   promotes shared leadership and focuses on improved student learning. (4.2)       Additionally, when looking at patterns of credit accumulation, Regents passing and mastery rates (Progress Report  and School Quality Guides from 2012-2017), TvF has been able to maintain and consistently increase metrics that  are remarkably high when compared to similar schools and even at large across the city. The consistency across  staff responsible for the same course/subject areas also is evidence of the fruits of a strong collaborative culture.    Last year, we continued to build on the success of our intervisitation program. After hearing from many teachers  that they wanted to transition from heterogeneous teams to departmental teams, we organized our intervisitation  cycle within departments. In these departmental teams we continued to support teacher collaboration by  developing tools to assist teacher teams in scheduling time to observe one another’s classroom, tools to capture  data during the observation, and protocols and professional development time to effectively debrief the  intervisitation and share feedback between peers. Additionally, a team of English and Social Studies teachers  further developed an inquiry process of looking at student work related to argumentative writing, and developed  and refined a protocol and rubric to look at student writing.       For the 2018-2019 school year, we want to continue to deepen this work by focusing the teacher-led intervisitation  that allows departments to collaborative plan, teach, observe, and debrief lessons focused on departmental goals.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41              Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.      TvF has an established culture of transparency and professional collaboration where teachers play a key role in the  school’s successes well beyond their specific classroom and instructional responsibilities. On the last Quality  Review (Fall 2015) our area of celebration was “ The leadership and faculty convey high expectations that reinforce  the school’s positive culture and link college and career readiness with successfully partnering with families to  support student progress toward achieving expectations. Teacher teams and staff established a culture for learning  that systematically communicates a unified set of high expectations for all students. (3.4)”, which to a great extent  we attribute to a leadership approach that is distributive, purposeful and systematically organized around  collaboratively identified school priorities. This year TvF is again part of the PROSE initiative, allowing us to  implement non-traditional programming that ensures expansive opportunities for teacher common planning time  as well as significantly extended professional development sessions of 1 hour and 45 minutes every Wednesday.      Teachers play a key role in identifying the priority pieces that determine how the weekly PD time is allocated. In  order to provide for the maintenance and growth of effective practices, effective implementation of new  initiatives, and authentic teacher participation in their own the school’s development, TvF established a  Coordinating Committee (CC). This body serves as the vehicle for leadership distribution and clear communication  channels between faculty and administration. CC meets weekly and includes representatives from each major  academic department, administration, social work, and the school’s business manager. Members of this committee  are lead facilitators of grade team, advisory team, and department team meetings. This structure of distributed  leadership has proved critical for maintaining the high levels of efficiency and transparency that is embedded in  TvF’s culture.       The work described above is systemic in nature with the main goal of establishing an effective infrastructure to  address the inherent challenges of being a non-selective urban school that strives to offer a comparable  educational experience (CTE program included) to any of the city’s most selective programs. This approach has  been essential to establishing TvF’s basic structures and working philosophy over our first 8 years, including what  we have achieved in terms of student outcomes:   ● Graduation rate - over 95% for first four cohorts and at least 98% for three most recent cohorts.   ● Regents performance - first attempt pass rates above 80% across all mandatory exams    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      ● AP and College Now - increased participation with 25% of the current juniors projected to graduate having taken  at least 2 AP and 2 College Now courses, and 40% with at least one of each.    ● CTE - increase in CTE endorsements from 86% in first cohort to 93% in the 2nd; with 100% CTE endorsements in  the last two cohorts and an increase in graduates getting union and other professional level work from 1st to 2nd  cohort, alongside their increased participation as school-based teaching assistant interns in current core production  courses.    Additionally, in terms of leadership development, the current school’s administration is made up of members of  the founding teams elevated into their current positions over the years and four other staff members over the  years have enrolled in school leadership programs and expanded their roles as teacher leaders in the school.  Additionally, during the 2017-2018 school year, one faculty member participated in the LEAP program.       The Coordinating Committee has been established for 9 years. In this time, there has been an increase in number  of teacher teams, along with more autonomy of practice and added responsibility for teams and facilitators. We  have currently identified our priority need as looking closely at best practices and protocols within specific teams to  document and systematize them, in order to increase efficiency, make the work less idiosyncratic and less  dependent on individual facilitators or team membership.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.     By June 2019, three members of CC will collectively write and revise the SOPM that articulates specific   protocols, like curriculum development, instructional support, identification of at risk students, and student  interventions, to support annually recurring initiatives that are fundamental to the school’s functioning. This  will result in 100% of team leaders utilizing the SOMP resources to manage and facilitate team meetings. As a  result of the utilization of the SOMP, we expect to see the following from each team; advisory teams, 100%  alignment of advisory curriculum implementation, department and grade teams, 5% increase of MBA  completion within first two months after initial course.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.  Strategies to address the needs of students with  disabilities, English language learners, and other high- need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited,  SIFE, STH).   CC meets weekly to prepare full staff PD sessions and review  operational tasks team facilitators will be responsible for leading  in the teams. In addition to facilitating teacher team meetings,  including all departments, SPED, and ENL, CC (lead teacher)  members are also responsible for collecting ongoing feedback  from the rest of the faculty (both during meeting time and  informally) about specific areas of need, interest, concerns or  questions so that they can be addressed appropriately.   CC meetings dedicate the first portion of the agenda to debrief  and document how the previous staff meeting(s) went,  identifying what worked well, what didn’t, outstanding questions  and possible steps moving forward.   All plans and “post-meeting” feedback is aggregated in a CC  Meeting Minutes document that serves as a guide to all the  major tasks, initiatives, inquiries and issues the school has  addressed throughout the year.

At TvF we are thoroughly committed to engaging our parents as key stakeholders in our school community and  involving them as much as possible in their child’s education. Before students begin their academic studies at our  school, students and families are required to attend one of our open house events so that they fully understand our  program and see how it will meet their needs and help them realize their aspirations. Families are also invited to  attend a pivotal meet and greet session at the start of the 9th grade school year while their students attend our  Summer Bridge Program so they can be informed about the upcoming school year, connect with their child’s  advisor and our parent coordinator, and enroll in Edline (the school-to-home communication system which allows  them 24/7 access to their students grades and important school announcements.) Over the course of the school  year and the student's academic career at TvF, parents are: encouraged to participate in monthly Parent-Teacher  Association meetings, communicated with on a regular basis via the advisor of the student about their personal  and academic development, participate in 4, pre-scheduled parent-teacher conferences with the advisor where  student, parents, and the advisor review the student's academic progress and collaboratively develop next steps.  Families are also invited to two awards ceremonies, celebrating student academic achievement.      Additionally, during the 2017-2018, we hosted our fourth annual student film festival in partnership with the PTA,  the CTE department, and the community CTE partners we work with. For the year ahead, we plan on continuing to  strengthen our strong family ties by hosting a fourth annual student film festival with the Parent Teacher  Association.           Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and  Time-bound.      By June 2019, in order to increase parents awareness and engagement in school-wide programs, like PTA meetings and  input opportunities related to the school's curriculum, internship program and extracurricular activities, more parents  will be informed about our film festival through email messages, backpack fliers, and messages home from advisors, as  evidenced by the increase in at least 100 families attending the spring festival.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          89     State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          90           Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          91      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Academy for Careers in Television and Film, in compliance with the Section  1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent  involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the  families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision- making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School  Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of  the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   Academy for Careers in Television and Film will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          92      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          93      ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  We use a range of diagnostic tools to assess the literacy skills of our students in both English and their native language. At the  core of these assessments are reading inventories (we use both the Analytical Reading Inventory as well as the Qualitative  Reading Inventory). In addition, we use leveled native language texts along with Teachers’ Colleges’ procedures for creating  running records. To assess students writing abilities, we ask students to create an on demand piece of writing from which we  derive quantitative data on the frequency of errors and qualitative description of the key organizational, developmental and  grammatical characteristics. The date shows that 100% of students need help increasing their vocabulary skills in order to  bolster their overall literacy skills. This informs the instructional plan as teachers provide supports for those students struggling  with literacy skills by using leveled texts and supporting vocabulary acquisition.        2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Weekly teacher team meetings and common planning time for teachers to analyze assessment data and develop next steps.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          100         3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We evaluate the success of our ELL program by looking at:      a) the number of students who successfully pass Regents exams and NYSESLAT exam      b) the number of students who are on track in the accumulation of credits      c) the number of students meeting standards in our CTE programs      d) the extent to which ELLs participate in the full range of activities offered to our student body.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Weekly teacher team meetings and common planning time for teachers to analyze assessment data and develop next steps.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   NA     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Over the past three years, we have seen between 20%-30% of our ELLs demonstrate proficiency on the   NYSELAT.  Additionally, each year at least another 80% of ELLs score in the Advance range.  It is clear that our combination of  integrated settings, individualized ELL support, our advisory program, and our CTE program are allowing our students to make  quick and substantial gains in the English language development. Typically our ELLs perform well in the Listening and Speaking  components of the NYSESLAT, often reaching proficiency while continuing to need support in the Reading and Writing  components. Our Reading and Writing supports have moved students previously at the Intermediate level to the Advanced  level within one school year.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Again, our teaching teaming structures of grade teams, department teams, and advisory teams provide teachers  opportunities to discuss student progress and necessary supports.  Additionally, our robust in house data and assessment  tracking system allows all teachers real time access to current student performance levels.             Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   As defined by Section 154-2.2(m), shall mean a unit of study or its equivalent in which students receive core content  area (English language arts, math, science or social studies) and English language development instruction.  In an  Integrated ENL setting, instruction can be provided by one dually certified ESOL teacher with common branch or  content-area teacher certification, or provided by two individually certified teachers, who collaborate to plan and  deliver instruction and assessment through a co-teaching model.  Thus, co-teaching is not synonymous with push-in  service in a general education classroom. Freestanding or standalone ENL program was checked above since  integrated was not an option above. Our program provides an integrated program. This is because we only have nine  students labeled ELL. Our program consists of instruction composed of two components: a language arts instructional  component and a content area instructional component. Such instruction takes into account the first language and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          101         culture of such students. We take into account the ELA and ESL standards for language arts and the content area  instructional component provides grade and age level appropriate instruction in the required content area subjects in  English supported by English as a second language methodologies. In order to support the students, our content area  and soon-to-be certified ESL teacher works with emerging ELLs for the required 360 minutes per week, while our  Expanding and Commanding level students receive 180 minutes and 90 minutes respectively of support. Support is  push-in and/or pull out depending on the student and that students’ schedule. Our school uses heterogeneous  grouping in classes, but when possible, the ELL students are grouped together in a block when the ESL teacher pushes  in for support.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     NA   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      NA   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?    Our school has two certified and experienced ESL teachers who provide services to our small ELL population (11 students)  through a combination of push-in and pull-out support. This instructional support is tailored to the individual needs of each  learner and is equivalent in total minutes to state mandates for each level of English proficiency. There are five levels of  learners (Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding, and Commanding). Our school only has learners who are labeled  Emerging (receive 360 mins./week), Expanding (180 mins./week), and Commanding (90 mins./week). The ESL teacher’s  administrative duties are eliminated so that she has time in her schedule to meet with these students. The Emerging students  360 mins. are divided into 90 mins. of stand-alone ENL, 180 mins./week of ELA instruction, and 90 mins./week of content area  instruction. The Expanding students required minutes are divided into 180 mins./week of ELA/ENL  or another content area,  which varies between history, math, or science. The Commanding students receive at least 90 mins./week of ENL/ELA or  another content area, which varies between history, math, or science.  In addition to direct instruction, we make extensive use of an electronic platform for student writing which allows for our ESL  teacher to have real time access and provide timely support to ELLs in their writing across all content areas. In addition, the  ESL teacher provides content specific support by reading tests and reinforcing content-specific vocabulary.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Over the past 9 years, our school has invested heavily in training content area teachers to be attentive to language  development. This includes explicit instruction in subject area specific and general academic vocabulary, the scaffolded  introduction of complex text and the use of native language knowledge to predict the meaning of words with common Latin  roots. Texts are often differentiated and visuals are used to allow for comprehensibility. In order to support the development  of more sophisticated structures, in student writing, we've relied upon Judith Hochman's work which, while designed for  students with language related disabilities, provides meaningful entry points and powerful support for ELLs.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   Highly trained bilingual teachers as well as advisors review various samples of writing in the students' native language as well  as hold in-person interviews in their native language.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          102      a. We have no current ENL students who are SIFEs, but our small population of ENLs allows us to provide highly individualized  support. Students with interrupted education would be provided with a robust set of native language literacy assessments to  generate an accurate profile of their first language literacy skills. From this a program would be devised which while similar to  that provided any newcomer at our school would pay particular attention to the unique challenges associated with developing  literacy skills in a second language.  b. Our school has a strong track record with newcomers, which is a result of intensive support. Newcomers are provided  regular small group instruction with our ENL teacher more frequently than other groups. This instruction involves a systematic  and sequenced introduction to the most critical vocabulary and grammatical structures in the English language. Because the  teacher is working with on average 2 students during these small group sessions, they are highly targeted to the needs of our  newcomers. Our newcomers receive test preparation for the Regents exams as part of their content areas classes and this is  supplemented where needed with additional explanation and translations of content provided by our ELL teacher where  necessary.  c. ENLs who are developing  receive a combination of push in and pull out support depending on their levels of skill. Services  provided to these students emphasize the vocabulary and grammatical structures found in non-fiction academic texts as this is  the area in which these students struggle the most. Because of the small size of the ENL population at our school, these  services are highly targeted. In addition, the ENL teacher monitors and supports student writing across the curriculum through  an electronic portfolio system which serves as a repository of all major pieces of student written work.  d. The student in our school who are long term ENL students are  those whose reading and writing skills are weakest. ENL  services for these students are closely aligned with a wide range of robust academic intervention services provided to all  struggling services at our school.  For students with special needs who are also eligible for ENL services, our special education department and ENL teacher  collaborate closely. Usually these students’ challenges in meeting standards are a product of their disability rather than their  level of English competence. For this reason, the special education teachers working with students in this situation takes the  lead in designing an individualized educational program with the ENL teacher providing support and academic interventions  according to the IEP.  e. We follow up with the content teachers to determine whether the ENL services should continue to be provided.  Test  accommodations such as 1.5x time and translated exams are offered to former ELLs who are still in need of these services  even after placing out within two years. Some former ENLs still receive pull out support in core academic classes that are  vocabulary intensive. Students are allowed for one year of transitional services and two years of accommodations after they  exit the program.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Academic content teachers use a variety of instructional strategies to ensure that our ELL-SWDs have access to the curriculum  and accelerate their English Language development.  For example, teachers will use strategic heterogeneous and  homogeneous student groupings to support students and provide targeted support.  Academic teachers will provided  scaffolded texts to ELL-SWDs to provide access to the content while support their language development.  Additionally,  teachers will provide multiple modalities for students to demonstrate their understanding - from presenting learned material  orally, through writing, or other forms of expression.        7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Our school uses an integrated ENL program, which is least restrictive because the students are in class with all English-speaking  students. To support our students they can be pulled out or have support pushed in depending on their schedule and classes.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  ELLs are offered targeted small group instruction in ELA, math, and other core content areas. In ELA, students are provided  push in support, pull out for small group support, and after school tutoring. Math students students are provided push in  support, pull out for small group support, and after school tutoring. Specifically, one student who is an ELL and failed his math   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          103      regents, gets one-on-one tutoring with the ESL teacher in a pull out scenario and works within a targeted small group setting  as well. Social studies students are provided push in support, small group support, individual tutoring, and sometimes have  tests read to them. ELLs who are in a Regents science class or former ELLs who failed a Science regents have small group  tutoring where they get vocabulary support and discuss key concepts. Based on the data of former regents test scores and  current mock-regents exams, students are signed up for mandatory tutoring sessions for targeted support.  These sessions are  before and after school as well as during lunch time. Sometimes they are on Saturdays as well. While the primary language of  instruction for these services is English, in some cases arrangements are made to pair Spanish speakers with instructors who  are fluent in Spanish so that they can provide key explanations in the students native language where appropriate and  facilitate the acquisition of vocabulary by highlighting Spanish - English cognates.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      With two ESL teachers who are new to our school, but veteran educators, our plans is to improve their understanding of the  ELL program (policies, regulations, and support strategies) and the best ways to support the students, especially since about  half of our ELL  population are new to our school every year. The new program or strategy will be to determine through  scheduling the best way to support students. This is because it is difficult to balance each student’s needs while teaching full  time and only having specific moments in the day when support can be provided. In addition, another area of improvement  will be to make sure that the staff knows who are the ELL students, where their information can be found, and what the levels  actually mean. Teachers will also be made aware of how to use translation services. The reason this is an area of improvement  is because some people on the staff seem to be aware, but not all.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   No programs will be discontinued for the coming school year.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All ELLs are offered the same core classes and electives as non-ELL students. All school programs are communicated to ELLs  through daily advisory announcements, and frequent, school-wide emails. All ELLs participate in our school-wide advisory  program where they are matched with a faculty member for all four years at our school.. ELLs communicate with their advisors  on a daily basis. The advisor meets with them daily to review academic progress, set goals, and work on College and Career  Readiness targets. All ELLs are offered tutoring and enrichment before and after school as well as Saturday school. Students  are invited to stay and receive additional supports after school by academic advisors and teachers based on weekly progress  reporting. School-based clubs meet after school and are open to all students. The school counselor shares opportunities with  myriad extracurricular clubs, activities, events, and internship opportunities. ELLs are informed of all school programs through  verbal announcements made by their advisor, weekly email communications sent directly to students and parents, and  monthly communications that are mailed home.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Where deemed necessary by our ENL and content area teachers, our school provides students with content area reading and  reference materials in all native languages spoken by our students. In addition, we rely heavily on technology. Every teacher  has access to a SMART Board and computer cart every period which allows for the extensive use of audio-visual material to  support student learning. This allows even beginner ENLs a variety of entry points to academic content. In addition, we make  available the web based version of Rosetta Stone as a supplement for beginner ENLs so that they can practice listening and  speaking outside of class time and independently.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Native language support is provided through content area teachers fluent in ELLs native languages as well as through a variety  of native language reading materials.       14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Materials in English are leveled by proficiency and materials in native language are provided for those with low proficiency. At  high school level, we craft materials that are revelant for adolescents by using the academic langauge needed for content   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          104         courses, the language needed to thrive in NYC, and topics of interest for their age group.  Students receive pull out or push in support in their academic classes that is different according to grade level.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Where deemed necessary by our ENL and content area teachers, our school provides students with content area reading and  reference materials in all native languages spoken by our students. In addition, we rely heavily on technology. Every teacher  has access to a SMART Board and computer cart every period which allows for the extensive use of audio-visual material to  support student learning. This allows even beginner ENLs a variety of entry points to academic content. In addition, we make  available the web based version of Rosetta Stone as a supplement for beginner ENLs so that they can practice listening and  speaking outside of class time and independently.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   ELL students are invited to participate in a Summer Bridge (pre-freshman) program where they interact with students and  teacher. The school’s leadership team of the Principal and Assistant Principals coordinate the Summer Bridge program, and  teachers and the ESL coordinator facilitate activities with the students.  Our school does not take mid-year transfers.     17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Students at our school are only offered electives in their senior year. Language electives are offered through the production  (our specialized program) and the Humanities departments, such as the Language of Film, and Literature and Film. During their  freshman year, students are required to take  a foreign language, which at our school is Spanish.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   NA     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  TvF has scheduled, structured professional development time each week from 3:00 - 4:45 pm.  During this weekly meeting  time, all staff, including the Principal, Assistant Principals, teachers, paraprofessionals, social workers,secretaries, parent  coordinators, and speech therapist engaged in structured professional development activities. Each faculty member at TvF  creates an individualized PD plan each school year that identifies both instructional and non-instructional goals and intended  outcomes for all students, including outcomes for ENLs, in their PD Plans.  The school’s instructional cabinet then develops a  series of cycles of learning that focus on departmental goals, grade team goals, and specific instructional goals.  Our ELL  personnel has one of these PD plans and engages in specific, specialized PD in order to support their development in reaching  those professional goals.  Our school has weekly PD sessions on Wednesday afternoons and sometimes all day PD during teacher work days. ENL  workshops are run during Wednesday faculty meetings on language development and issues particular to ENLs. In addition,  department and grade teams  meet to determine how to teach the CCLS and how to reach individual students. Topics of PD  sessions  include but are not limited to: 1) the distinction between academic and non- academic vocabulary and the challenges   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          105         associates with acquiring the former for ENLs and former ENLs, 2) techniques for teaching academic vocabulary, 3) common  challenges facing Spanish speakers in the acquisition of English as a second language. These sessions are run by the ENL  teachers. All faculty including the assistant principals and the social workers, participate in these sessions.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Our school meets the professional development requirements by providing 50% of specific PD sessions for ENL-specific  professional development. The ENL coordinator receives professional development weekly for one hour and forty five  minutes.  Over the course of the year, over 50% of this professional development allows the ENL coordinator to engage in PD  opportunities that support her practice as an ENL practitioner. These session focus on topics like effective classroom  communication student engagement, and assessment practices. In addition, the ENL teacher meets during PD time with the  Special Education department to ensure ENL strategies are implemented in the most effective ways and to provide PD to co- teachers who are providing instruction to core content classes.  An accounting of the total hours of professional development  including time dedicated for ENL training is kept both electronically within our database, and hard copies of attendance with  signatures is kept.         Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Our school meets with the parents or guardians of English language learners at least once a year, in addition to parent-teacher  conferences, initial parent orientations, quarterly progress meetings or other scheduled meetings provided for parents or  guardians, to discuss the goals of the program, their child’s language development progress, their child’s English language  proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas. This additional meeting includes staff  necessary to sufficiently inform the parents or guardians about the child’s language development in all content areas. The  meeting is conducted with a qualified interpreter/translator in the language or mode of communication the parent or guardian  best understands. Our schools records the attendance and maintains the records of these meetings. Often, these meetings are  scheduled on the same day as the quarterly conferences or during IEP meetings, because it is easier for the parent.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  Parents are highly involved in our school - We believe is responsible for the consistently high levels of satisfaction they express  on Learning Environment Surveys. Four times per year, parents are invited for conferences in which they are presented with  narrative descriptions of their children's performance in every academic class, comprehensive grade reports form electronic  grade books, and a wealth of data charting every aspect of a child’s performance and participation at our school. Just under  90% of parents participate in these conferences on average.  For families that do not speak English, conferences are held with  a translator, who is the parent coordinator, or another teacher who speaks the language of the family.   Our bilingual parent  coordinator and other bilingual staff members facilitate outreach for scheduling these conferences and translation during  these conferences to ensure that the parents of ELLs are able to enjoy full participation in this process. ELL parents participate  at levels consistent with non-ELL parents in the activities described above. While these are the mandated conferences, this  time is used to discuss ELL goals. IEP meetings are also occasions where these meetings take place since our Special Education  team and ELL teacher work closely together. Additionally, all parents are invited to and participate in annual yearly events like  our student film festival and competition.            2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          106      Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Edgar Rodriguez, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          108                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   Academy for Careers in Televis                                                                              School DBN: 30Q301  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Our school maintains internal databases on google drive with student information, including language status, to  easily flag non-English speaking parents and their preferred language for communication. Advisors and our Parent  Coordinator update the database, which is accessible by all staff members within the school. Administrators are  able to sort parent interpretation needs by language and can staff events (such as parent teacher conferences,  open houses, PTA meetings) accordingly. If any student entering our school does not have information in ATS on  the HLIS screen, the pupil personnel secretary invites the family in to complete the HLIS with the ESL coordinator.  Additionally, we can use the blue cards data, parent survey, and ATS Report of Preferred Languages.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          110     2.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      We have a number of native speakers on staff who can easily communicate with our limited-English-proficient  families and also use the DOE translation phone service.             Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      During a staff meeting we will provide staff with information on how to contact the translation and interpretation  service at NYC DOE. This information will also be emailed to staff so that it is easily accessible. Furthermore, copies of  the T&I brochure will reside in the main office in case anyone has questions or wants additional information.          Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      We determine within 30 (thirty) days of a student’s enrollment the primary language spoken by the parent of each  student enrolled in our school, and if such language is not English, whether the parent requires language assistance in  order to communicate effectively with our teachers/advisors/staff members about the student. We also maintain an  appropriate and current record of the primary language of each parent and maintain that information in ATS and on  our google database with emergency contact information. We provide each parent whose primary language is a  covered language and who requires language assistance services with a copy, in their home language, of the the Bill of  Parent Rights and Responsibilities which includes their rights regarding the translation and interpretation services. In  addition, we provide the school's safety plan with procedures for ensuring that parents in need of language services  are not prevented from reaching the school’s administrative offices due to language barriers.             2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          112     Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       Quality and availability of services are assessed formally through the Learning Environment survey each year, but we  are open to informal and ongoing feedback from parents about their experiences accessing school staff and  information about their child’s education. This process allows us to make immediate modifications and improvements  when needed. During our Parent Teacher Conference meetings held four times a year, parents and families will be  able to offer in person feedback to their child’s advisor and the school’s administration regarding the quality and  availability of services.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          113
