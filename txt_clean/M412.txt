This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. Lab School for Collaborative Studies, in compliance with the Section 1118 of  Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent  involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the  families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision- making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School  Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of  the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   N.Y.C. Lab School for Collaborative Studies will support parents and families of Title I students by:   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent  Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.    Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;      The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.         School-Parent Compact (SPC)   N.Y.C. Lab School for Collaborative Studies, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student  Succeeds Act (ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student  achievement between the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and  programs funded by Title I, agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will  share responsibility for improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be  developed to ensure that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  As a high school we do not need to assess for early literacy skills.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Please see above.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We evaluate the success of our ENL program by examining students’ improvement in NYSESLAT exam scores, their grades in  content area courses and credit accrual, as well as the scores in NYS Regents examinations.        4.

Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   a. All ENL instruction at our school is delivered in integrated ENL classes.  ELLs are not pulled out of any class.  The ENL  teacher, Sarah Mirabile, collaborates with content area teachers in classes such as English Language Arts, AP U.S.  History, and 10th Grade Global Studies, in order to support ELLs in language acquisition and mastery of content area  material. The ENL teacher co-plans and co-teaches with the subject-area teachers of the classes that where she  pushes in each week, in order to ensure that ENL students are provided access to the content-area language  necessary for success in each class.       b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A    c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   We have an ENL teacher, Sarah Mirabile, who provides the mandated number of instructional minutes.  We have no beginner  ELLs, but would provide 540 minutes per week if we did.  For the two Transitioning/Intermediate ELL currently enrolled at our  school we will provide 180 minutes per week. The Commanding ELLs will receive 90 minutes of instruction. All students will be  offered additional instructional time during study hall and office hours, as necessary.  Our school is on a mandated,  instructional 1-9 period schedule and additional ENL support classes are offered period 1, so as not to conflict with any content  area classes or electives.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   ELLs participate in inclusive, streamlined English language content courses with their English proficient peers. They are  supported in all content areas during optional first-period study hall by the ENL teacher, Sarah Mirabile. In addition, ELLs  receive daily integrated instruction in specific content area classes that are co-taught with the ENL teacher and content area  specialist each week. During these classes students have native language support through the use of bilingual glossaries,  dictionaries, and online resources. English language work is scaffolded and made comprehensible through the use of graphic  organizers, visual aids, simplified language, and native language materials.  The ENL teacher, Sarah Mirabile, works  collaboratively with content area teachers to ensure that ELLs are supported as they work toward and meet the requirements  of the Common Core Learning Standards.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   Incoming ELLs are evaluated in their home languages by bilingual pedagogues at the school (currently there are teachers  speaking Spanish, Chinese, French, and Russian).  In the case of a student speaking a language not spoken by any staff  members and in which we were unable to use translation and/or interpretation services, we would solicit help from our  BFSC.  We would specifically solicit help from the Deputy Director for ELL support and our designated District 2 specialist.            5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a.  We currently have no SIFE students, but if we did we would differentiate support by providing additional time with the ENL  teacher, placement in SGI classes based on need, and additional support and family outreach from guidance counselors.  b. Newcomers receive mandated instructional time with an ENL certified teacher, Sarah Mirabile, who supports them in their  content classes while also working to improve language proficiency.  The amount of instructional time is based on proficiency  level as determined by the LAB-R/NYSITELL. Home language support is part of these classes and newcomers are encouraged to  read and research in their home language, in addition to English. Translations are provided when possible and testing  accommodations are made.  Newcomers are frequently paired with former ELLs and native English speaking peers who can  support them.    c. Developing ELLs continue to participate in integrated ENL/content area classes that are co-taught by a certified content area  teacher and an ENL certified teacher. They continue to receive testing accommodations. They also continue to receive home  language support, and are encouraged to read and research in their home  language, in addition to English. They are frequently paired with newcomers to help the newcomers adjust to the school  language and environment.   d.  Long term ELLs will receive support in integrated ENL/content area classes and with testing accommodations. The ENL  teacher will work with guidance, the school psychologist, and each grade and department team in order to determine a plan  for long term ELLs to improve language proficiency.  e.  During the first and second years after testing proficient, former ELLs will receive 90 minutes of scheduled, integrated class  support each week years. They will continue to receive testing accommodations, facilitated by ENL teacher Sarah Mirabile.         6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   The ENL teacher and coordinator, Sarah Mirabile, works in conjunction with special educators and content area teachers in  order to determine the needs of ELL-SWDs.  These students receive extra time on exams, separate location for exams, and all  other mandated services (use of bilingual dictionaries and glossaries, etc.). The ENL teacher works with content area teachers  to ensure that content vocabulary is a main focus in each class. We use word walls, vocabulary lists, and modified notes and  graphic organizers to facilitate ELL instruction. In addition, ELLs receive instructional time with an ENL teacher and, when   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      appropriate, can be enrolled in SETTS or ICT inclusion classes for content area coursework, in accordance with their IEPs.  Teachers specifically certified in special education will modify curriculum and instruction as per IEPs.  We currently have 2 ELLs  with special education accommodations.  In the case of the arrival of a student with an IEP and parents who request bilingual  services, Guidance Counselor Jennifer Schatz would work with families, with the aid of translation and interpretation provided  by teachers speaking second languages (currently there are staff members speaking Spanish, Chinese, French, and Russian) or  through NYC DOE interpretation services, in order to facilitate a transfer to a high school with a bilingual program for students  whose IEP mandates bilingual instruction.  We currently have no students with IEPs mandating bilingual instruction.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Our school offers ICT inclusion classes and SETTS for students with IEPs.  These inclusive models allow students with IEPs to  receive the curricular and instructional modifications while participating in classes with their general education peers. Optional  ENL classes are scheduled during periods 0 and 1 so that all ELLs, including ELL-SWDs, may receive language support without  missing any time in content area courses and still have the opportunity to participate in electives and foreign language  classes.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  For ELLs that might need targeted intervention programs we provide small group instruction (available for all content areas -  ELA, Social Studies, Math, and Science), after school peer tutoring, and Regents preparation sessions.  Given the small number  of ELLs (4), we offer all targeted intervention in English only during office hours that are part of a mandated instructional  period "1" at the beginning of the school day. The ENL teacher will always collaborate/ consult with all subject area teachers to  support language acquisition and mastery of content area language necessary for student achievement in each course.         9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      During the upcoming 2017-2018 school year the ENL teacher Sarah Mirabile will be co-teaching in an inclusive, integrated  environment to support the 4 ELLs at our school. At the current time, we predict that the ENL teacher will be co-teaching in an  11th  grade AP U.S. History class and a 12 th   grade English Language Arts class.          10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   This year we will be adhering to current regulations relating to the English language level of our students by assuring that they  are provided with integrated instruction in content-area classes.          11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  We use the push in, integrated co-teaching model for our 4 ELLs to ensure that they do not miss time in their content area  classes while they simultaneously improve English language skills. For ELLs that might need targeted intervention programs we  provide small group instruction (available for all content areas - ELA, Social Studies, Math, and Science), after school peer  tutoring, and Regents preparation sessions. We also use translation services to ensure that all school communication is  communicated to our ENL students in their parent/guardian's home language.          12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  We will have at least 4 Spanish-speaking ELLs in our school during the upcoming academic year (2017-2018). To support these  students, at the beginning of the year the ENL teacher will contact all teachers working with these students in order to remind  teachers of the services and instructional materials these students need for support. The ENL teacher will also work directly  with the ELLs during integrated, co-taught, content area classes each week. During these sessions, ELLs will be able to use  bilingual dictionaries and glossaries, they can work with preferred peer partners (sometimes speaking the same home  language, sometimes not), they will be granted time extension and the option of testing in a separate location. The ENL  teacher will provide visuals and use role-play and modeling as frequently as possible to further facilitate learning. The ENL and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      content area teachers will work collaboratively to co-plan and co-teach content classes in a way that supports ELLs through  their learning.              13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Our school exclusively uses the ENL model to support English Language Learners. Our ELLs participate in integrated  ENL/content area classes co-taught with a certified content-area teacher and an ENL certified teacher. In these classes and  during study hall and after-school hours, our ELLs receive home language support (i.e. through the use of online and paper  bilingual dictionaries). They are encouraged to read and research in their home language, in addition to English. They are  allowed to use bilingual dictionaries in their home language to facilitate learning. Our ELLs are also offered the option of  working with peers who speak the same home language in order facilitate content area learning through  "translanguaging" practices.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Each our 4 ELLs will receive support in integrated ENL/content area classes. The ENL teacher will push in to these classes in  order to support ELLs as they work in their subject area classes with native English-speaking peers at their grade level. At the  beginning of the year, the ENL teacher will contact all teachers working with our ELL population in order to remind them of  services these students receive, such as testing accommodations. The ENL teacher will work with guidance, the school  psychologist, and the grade team for each ELL in order to determine a plan for ELLs to improve language proficiency.        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Our ENL coordinator will collaborate with other ENL teachers in the building at two key points in the year, when  the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT exams must be administered and graded. At the current time, we know that we will have at least 4  Spanish-speaking ELLs in our school during the upcoming school year (2017-2018). To support these students, at the beginning  of the year the ENL teacher will contact all teachers working with these students in order to remind teachers of the services  and instructional materials these students need for support. The ENL teacher will also work directly with the ELL students  during integrated, co-taught, content area classes each week. During these sessions, ELLs will be able to use bilingual  dictionaries and glossaries, they can work with preferred peer partners (sometimes speaking the same home language,  sometimes not), they are granted time extension and the option of testing in a separate location. These are all considered  positive "translanguaging" practices. The ENL teacher will also provide visuals and use role-play and modeling as frequently as  possible to further facilitate learning. The ENL and content area teachers will work collaboratively to co-plan and co-teach  content classes in a way that supports ELLs through their learning.      16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   At the beginning of the year, the ENL teacher (Sarah Mirabile), the school counselor (Jenn Schatz), and the Assistant Principal  (Christina White) work together to ensure that newly enrolled ELLs and their parents receive the services and programming  that they need. In the event that ELLs enroll during the school year, ENL certified teacher Sarah Mirabile would support them  in their content classes while also working to improve language proficiency. Home language support is part of these classes  and new arrivals would be encouraged to read and research in their home language, in addition to English.  Translations would  be provided when possible and testing accommodations would be made. These students would be paired with former ELLs  and native English speaking peers who could support them. The ENL teacher would also work the school counselor and the  students to monitor social-emotional development and other academic progress.           17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    Along with English courses, all ELLs are offered the opportunity to take Spanish classes along with their peers at our school.         18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47         In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A      Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  Assistant Principal Christina White will inform ENL teacher and coordinator Sarah Mirabile of and will encourage ENL teacher  and coordinator Sarah Mirabile to attend all professional development opportunities related to ELL education.    In addition, all teachers of ELLs are encouraged to attend city-wide professional development in ELL instruction and supporting  ELLs as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards. Department meeting time will also be used for Common Core  review and alignment. The potential PD dates on schedule as of now are November 9, 16, December 7, 14, January 4, 11,  February 1, 22, 29, March 7, 21, April 4, 11, May 2, 16.             2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  The ENL teacher and guidance counselors meet with content area teachers to discuss ways that ELLs can be supported. The  ENL teacher, Sarah Mirabile, provides content area teachers with a list of ELL students, results from their LAB-R/NYSESLAT  exams, and information on testing accommodations. The school’s ENL teacher Sarah Mirabile also provides opportunities for  professional development to all staff by presenting (during mandated staff PD sessions) the different teaching strategies and  discussion of modifications that can be used in their work with ELL students.  Records are maintained by the Principal's  secretary who has files with the attendance from staff meetings. Additionally, staff is sent information on city-wide  professional development in ELL instruction.                   Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Parents of ELLs will be invited to meet individually with ENL coordinator Sarah Mirabile at the beginning of the year. Parents  are highly involved in the school community and we have an active Parent’s Association.  Parents of ELLs are encouraged to  join all activities. In addition, the Parent's Association at our school specifically works to facilitate communication, with  bilingual parents notifying parents of ELLs of meetings and events. Parent volunteers have translated weekly announcements  into Chinese, the language spoken by most of our non-English speaking families, in order to keep parents up to date on  important school news. Each semester there is a Chinese Family Night complete with translators, video presentations, and  technology tutorials offered to parents of ELLs. NYC DOE translation and interpretation services are used as well to facilitate  communication in the home language of parents of ELLs.         2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48         Parents are highly involved in the school community and we have an active Parent’s Association.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Brooke Jackson, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   NYC Lab School for Collaborati                                                                              School DBN: 02M412  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      We conduct home language survey of students, we have organized a Parents' Association taskforce outreach;  teachers will survey classes; and the guidance department helps to review the cases of students from non-English  speaking households. In addition, ATS provides us with official reports indicating number of students whose home  language is other than English who require both written translation and oral interpretation. Findings have been  communicated during SLT meetings, Parent Association meetings, scheduled meetings with principal and parents,  faculty conferences and department meetings with the school community. As of Fall 2015, ATS tells us we have  155 households whose home language is one other than English: Albanian= 7, Amoy= 6, Arabic= 2, Bengali= 2,  Bulgarian=1, Cantonese= 42, Chinese (dialect unknown)=3, Chinese (any)= 25, Danish=1, French = 4, Italian = 2,  Japanese= 5, Mandarin = 16, Nepali=1, Polish = 1, Portuguese= 1, Russian = 4, Serbo-Croatian = 5, Slovak=1,  Spanish = 19, Swedish=1, Tibetan=1, Urdu=1, Wolof=1. Findings have been communicated during SLT meetings,  Parent Association meetings, scheduled meetings with principal and parents, faculty conferences and department  meetings with the school community.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52       2.
