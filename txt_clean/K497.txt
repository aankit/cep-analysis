The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and informed by New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.   In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          7     comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement      NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.  II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and  Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)     School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.    Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          9        Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Implement at least one USDE Turnaround Principle (e.g., redesign the school day, week, or year; modify   the instructional program to ensure it is Evidence-based, rigorous, and aligned with State academic content  standards; provide time for collaboration on the use of) beginning no later than the 2018-19 school year.     Step 7: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 8: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.      Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Section 4: SCEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?  The Boerum Hill School for International Studies (BHS) serves grades 6-12 in Brooklyn, NY. As an IB World School with  the Middle Years and Diploma Programme, we are committed to the mission of the International Baccalaureate  Program, which is a global group of schools that develop international-minded people who, recognizing their common  humanity and shared guardianship of the planet, help to create solutions for a better and more peaceful world.     2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, including   a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   The Boerum Hill School for International Studies (BHS) is an authorized International Baccalaureate (IB) in both the  Middle Years Program and Diploma Program, we provide curricula in grades 6-10 that emphasize problem-solving and  collaboration through project-based learning. As we enter our second year as an authorized Diploma Program for all  students in grades 11-12, students will have the opportunity to graduate BHS with an IB Diploma or an IB candidate  which can provide college credits and a significant increase of college options and scholarships. The IB provides the  ideal academic framework for educating critical thinkers and problem solvers who are internationally minded-  culturally agile, bilingual and even trilingual. Our aim is support students as they take risks and develop innovative  solutions that impact the world. We aim to foster critical and creative thinkers who appreciate different cultures and  respect the values and rights of people everywhere. We emphasize a balanced liberal arts education developing our  students academically, socially and emotionally to become successful 21st century Global citizens.   A large part of our work as a school community is working to ensure all students receive equitable academic and  cultural experiences through the IB framework. We believe in racial, ethnic, economic, religious and linguistic  diversity. Therefore, our student body reflects the world at large. We are working with our partnerships, Red Hook  Youth Court Restorative Justice, Boarder Crossers and Ramapo for Children to build the work around diversity and  equity. We have also created a school Equity Team which is made up of teachers, students, administration and  parents. The team is focuses on awareness of implicit bias and examining racial attitudes, values and beliefs of the  school community while using data to create instructional practices and school policies that are equitable.    At BHS, our students can study French as beginners and as native speakers of French. By increasing language  proficiency for all learners we aim to create an inclusive and collaborative school culture. We also have been able to  create this with the support of our partnership with FACE (French American Cultural Education) which supports  French-American relations through innovative cultural and educational projects. We offer French language acquisition  in beginners, intermediate and advance classes. The study of French language expands through our French Dual  Language course in grades 6 through 9. The aim of the French Dual Language course is for heterogeneous groupings  of students to engage in French language through speaking, reading and writing while making interdisciplinary  connections to other subjects such as Science and Humanities As we continue to focus on language as a mode to  explore cultural expression and social tolerance, we aim to build an additional language acquisition program in  Spanish.    In order to support and develop the whole child, students engage in extra curricular activities after school and during  the day to support the learning and talents of students. We offer robotics, violin, chess, dance, theatre, soccer, music,  table tennis and basketball.   This year we have joined an unique network of schools know as PROSE (Progressive Redesign Opportunity Schools of  Excellence). Our school-wide initiatives are driven by teachers and leaders working in a fully collaborative community  focused on the needs of students and community at large.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          11      We serve a racial, ethnic, economic, religious and linguistic diverse community of students. Our school program and  instructional practices are designed to ensure that the needs of all students- SWD, ELLs and highest academic and  social need.       4.  Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over the   past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The two elements from the Framework for Great Schools that we have made a great deal of progress in the last year  are Teacher Collaboration and creating a Supportive Environment.   For Fall 2018-2019, we are actively working to build trust while deepening teacher collaboration as we become a  community of critical friends, ensuring consistent instructional practices across classrooms and growing family  empowerment. We believe that trust, collaboration, strong and rigorous pedagogical practices, strong ties and  relationships with families, lead to high levels of student achievement and engagement.    We have created a Supportive Environment where every student has advisory. The adviser communicates to parents  weekly using Managebac, email and grade team level newsletters. Advisers form a strong community with the group  of students to build trust and provide a forum for students to address issues, set individual goals, problem solve with  a supportive adult and community of peers. Restorative Justice practices are used with students to reflect on their  actions and are given opportunities to restore and rebuild relationships that may have been harmed. The Restorative  Justice Team (RJT) trains students as peer mediators with support from The Red Hook Community Justice Center. The  RJT also responds to community conflict utilizing a systematized ladder of consequences and responses to  intervention. This empowers all community members to approach discipline issues with the intention and tools to  heal and restore rather than punish. Student government is another forum where students are able to address  concerns with the leadership team and lead student-generated initiatives. Class Presidents and their committees  facilitate the grade level town halls, meet bi-monthly with the school leadership to address concerns and generate  solutions, administer student surveys, plan grade level field trips and develop service projects within school and local  community. This year, students have rebuilt our school store promoting Positive Behavior Intervention Supports and  have initiated multiple service projects delivering canned goods to food pantries and clothing to shelters for the  homeless.    For the 2018 - 2019 school year, teachers will work collaboratively to develop and refine International Baccalaureate  Units of Study aligned to the Common Core and IB criterion levels that engage students to think deeply about the  content and utilize inter-disciplinary learning to develop innovative student ideas and connections across content  areas. Teachers plan units by aligning Approaches to Learning so that students are practicing grade specific skills in all  of their classes. Teachers also work in Inquiry Groups and department teams to develop strong lesson planning  practices, assessment analysis to inform instruction and differentiation techniques. We have changed the structure of  our learning and collaboration spaces to ensure classrooms spaces are shared within content areas and shared grade  team offices support daily collaboration as we move into building trust and working as a unified team. Additionally,  we have implemented an inter-visitation schedule for department & grade teams to provide teacher to teacher  feedback to develop strong practices around questioning and discussion and student centered inquiry based teaching  and learning. In addition to administrator evaluations and feedback, Coaches, Mentors and Model Teachers will  continue to observe and provide feedback to teachers to support and ensure rigorous instruction and pedagogy.    Teachers are revising summative tasks, using formative and summative assessment data to differentiate up as well as  provide scaffolds for students who need them. Through the use of strong unit and lesson planning practices, teachers  collaborate to improve their practices by using student data to increase learning and create individualized learning  experiences to ensure a productive struggle for all learners. This foundation will move us in the direction of becoming  a Prose School to ensure peer evaluation is a part of our learning organization. We will continue to use Monday and  Tuesday time for CPT and Professional Learning as well.     The main areas that we are focusing on improving this year are: Building Trust, Teacher Collaboration, Consistent  Instructional practices and Parent involvement/participation. Dept. and Grade Teams will meet weekly to horizontally   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          12      and vertically plan using the IB framework. Dept. Teams will focus on the critical friends protocol to provide one  another with feedback on units and lesson plans, while grade teams will work to deepen the kid talk protocol, using  data to create individualized action plans for students.     To enhance our Family Ties, in addition to our advisory structure, our Family Outreach Coordinator will continue to  develop systems of communication with families. We have calendared events for the entire school year, in  collaboration with the PTA and SLT. We have a new website which will be used to update parents and communicate  digitally to the entire community. Our PTA, Family Outreach Coordinator and all staff members will continue to work  on welcoming families through workshops, events, award ceremonies, and Family/curriculum night throughout the  year.    Our school celebrates the accomplishments of students and faculty members and creates opportunities for everyone  to reflect and plan on ways to improve. We are a community of inquirers, problem solvers and reflectors. We know  that the inquiry cycle depends on risk taking, coming up with solutions and making revisions along the way. We are  unafraid to fail and believe that when we work together, with our students at the center of our work, we can achieve  anything.        5.  Identify at least one USDE Turnaround Principle (e.g., redesign the school day, week, or year; modify the   instructional program to ensure it is Evidence-based, rigorous, and aligned with State academic content standards;  provide time for collaboration on the use of data) to be implemented in the 2018-19 school year.   Through PROSE initiative teachers will have 6 additional planning days to focus on vertical and horizontal alignment.             2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          13         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 15K497   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08,09,10,11,1 2   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   632   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   YES   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   # Special Classes (ELA)  # Special Classes (Math)   # Visual Arts  # Foreign Language   % Title I Population  % Free Lunch  % Limited English Proficient   17  16   19  45   % American Indian or Alaska Native  % Hispanic or Latino  % White   # SETSS (ELA)  # SETSS (Math)  Types and Number of Special Classes (2018-19)  # Music  # Drama  # CTE  # Dance   15  14     9   # Integrated Collaborative Teaching (ELA)  # Integrated Collaborative Teaching (Math)   School Composition (2017-18)   57.0%  % Attendance Rate  52.8%  % Reduced Lunch  9.5%   % Students with Disabilities   Racial/Ethnic Origin (2017-18)   % Black or African American   0.9%  25.5%  % Asian or Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander  29.6%  % Multi-Racial   Personnel (2015-16)   Years Principal Assigned to School (2018-19)  % of Teachers with No Valid Teaching Certificate  % Teaching with Fewer Than 3 Years of Experience   1.17  6%  27%   # of Assistant Principals (2016-17)  % Teaching Out of Certification  Average Teacher Absences (2014-15)   Student Performance for Elementary and Middle Schools (2017-18)   ELA Performance at levels 3 & 4   52.1%  Mathematics Performance at levels 3 & 4   Science Performance at levels 3 & 4 (4th Grade) (2016-17)   N/A   Science Performance at levels 3 & 4 (8th Grade) (2016- 17)   Student Performance for High Schools (2016-17)   ELA Performance at levels 3 & 4  Global History Performance at levels 3 & 4  4 Year Graduation Rate   Regents Diploma w/ Advanced Designation   85%  71%  75.0%   0.0%   Mathematics Performance at levels 3 & 4  US History Performance at Levels 3 & 4  6 Year Graduation Rate (2011 Cohort)  % ELA/Math Aspirational Performance Measures  (2015-16)   Reward  In Good Standing  Focus District   Priority School   Overall NYSED Accountability Status (2018-19)   No  No  Yes   Recognition  Local Assistance Plan  Focus School Identified by a Focus District   No   Focus Subgroups   -

At Boerum Hill School for International Studies (BHS), teachers develop curriculum using the International Baccalaureate  framework to ensure content is learned, skills are practiced and concepts are explored. Teachers reflect on and revise  their units of study every quarter and during summer Professional Learning (where over 90% of teachers participate).  Utilizing the IB framework allows teachers to share a common language around instructional practices, to implement  meaningful lessons and tasks that engage students in critical thinking, problem solving, and a love for learning. Each unit  of study is aligned to IB criterion, which correlates to grade level Common Core Standards. Learning targets are  translated into student-friendly and grade appropriate language, so that all learners, including English New Language  Learners (ENLs) and Students with Disabilities (SWDs) can track their progress. Through ATL’s, students develop tools  and skills to learn how to learn. Grade Teams plan collaboratively to align Approaches to Learning (ATL) skills  (communication, self-management, research, thinking, etc.) to ensure cohesion of skills across all content areas.  Curriculum is shared and made public via ManageBac - a planning, assessment and grading IB platform, which allows for  transparency and alignment vertically and horizontally. The Middle Years Programme Coordinator (grades 6-10) and  Diploma Programme Coordinator (grades 11-12) work as model teachers and instructional coaches to assess rigor, align  practices and provide each teacher with curriculum feedback. Coaches work directly with the IB who approve units of  study and hold the school to high standards. Department teams utilize a lesson and student work analysis protocol to  determine what students are learning, how they know and what revisions must be made to ensure students are meeting  instructional goals. The Leadership team developed a year-long Professional Learning plan utilizing partnerships like   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          16      MSQI, Learning Partners, Teachers College, Teaching Matters and district offerings.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?   BHS believes in Restorative Justice practices, where students reflect on their actions and are given opportunities to  restore and rebuild relationships that may have been harmed. The Restorative Justice Team (RJT) trains students as peer  mediators with support from The Red Hook Community Justice Center. The RJT also responds to community conflict  utilizing a systematized ladder of consequences and responses to intervention. This empowers all community members  to approach discipline issues with the intention and tools to heal and restore rather than punish and remove resulting in  a 65% decrease in suspensions. BHS has created a community school that values student voice and a sense of belonging  by utilizing restorative circles, conflict mediation, non-violent communication practices and support from Morningside  Center for Teaching Social Responsibility and Human Root. Additionally, teachers have been trained by Ramapo for  Children during Monday Professional Learning time. They have also been provided with individualized coaching to  ensure restorative justice practices are utilized across all classrooms. The advisory curriculum was developed in  collaboration with the School Leadership Team to ensure every child has an advocate and every parent develops a close  relationship with at least one staff member who guides and supports their student’s academic and social-emotional  development in collaboration with our guidance counselors. Each student has advisory twice weekly where small groups  meet to build relationships with their peers, discuss meaningful topics, engage in community service work and practice  being caring, reflective, empathetic community members. Advisory lessons address issues of bullying, race, class,  sexuality, identity, and testing stress, to name a few and provides students a forum to develop communication,  collaboration and organizational skills. In addition, each Grade Team organizes a monthly town hall meeting with   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          20      students to celebrate academic achievements, IB learner profiles and attendance stars. Student leaders provide  announcements about upcoming events and facilitate a Q&A with the teacher team to address concerns that may arise.  Student government is another forum where students are able to address concerns with the leadership team and lead  student-generated initiatives. Class Presidents and their committees facilitate the grade level town halls, meet bi- monthly with the school leadership to address concerns and generate solutions, administer student surveys, plan grade  level field trips and develop service projects within school and local community. This year, students have rebuilt our  school store promoting Positive Behavior Intervention Supports and have initiated multiple service projects delivering  canned goods to food pantries and clothing to shelters for the homeless. The parent coordinator sends out a week-in- review newsletter to families and a monthly newsletter (via email and backpacked home) to ensure all families are  informed, engaged and empowered to participate in the community.

Families are welcomed into our school community through the efforts of our Family Outreach Coordinator, PTA,  teachers, student advisers, school leadership and support staff. Multiple annual events, like our Global Action Project  Week, PTA Family Day, Curriculum Night and APTT Workshops with families, create a positive partnership between  home and school, where students can see their community as one, united toward a common vision; their academic and  social/emotional success. BHS International Studies is a community school and our mission is for parents to feel a sense  of belonging and ownership over the school. This year, the focus has been on diversity within our school and using data  to support children at home. Parents are given skills, tools and resources to reinforce learning at home through our  partnership with Human Root.    The school-wide trend- Students are demonstrating a trend of progress on the ELA and Math state exams.   Based on our ELA and Math data, students with IEP's and ESL students continue to need extra support   and guidance. In addition, based on our school wide itemized analysis of the ELA assessment, students would benefit  from further support around constructive responses on the test.    The priority need; Increasing the percentage of students who passed the state ELA and Math exams and support IEP and  ESL students by engaging them in additional rigorous tasks.       2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          32       Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.      2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          42     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.      2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          43      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. members of the school community International Studies in compliance with  the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and  implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement  between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving  them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to  actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained  volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   International Studies will support parents and families of Title I students by:     providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level,   e.g., literacy, math and use of technology;     providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and      decision making in support of the education of their children;  fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and  monitor their child’s progress;     providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;     sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and  in languages that parents can understand;     providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and  other members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          44      The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all parents/guardians, including  parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The school community will conduct an annual evaluation  of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The  findings of the evaluation through school surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs  of parents, and enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.     In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the school’s Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed  Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement  and school quality, the school will:                  actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I program  as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title I Parent  Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   Title I Priority and Focus Schools and the parents of students served in the Title I program must jointly agree upon the use of  these additional funds to support increased parent engagement/education to enable parents to effectively support their child’s  learning.   engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated directly to the  school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as described in  the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent Association  (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support and ongoing  professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;      maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. The Parent  Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the parents of children  who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent  Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central  office.;   conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability grade-level  curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and technology training to build  parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State accountability system,  student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning Environment  Survey Report;   host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1st of each school year to advise parents of children  participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in the program and  the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable sections under the ESSA;   schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning or evening,  to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and allow parents to  provide suggestions;   translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and workshops that  address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;                           The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          45      ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between /teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

For the After-School and Saturday Scholars program, we used data from state Middle School  ELA exam, High School ELA Regents exam, Degrees of Reading Power (DRP), high school  students credit accumulation especially in ELA and Social Studies courses and teacher feedback  were analyzed to determine the program rationale. The data show that some of the students have  been at the same proficiency level  for at least two years, and our findings reveal that their  Reading and Writing scores on the NYSESLAT continue to lag behind their Listening and  Speaking scores. Therefore, reading comprehension and writing are the modalities we need to  especially target. We hope that the additional small group instruction will enable the students to  attain a proficient level and test out of the ENL program. On Wednesday, Thursday and Friday  from 2:35-4:05 pm and Saturday 9:00 am-12:00 pm, a certified ESL teacher and ELA teacher  will work with ENL students in the Title III in After-school and Saturday Scholars Program  focusing on reading, speaking and listening skills.  The rationale being that the prescribed  time during the school day is insufficient to close the gap in literacy. The program will be  setup  to target literacy skills and general literacy enrichment. This additional 10 hours of literacy  per week will help to address that issue, and target the requisite reading and writing skills  necessary for making better gains on the NYSESLAT. The program will help to push students  who are struggling to meet IB Language and Literature criteria, Common Core Literacy  Standards for reading literature, as well as the New York State ENL Performance Indicators, for  Standard 1 . The program will serve up to 58 Emerging to Transitioning ELLs from grades 6-12.   To accomplish this end, we will be using NewsELA and graphic novels. This will provide  students with authentic text opportunities, as well as a broad range of choice for groups and  independent reading. The genres of media presented will allow students multiple entry points.  One ENL-certified teacher, in conjunction with an ELA co-teacher will teach both groups. The  language of instruction as well as of the provided materials will be English. All instructional  materials are supplemental and distinct from those used for daily instruction during the week.  Teachers will maintain records such as attendance and tracking progress through our online  grading system ManageBac and Google Doc and make phone calls home, and write emails and  letters in parents' preferred languages and hold parent meetings to encourage students to attend.                2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          51         Part C: Professional Development   Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as  other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.     rationale  teachers to receive training          schedule and duration      name of provider   topics to be covered   Begin description here:             We are forming a ENL committee of teachers, administration and students to focus on the  Problem of Practice-how to ensure ELLs are supported across all the content areas. Many of our  students succeed in their stand alone ENL milieu, but struggle in the content areas- especially  social studies and ELA. To this end, a team of 1 administrator, 1 ENL teachers, 1 ELA teacher  and 1 ELL student, we will read and use parts of the book "Teaching English Language  Learners: Across the Content Areas" by Debbie Zacarain to inform our work in the committee.  Then, the team will turn key the learning from the book into a three PD sessions for whole  faculty.  All teachers working in the Title III program will receive out of school PD through the  borough/DOE sponsored and through our partnership with International Baccalaureate related to  the program. The PD will positively impact the progress of ELLs by encouraging and providing  teachers ways to differentiate materials, develop protocols aligned to student learning and  deepening questioning to support students English development. This will also help ENL  teachers to develop scaffolds for their integrated collaborative teaching work with students in the  content areas by:  1. Determine their ELLs' stages of English language acquisition.  2. Modify assignments and assessments in different content areas for ELLs at different stages of  language development.  3. Ensure that all ELLs participate fully in lesson activities alongside their English-fluent peers.  4. Communicate effectively with parents and guardians of students from diverse cultures  It will help the administrator, as a supervisor and professional developer of both ENL and  content teachers to ensures that all students are having their needs met. And it will help the ELA  teacher as she develops curricula so that it will be useful to her general education and ELL  students. All members of this study group will turn key their conclusions and findings in  department and grade-team meetings. The ENL committee will meet once per month in January,  February and March. At each of these meetings, we will discuss the themes and questions raised  in our reading (chapter 1-3, 4-6, 7-9, respectively). As we are able, we will make connections to  our own practice, adapt and implement strategies laid out in the book, and report back the  findings of those experiments.   Our first after school meeting will focus on small-group instruction and how to plan for it. Our  second after school meeting  will focus on the relationship between vocabulary instruction and  reading and writing tasks. Our third after school meeting will focus on ELL assessment in the  content areas. Records will be maintained including agendas through Google docs  and  attendance sheets by the ENL teachers. Sessions will be held in November 2018 and January  2019 and March of 2019.

Some of those times will be: Holding a special back-to-school event for  ELL families in which they have time to meet us, school leaders, their children’s teachers, and  school staff. Creating a welcome video in multiple languages. Visiting local neighborhoods to  meet families. Connecting new families with a contact person who speaks their language as soon  as they enroll in the school for guidance and information. Creating an “ambassador” program in  which students and parents are trained to provide guidance on school procedures, services,  policies, academics and other enrichment programs. This year we are continuing to have APTT - Academy for Parents and Teachers with families. The focus of these sessions with parents will  be using the Degrees of Reading Power (DRP) data for their child to inform reading  strategies for them they can use at home to support their child's reading growth.   Our goal is to inform and have parents become experts regarding Math, NYSESLAT, ELA, and  Science state tests; testing exemptions for new ELLs; testing accommodations for all ELLs;  opportunities for ELL students; and the promotional policy for ELLs via letter, and parents  meetings. Correspondence in other languages provided by the Department of Education (DOE) is  routinely distributed to our Arabic, Spanish and French speaking parents; as well as available  DOE correspondence in other languages represented at our school, such as Bengali, Haitian  Creole, and Mandarin. The translation/interpretation unit may be used, if needed, although we  frequently rely on the assistance of multilingual parents and staff within the school  community. The needs of parents are evaluated in informal and formal ways through parent- teacher conferences, meetings, workshops, surveys, school events, PTA meetings, etc. The  educators and administrators have conversations with parents as a way to gain valuable  information about their children, their background, strengths and weaknesses, behavior and  academic work, as well as their socio-economic situation. We work cooperatively with them, and  make student referrals for different services according to the students’ needs. The parental  involvement activities address the needs of the parents by providing workshops, meetings, and  counseling. Parents are also given referrals to outside services whenever it is deemed necessary.   All records will be maintained including agendas, attendance sheets and invitations in parents  preferred languages through our leading ENL teachers involved in the program and parent  coordinator. We view parents as an integral component of our school community and work  closely with them so as to ensure their children’s improvement and success. Certain  correspondence is communicated parents in their home languages, for example back parent  letters home, parent outreach via phone, and parent teachers conferences.    2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          53               Part E: Budget   FOR SCHOOLS NOT CONCEPTUALLY CONSOLIDATED ONLY.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  The school uses a combination of TCRWP, teacher-created assessments, and the Qualitative Reading Inventory, as well as state  assessment data available for each student to evaluate students' needs and to plan for how best to serve them. These data  show a students' reading level at the time of assessment, and can then be used to track growth within the current school year.  These assessments also allow teachers to itemize different sub-skills of reading and writing to target their instruction in ways  that will maximize benefit for ELLs.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   The teachers are provided with common meeting times to review data (running records) to identify student academic and  language needs. The common planning rime allows for teacher collaboration, planning and review of progress.      2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          56         3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Our programs are evaluated based on the results of state assessments. If we are able to demonstrate that students are  performing well, or at least better than they did previously, against these formal criteria, then we can deduce that our  program is effective. If they are not growing in their English-language skills, then we can say our program model should be  revisited.            4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Summative data is compared and aligned to learning goals. Students not meeting goals are provided with small group  instruction as well as push-in/pull-out services. Student goals are created and both summative and formative assessments are  used to measure growth.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   n/a     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The data have shown that, consistent with prevailing theories of second language acquisition, many of our ELLs without IEPs  progress quickly along the language continuum; however they become stuck in the intermediate levels and advanced,  requiring greater push to achieve a score of "Commanding" on the NYSESLAT.     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   There is minimum of two common planning time provided for grade teachers and subject group teachers and one period per  week for vertical planning. During vertical planning meetings, ENL teachers have the opportunity to examine data plan for  instruction and make adjustments.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   The goal of our school language program is to enable our ELL students to develop the linguistic, coginitive, and  affective skills they need to function in the school and community at large. Addtionally, our goal ultimate goal is to  provide our students with the tools they need to be successful in college, career and as an active citizen. At our school  the ENL program provided consist of ICT classes on all grade levels and in varying subject areas.We currently have two  freestanding classes/groups for middle school grades 6-8 students and one freestanding high school class/group. Each  class/group meets four times a week as regular 45 minutes class period (180 minutes total) with a fully certified ESL  teacher. Data from the NYSESLAT and NYSESITELL were used to determine placement of students.        b.  TBE program.  If applicable.          n/a   c.  DL program.

Currently, our grades 6-8 are taking Social Studies in French and  receive additional French language instruction in our after-school program.        2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              Student transcripts and test performace data is used to designed each ESL student's program. The ESL teachers and  school programmer have developed a system to audit ESL students programs to enure that students are receiving the  instructional minutes according to their proficiency levels. There are two freestanding middle school classes that serves grades  6-8 and one high school freestanding class (180 minutes). There are two ICT 6th grade science classes (each 180 minutes), one  ICT 7th grade science (90 minutes) and ELA class (90 minutes), one ICT 8th grade ELA class (180 minutes), one ICT 9th grade  Government class (180 minutes), one ICT 9th grade science (45 minutes), one ICT 10th grade ELA class (90 minutes), one ICT  10th grade United States History class (135 minutes), one ICT 11th grade ELA (45 minutes), one ICT 11th grade Global Studies  (90 minutes) and one ICT 12th grade ELA (45 minutes).    All ELL students receive the daily requirment of ESL instruction as determined by the LAB R and the NYSESLAT and NYSITELL by  fully certified ESL teachers. Other data from students test performance scores (i.e. Regents) and transcripts are used to  developed students individualized student programs.                       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   achievement     Core content is delivered in a more-or-less English-only environment. ENL and content teachers do not necessarily have the  necessary second language skills, themselves. Therefore, we have implemented co-teaching of content courses wherever  possible to ensure that necessary and effective scaffolds are in place to meet the needs of students who are below proficient  in English. During instruction, we use these scaffolds to ensure students are working toward acheivement of the Common Core  Learning Standards, through work with varying levels of text and adjusted requirements based on their levels of proficiency.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?     <!--{cke_protected}%3Cmeta%20charset%3D%22utf-8%22%20%2F%3E-->  There are several tools used to evaluate ELLs in their native language. The initial identification is done using the HLIS. The  answers are verified and analyzed by the ENL teacher. Once a potential ELL is identified and screened as eligible for testing, the  ELL student (Spanish speaking) is given the Spanish LAB as a form of language dominance. Once placed in ENL classes (Stand  Alone and/or Integrated) ELLs are given baseline and baseline assessments. Informal tests in the content areas, and common  core performance task are also used across the grades to evaluate native language throughout the year. The inquiry teams  targeted students are given informal assessment in Native Language according to targeted skills. Data is analyzed and  instruction driven according to students' weaknesses.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.

What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Teachers us our IB program framework and differentiation tools and resources, like newsela.com and TC reading materials to  support individual student needs.      7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Most of our ELL-SWD are served in an ICT setting. Our goal is to have all ELL-SWD mainstreamed in the least restrictive  environment (ICT setting) within one year. All students participate in Art, Advisory, Dance and Physical Education with their  peers.      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  The targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, Math and other content areas are small group afterschool intervention  instruction in all subject areas, Saturday Academy, and Credit recovery online programs.           9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      Providing more professional development opportunities to teachers and staff on ENL program and Dual Language Program        10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   Self-contained and pull out models will be discontinued because it hindered students language and overall academic and  social  development.         11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Nicole Lanzillotto, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          62                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   The Boerum Hill School of inte                                                                              School DBN: 15k497  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.         The data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written  and oral communication include collecting data via the following forms: *student Registration Form *HLIS  *Emergency Contact Card(Blue Card) *ATS Reports( RCPL,RAPL,RCON),etc.   At BHS, our main languages are English, French and Arabic with a few students speaking Hatian Creole and  Spanish.This information was obtained from the RHLA report in ATS.We also use information obtained from the  HLIS. There are two questions on the HLIS (Part 3--Parent Information) which asks parents in which language  they would like to receive written information; and in which language they would prefer to communicate orally  with staff. We use the data collected from this information to assess our school's written and oral  interpretation needs. We also look at the RPOB to assess the languages spoken in our school. Furthermore, we  review the data in our LAP to verify languages spoken in our school. We look at agendas, parents’ notification   2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          64      letters, parents attending PTA meetings, Parent Coordinators logs, Parent/Teacher Conference attendance  sheets,parent teas, after school, evening and Saturday activities attendance and ENL attendance sheets to  assess who attends our activities.              2.

Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      The school provides staff members or hires interpreters in the required language. If necessary and acceptable to the  parent, staff recruits parent volunteers. If this is not acceptable to the parent, or the parent speaks a language that  can not be found among the staff, the school utilizes the phone translation service. Where documents are translated  by the DOE, they are disseminated.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       We will be using the NYC DOE designed surveys and our own parent surveys to gather feedback. We will also form a  parent focus group compromised of speakers from different languages that will help us move the work and make it  more purposeful for kids and families.        2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          67
