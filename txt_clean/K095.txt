This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   School Mission:    Section 4: CEP Overview      We believe that every child is capable of great success. We believe in maintaining high expectations for all students,  parents and staff by providing a safe, respectful environment that will nurture and guide all members towards  becoming self-motivated learners and inspiring leaders. Through this balance each child will be encouraged to achieve   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      excellence in the academic, physical, emotional and social realms. We believe that by working together, we can  accomplish this goal for all students.       2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   Public School 95 is a K-8 Public School that services 985 students in grades Pre-Kindergarten to 8th grade. Our student  body demographics are as follows: 32% Hispanic, 38% Asian, 23% Caucasian and 7% African American. 14% of our  students are identified as English Language Learners and 18% of our students are identified as Students with  Disabilities. Our school is a Title 1, School Wide Project School in which all of our students qualify for free breakfast  and lunch.    Public School 95 has been fortunate to partner with many Community Based Organizations to enrich our school  offerings for students. We have partnered with Neighborhood Improvement Association (NIA), a community based  organization to provide a free after school program for approximately 500 students in grades K-5 through the  Advantage and Empire grants. Last year our school was also awarded SONYC funding which will also service another  100 students with our partnership with NIA. During this time, students receive homework support, exposure to  hands-on content area learning, additional learning opportunities in ELA and Math, as well as extra-curricular  activities such as the arts, movement, sports etc. With the generosity of Councilmen Treyger, our school also has a  partnership with Brooklyn Arts Council, for the past 7 years, which gives us the opportunity to provide additional  visual art opportunities for students in an after school setting. During this program students work under the direction  of professional resident artists and design a growing mural for our entrance way, corridors and hallway doors on  every floor of our building.  Our school was also awarded a grant with Arts Connection for a three year residency for  our ELL students around Theater in Social Studies. With strategic budgeting, our school has also been able to provide  several after-school programs and a Saturday Academy to provide extended learning time for targeted groups of  students, in all grades, to ensure all students make academic gains.      As a school community, we continue to look for ways to further enhance our teaching strategies and techniques to  ensure continued growth for all students. Our school community continues to look for ways to increase student  engagement, in all subject areas. This year our school will continue to lift levels of student engagement focusing on  our questioning and discussion techniques, which is our school's priority focus this school year. Our school currently  partners with Teacher's College Reading and Writing Project and Generation Ready to provide continuous Learning  Opportunities to further develop the teaching and learning practices in our school community.    There are many areas of celebration and unique activities going on at PS/IS 95. In addition to many of the items  described in the Framework for Great Schools section of this document, we are also proud of the following things in  our school:     Parents are invited once a month into our classrooms (Parents as Learning Partners) to celebrate their child’s   work, participate in lesson activities and observe lessons in various curriculum areas. Some of these Parents  as Learning Partner events include, but are not limited to: Read with Me Mornings, Math Game Mornings,  Writer's Celebrations, and Classroom Observations in all subject areas etc.).     We are a recipient of a "Leader in Me" Grant which supports our school's mission to grow leaders throughout   our school community. This is inclusive of our Staff, Students and Parents.      We have worked diligently in empowering our students to "give back" to their community through volunteer   and charity activities. These initiatives are organized and run by our middle school students and their Advisory  Coaches. Some of these fund raisers include: Jeans for Teens, Penny Harvest, Socktober, Toys for Tots,  American Heart Association, Support Our Troops, and the March of Dimes.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10           PS/IS 95 also hosts many extra curricular activities to build school spirit such as: staff vs. student basketball   games, school dances, pumpkin patch, Community Parade, art galleries, Chinese New Year Celebrations,  Talent Show, Dance Festival, Music Concerts, Monthly Family Fun Nights, Middle School Musicals, 5 th Grade  Musical, Leadership Day, etc.      We host Lunch and Learn sessions with students and teachers.     Students in grades 5-8 participate in clubs of their choice weekly during their lunch period. These clubs  include; Chess Club, Technology Club, Crochet Club, School Band, Student Government, and Educator’s Club.  The Educator’s Club is unique because it not only involves our Middle School students, but also our  elementary students. The middle school students volunteer their time and push into our primary grade (K-2)  classrooms to reinforce the curriculum being taught in the classrooms (sight words, number facts, buddy  reading).      We have celebrations such as Leader of the Month, Perfect Attendance, Honor Roll and National Junior Honor   Society to celebrate our student’s accomplishments.     Monthly Family Fun Nights invite families into our building, once a month to engage in hands on activities   within each content area (ELA, Math, Science and STEM, Health and Fitness, Art, Music, Dance, Social Studies)  throughout the school year. These evenings are facilitated each month by our Middle School Students and  Staff Members.    3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   14% of our school's students are identified as English Language Learners. In 2018 22% of our school's current English  Language Learners performed at or above grade level on the New York State ELA , which is a 15% increase from 2018  results where 7% of English Language Learners performed at or above grade level standards. In math we calculated a  3% increase in math achievement for English Language Learners moving from 26% in 2017 to 29% 2018.   18% of our students are identified as Students with Disabilities. In 2017 16% of our students with disabilities  performed at or above grade level standards in ELA where in 2018 we had a 7% increase resulting in 23% of our  students performing at or above grade level standards in ELA. Similarly in math our Students with Disabilities  performing at or above grade level in mathematics increased from 26% in 2017 to 29% in 2018 which is a 3% increase.    It is evident that a continued focus on raising student achievement with our English Language Learners and Students  with Disabilities in math and ela is needed.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   In reference to the city’s Framework for Great Schools, Public School 95 has worked diligently to meet the  expectations of all six elements of the Framework. As a school community some of our school’s biggest strengths in  regards to the Framework for Great Schools include:   1.  Rigorous Instruction – Our school’s units of study are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards. High   standards are set in every classroom. Our school received a score of 93% on the NYC School Survey in this  area. The city’s average was 83%. We received an overall score of 4.42 in Rigorous Instruction as measured by  the 2017 Framework for Great School's Report. In addition, for the past four years all students and subgroups  have been identified by the state as making Annual Yearly Progress. As a result, we have been identified as a  school in good standing.    2.  Supportive Environment – Teachers work diligently to ensure all students feel safe, supported and are   challenged to reach their highest potential.

At the beginning of the school year all students in grades 3-8  take benchmark assessments in ELA and Mathematics. Teachers  utilize these results as a baseline score and identify strengths  and areas of improvement for every student. The benchmark  assessment is administered two additional times during the  school year to monitor student progress. Teachers continuously  analyze this data to make necessary adjustments to our pacing  calendar prior to the administration of the NYS Math  Assessment. Teachers meet at least once a week to  collaboratively plan lessons and standard based tasks, reflective  of this ongoing data.    2. Our school's professional development calendar includes a  focus on Mathematics, including lifting levels of student  engagement through critical thinking, problem solving and  student conversation. During this work teachers will have  opportunities to focus on math task design, analyzing student  work products and utilizing data to revise math curriculum  maps and pacing calendars utilizing DOK and UDL strategies.  Middle school math teachers attend outside math professional  development workshops from Exemplars and Metamorphosis  Math several times during the school year. Teachers utilize this  training to make adjustments to teaching strategies and  curriculum maps to ensure all students are making academic  gains in the area of Mathematics. Two Assistant Principals will  also attend monthly district wide training in mathematics and  will be responsible for turn keying this information to all school  members.   3. Every week teachers meet for Math Inquiry, facilitated by our  Math Instructional Lead Teachers. Through the inquiry process,  the Administrative Cabinet and teachers work collaboratively to  evaluate student work generated from Math Exemplars in order  to raise levels of problem solving in Mathematics. Through our  inquiry work teachers revise curriculum maps and determine  next steps in pedagogy for both whole group and small group  instruction.

To keep our Highly Qualified Teachers, quality professional  development has been offered to afford them ample opportunity to build upon the knowledge and experience they  already possess. Thoughtful, professional development that meets the academic needs of teachers will be offered  during the 2018 – 2019 school year as follows:   Teachers College Reading and Writing Project    Universal Design for Learning and Multiple Entry Points    Depth of Knowledge in the Classroom    Accountable Talk and Discussion within the Classroom    Math Exemplars Professional Development    Instructional Shifts Implementation of Units of Study in Writing    Text Complexity    Gold Mansour and Rutherford   Global language project    In addition to quality professional development, teachers are encouraged to remain at our school and take on  leadership roles at our school. This affords our teachers with the opportunity to share best practices with their  colleagues through inter-visitation cycles. Teachers have opportunities to make decisions for the school by being part  of our ELA Instructional Team, Math Instructional Team, Core Inquiry Team, Special Education Support Team and ESL  Support Team. Study groups are also formed whereby teachers can delve deeper into curriculum areas that are of  interest to them.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49         Recruitment of Highly Qualified Staff are posted on New York City's Department of Education's Open Market. On this  system our school is able to specify the desirable teacher credentials for potential candidate. Upon a careful review of  resumes, candidates are screened and interviewed.         2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   Numerous professional development opportunities are provided to all members of our school community. We believe  that it is vital that all stakeholders are knowledgeable about the Common Core Learning Standards and understand  how these standards are effectively implemented into our daily instruction.    All staff members receive weekly professional development opportunities around the Common Core Learning  Standards and Instructional Shifts. In teams, teachers use this information to revise curriculum maps, deepening  questioning skills and develop strategies for teaching. Teachers meet during an additional 40-minute period once a  week on grade level inquiry teams around ELA and an additional 35-minute period once a week around Mathematics.  During these meetings teachers use an inquiry cycle to create common core standard based assessments, norm how  we score student work using standard based rubrics, look for trends in student work, identify small group instruction,  revise curriculum maps and plan with colleagues. As a Teacher’s College Partnership School, teachers receive hands  on training facilitated by Teacher’s College Staff Developers. Instructional lead teachers on every grade attend  monthly professional development days specific to their grade and turnkey the information and content learned to  their grade level colleagues.    Special Education Teachers, as well as, Para Professionals also receive training through our partnership with Gold  Mansour and Rutherford, on how to utilize UDL strategies and plan standard based instruction with supports to  provide access to grade level content and tasks for all learners. In addition, we also partnered with Global Language  Project to support our ESL teachers and classroom teachers that teach our ELL students. These professional  development sessions provide teachers with techniques and strategies to support ELL Learners.    Parent Meetings are also scheduled two Tuesdays a month to inform families about the Common Core Learning  Standards and Instructional Shifts. During these meetings, parents look at the common core learning standards and  engage in standard based tasks to understand the new expectations of the Common Core Learning Standards. Parents  are also given the opportunity to make hands-on, common core aligned activities and games. Parents learn how to  play these games and activities and take them home to utilize with their children. Family Fun Nights are also  scheduled one night a month. Each month our family fun night focuses on a specific subject area. During the evening  families are engaged in grade appropriate activities. Families are also given the opportunity to make and take  activities so they can continue to reinforce the skills and strategies at home.         Part 3: TA Schools Only   3a.

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).  Activities and structures have been put in place to assist preschool children from their early childhood programs to  our elementary school setting. Our school hosts an open house every spring inviting our future kindergarten students  and families to school. At this time we meet with families to discuss kindergarten procedures as well as the academic  expectations of the school year. Parents are able to view our curriculum units of study. They are also given an  opportunity to visit our kindergarten classrooms where they view student work samples and observe our students  actively engaged in their learning. Our school psychologist and parent coordinator also work with our community  preschool centers to obtain additional information about our future students. Parents are invited throughout the  school year to engage in hands on activities with their students. This keeps them informed of the units of study our  kindergarten students are learning.         4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     Our school has many teacher teams that make informed decisions about the use and selection of multiple assessment  measures used at our school. Our math instructional team, ELA instructional team and core inquiry team, all  comprised of a teacher representative on each grade, meet monthly with the administrative staff to discuss the steps  we are taking as a school community to deepen our implementation of the common core learning standards as well  as reflecting upon and refining how we collect and utilize assessment data to drive our instructional decisions. During  our team meetings school wide decisions are discussed and made. Team members disseminate information to the  teachers on their respective grades. Each team works alongside the administrative staff to monitor implementation,  discuss areas of concern and make any needed adjustments. Professional development sessions, along with our  weekly inquiry time is used to analyze our assessment data, revise the pacing of our units of study, identify the  strengths and needs of all students, make grouping decisions for small group instruction etc. Based on the needs of   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51      our students, professional reading and / or professional development sessions are provided to teachers to assist them  with meeting the needs of all of their students.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52        Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       TITLE I SCHOOL PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT POLICY AND SCHOOL-PARENT COMPACT   Parent and Family Engagement Policy   2018 - 2019         School Parental Involvement Policy for PS 95   Explanation : In support of strengthening student academic achievement, each school that receives Title I, Part A  funds must develop jointly with, agree on with, and distribute to, parents of participating children a written parental  involvement policy that contains information required by section 1118(a)(2) of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA).  The policy establishes the school’s expectations for parental involvement and describes how the school will  implement a number of specific parental involvement activities. It is strongly recommended that schools, in  consultation with parents, use a sample template as a framework for the information to be included in their parental  involvement policy. The template is available in the eight major languages on the NYCDOE website. Schools, in  consultation with parents, are encouraged to include other relevant and agreed upon activities and actions as well  that will support effective parental involvement and strengthen student academic achievement. The school parent  involvement policy must be provided and disseminated in the major languages spoken by the majority of parents in  the school.      P.S. 95, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act, is  implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the link between the school and the community. P.S. 95's  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making. Parents  are encouraged to actively participate on School Leadership Teams, Parent Associations, and Title I Parent Advisory   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      Councils, as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school’s community. Educational research shows a  positive correlation between parental involvement and student achievement. The overall aim of the policy is to  develop a parent involvement program that will:     build a home-school partnership that assists parents in acquiring effective parenting skills    provide parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and            decision making  Implement EChalk, School Messenger, and Monthly newsletter to keep parents abreast of the most current  information  Increase parents’ understanding of their right to support their child’s education by being involved in the  educational process  increase the role of the home in enriching education and improving student achievement, and develop  positive attitudes toward the entire school community      P.S. 95's Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and Students With Disabilities. The  findings of regular surveys will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and if  necessary, to revise the Title I Parent Involvement Program and this policy. In developing the P.S. 95 Title I Parent  Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the school’s Parent Association (or  Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on the  proposed Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input.            To increase parent involvement, P.S. 95 will:      actively involve and engage parents in planning, reviewing and improving the Title I program, including the  Parent Involvement Policy of the school;     engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I funds that local education agencies      (LEAs) must set aside and distribute directly to schools to promote parent involvement, including family  literacy and parenting skills;  support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the  Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Advisory Council. This includes providing  technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;     maintain a Parent Coordinator to serve as a liaison between the school and communities. The Parent   Coordinator will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the parents of children who  attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and inviting to all  parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents each  month and file a report with the Central Office for Family Engagement and Advocacy (OFEA);  conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, grade-level curriculum expectations,  accessing community and support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their  children at home.        provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system (e.g., NCLB/State   accountability status, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;)   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55        host the required Annual Meeting to advise parents of children participating in the Title I program about the   school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in the program and the parent involvement  requirements under Section 1118 of Title I, Part A;  schedule additional parent meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning or evening, to share  information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and allow parents  to provide suggestions.  translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed            P.S. 95 will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:     holding an annual Parent Curriculum Conference    holding Family Fun Nights    hosting events/activities during Open School Week    encouraging meaningful parent participation in the School Leadership Teams and the Parent Association (or   Parent-Teacher Association);  supporting or hosting OFEA District Family Day events  continuous hold parent workshops         providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their   children’s progress     developing and distributing a school newsletter                        Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   P.S. 95, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is  implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the link between the school and the community.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?       Our school uses Teacher's College Running Records and Early Literacy Assessments which includes; Letter and Sound  Recognition, concepts of Print to assess the early literacy skills of all of our students.  The ENL students are given the above  mentioned assessments as well as the results of the NYSITELL exam.  The results of this data helps the classroom and ENL  teacher to collaborate and guide instruction. After careful analysis of this data, general education teachers and ENL teachers  are able to group students according to their Reading Level based off of the running record.  Once small groups are formed,  teachers are able to teach guided reading and target specific strategies within a small group.     Mock NYESLAT mock tests are  administered 3 times a year.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67      The ESL Team and classroom teachers collaboratively analyze student data and identify next steps for each student.  Students  are grouped accordingly to receive instruction tailored to their specific needs.  Ongoing assessment data is collected and  anaylzed over the course of the school year to track growth and modify instruction.       3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  ENL teachers as well as classroom teachers review the results of the ELL Periodic Assessment and the Measures of Student  Learning to assess the progress during the school year as well as the TC Running Records to analyze student’s strengths and  identify where they need teaching support in different instructional contexts. To evaluate the success of our programs for  ENL’s we look at the data to find the weakness and strengths. We look at our student’s progress to determine the value of  keeping what works for our ENL population.                      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Students are identified for needing services based on data review.  Students are matched to the appropriate support on a  needed basis.       5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   In order for our school to guide instruction for ENL’s within the response to RTI the following procedures occur: We will look at  baseline assessments as their universal screening to help teachers make instructional decisions. We will examine achievement  in the classroom, analyze data, design and implement targeted supplemental supports. We will monitor progress over time  and plan for mid course corrections. Students will be evaluated for Special Education when they are not responding to rigorous  instruction, along with instruction being provided with increasing intensity. The family of these students will be contacted  throughout the process to foster a partnership to achieve success. For each English language learner who scores below  specified levels of performance on the annual English language proficiency assessment, the school determines which  additional support services should be provided to the student, taking into consideration evidence such as the following:   •     Number of years of instruction in a bilingual education or English as a new language program   •     English and home language literacy   •     Content area and socio-emotional support needs of students with   inconsistent/interrupted formal education (SIFE)   •     English and home language literacy needs of long-term ELLs   •     Results on the annual English language proficiency assessment exam   •     Bilingual education or English as a second language teacher recommendation   •     Content area teacher recommendation   •     Parent or guardian request   •     Sample of student work in English and, if possible, in the home language   •     Bilingual educational evaluation, if the student has or is suspected of having a disability   The support services provided are aligned to any intervention plans (e.g., Academic Intervention Services) that our school is  already providing to all students.             6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   In our school, the majority of ENL students enter in Kindergarten on either an entering, emerging, or transitioning level.  Most  of the ENL's pass the NYSESLAT within the first two years of services.  The majority of our ENL students score higher on the  Listening and Speaking sections than they do on the Reading and Writing components.  The few children who remain ENL   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68         students have been diagnosed with additional learning disabilities.  However, the ENL teacher continues to focus on the  necessary components of the NYSESLAT that they struggle with.          7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   After analyzing the NYSESLAT data, teachers place students in flexible groups to guide small group instruction.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.

Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.             ENL Instruction is delivered using the Push-In/ Pull-Out method. At PS95 all classes are heterogeneously grouped. This  allows for differentiated grouping. Through this program the teacher is able to group students and allows the teachers  to target individual student needs and focus on texts and materials that is appropriate for their ability.  PS 95 has self  contained Special Education classes in Kindergarten, a first and second grade bridge class, a third and fourth grade  bridge class, as well as a bridge class in grades 5 and 6.  We also have a 7  th   grade self contained class and an 8   th   grade self contained class.   The ESL teacher’s use the Push in/Pull out Model to service the Special Education  students. There are also Integrated Co- Teaching (ICT) classes. The pull-out method for ENL instruction is used for  these classes.   Entering and Emerging ELLs receive a total of 360 minutes of service.  This includes 180 minutes  standalone ENL and 180 integrated ENL service within the ELA block.  Transitioning ELLs receive a  total of 180  minutes of service which includes integrated ENL within the ELA block.  Expanding ELLs receive a total of 180 minutes  of integrated ENL within ELA or other content areas.  The commanding ELLs receive 90 minutes of service in  integrated ENL in ELA or other content areas.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A         2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   Entering and Emerging ELLs receive a total of 360 minutes of service.  This includes 180 minutes standalone ENL and 180  integrated ENL service within the ELA block.  Transitioning ELLs receive a  total of 180 minutes of service which includes  integrated ENL within the ELA block.  Expanding ELLs receive a total of 180 minutes of integrated ENL within ELA or other  content areas.  The commanding ELLs receive 90 minutes of service in integrated ENL in ELA or other content  areas.                            3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      All ENL classes are conducted in English with Native Language supports from our bilingual paraprofessionals, as well as some  of our teachers and staff who are bilingual in the languages of our students. Instruction in the content areas are delivered  through co-teaching models with a general education teacher and an ENL teacher. Specific groups of students are instructed   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69      using ENL methodologies providing strategies for language acquisition and comprehension.The English Language Learners at  PS95 are supported with weekly lessons that scaffold comprehension instruction and vocabulary development. The ENL  instructors activate prior knowledge, build background and support academic vocabulary. The ENL teachers provide visuals,  technology, modified texts and use the TPR (Total Physical Response) method to engage in active learning.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      To ensure that our ELL’s are appropriately evaluated in their native languages bilingual dictionaries and glossaries are  provided as well as reading books that are translated into Spanish and Chinese PS 95’s primary languages. The New York State  Math and Science Exam is provided in their native language. The New York State Math Exam is orally translated by our  Bilingual pedagogues if a translated version is unavailable, for example Urdu and Arabic. Some of the instructional materials in  our reading program are translated into languages other than English which in turn not only supports the student but their  families as well.         5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status       In the ENL program, most services are provided in a push in model.  Students that requires 360 minutes of services are  scheduled for a blended model where some instruction is provided in the classroom setting while some services are provided  in a pull out structure.  In both models ESL teachers plan for differentiated groups according to the student's scores on the  NYSITELL and NYSESLAT exams. All students that are scheduled for pull-out program services are grouped together by  proficiency levels and grade bands.   a.     At this time, PS 95 does not have any SIFE students. The SIFE students at PS95 would be supported by our SETSS teacher  as well as the ENL teacher. The SETSS teacher pushes into the classroom during the day to increase academic gains. SIFE  students would participate in small group instruction with the ENL teacher to increase academic rigor.  SIFE student would be  paired with peer tutors. Instructional objectives for all students are constantly changing due to the progression of academic  knowledge; differentiated instruction is taking place on a daily basis according to topics being covered.  b.     Students who are enrolled at our school for less than three years, as well as students who are new to the country and the  English language are engaged in lessons that will immerse them in social and academic language using pictures, tactile objects,  visual cues and audio support. The newcomers at PS 95 will have extra support to work on their phonological awareness skills  to enhance their academic performance to meet all Common Core State Standards. Teachers of both newcomers are  encouraged to go on class trips to enhance social and academic language while giving them meaningful and rich life  experiences. The use of laptops in classroom aids in supporting our newcomers and ENL’s enrolled for less than three years.  For those newcomers and ENL’s enrolled for less than three years in the Early Childhood Grades will have additional support  by the Funded Reading teacher. The Funded Reading teacher pushes into the Early Childhood grades to enhance their reading  and grammar skills. Newcomers and ENL's enrolled less than three years are also supported by peers with in the classroom  who aid in interpreters and translators.  c.     The ENL and classroom teachers will look closely at NYSESLAT scores, State ELA/Math Exams, and Periodic Assessments to  devise a plan for our ELL’s who are enrolled at our school for 4 to 6 years. The teachers will work closely to plan lessons in  order to increase the academic rigor and achieve goals set by both ENL teacher and classroom teacher for the developing  students. Together they plan during the scheduled common preparation periods to develop Reading, Math, Science, Social  Studies lessons as well as appropriate homework assignments. The ENL teacher will look at unit plans in order to develop  lessons that align with classroom lessons as well as to meet with the Common Core Standards. These students are encouraged  to participate in read-alouds, shared and guided reading, as well as the writer’s workshop model. There are electronic  dictionaries in each classroom to aid the students.   d.     At this time we  have 9  long term ELL’s. The long term ELL’s at PS95 would be supported by our SETSS teacher as well as  the ESL teacher. The SETTS teacher would push into the classroom during the day to increase academic gains. Long term ELL’s  participate in small group instruction with the ESL teacher to increase academic rigor. Long term ELL’s will be paired with peer   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70      tutors. Instructional objectives for all students are constantly changing due to the progression of academic knowledge;  differentiated instruction is taking place on a daily basis according to topics being covered.  e.     Former ENL’s will continue to receive extra support from ENL teachers as well as the classroom teachers. These students  receive time and a half on all state exams as well as given extra time on all classroom exams. The classroom teachers are  supported by the ENL teachers with workshops and guidance to ensure academic rigor is being provided for these students.  Together classroom teachers and ENL teachers will develop lessons to meet the needs of students who have reached  proficiency levels on the NYSESLAT. Transitional support for our ELL’s that have reached proficiency on the NYSESLAT will be  addressed through differentiated instruction. Students will be grouped together during classroom time to work on the  necessary interventions to achieve instructional goals. Former ENL students will now receive 90 minutes a week of mandated  English instruction with our ENL teachers. This will help the former ENL students the confidence they need in order to succeed.        6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?      In order to accelerate English language development for our ELL’s in our Special Education classes the teacher’s use a variety of  UDL strategies to enhance language development in academic content areas. All materials are on grade level to promote  academic rigor. ENL teachers use the push in and pull out model where the use of small group instruction is in place to  increase academic rigor as well as to meet academic goals set by the classroom and ENL teachers. The teachers will work  together to develop lessons which will immerse the Special Education students in social and academic language using pictures,  tactile objects, visual cues and audio support. The students will have support to work on their phonological awareness skills  using the program, Fundations, published by Wilson.  The Special Education classes are encouraged to go on class trips to  enhance social and academic language while giving them meaningful and rich life experiences. The use of laptops and Smart  boards in the classroom aid in supporting our Special Education students. Our first and second grade Special education  students are also supported by Bilingual Paraprofessionals. They assist the students in the classroom with the transition to  speaking, reading and writing from their native language to English. The paraprofessionals also aid the parents of these  students as interpreters and translators. All Special Education students receive the prescribed amount of mandated units of  ENL support in order to reach their highest potential of learning.          7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?     Meeting the diverse needs of our Special Education students is not an easy task. The ENL students who are also Special  Education  students are in need of other interventions as well as ENL services. The service providers such as, Speech Therapists, Physical   Therapists, Occupational Therapists, Guidance Counselors, SETTS and ENL teachers  have a meeting  to devise a plan to best  meet the needs of the students. The ENL teachers will push into the classroom during ELA periods to support academic  instruction. The other therapists use both the Push-In/ Pull-Out method in order to have the least amount disruption during  instructional time.        8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  The targeted intervention programs are built into our reading and math programs that are used in the classroom. Teachers  have developed effective lesson plans for the ENL student using Teacher’s College. The teachers have mapped out plans using  ELL instructional strategies for their lessons. The lessons have vocabulary word cards and extended language activities. This is  targeted to stimulate language production and reinforce target vocabulary. Small group activities to include word cards to  practice listening, speaking, reading and writing. This is helpful for our students who are at the entering and emerging levels as  well as our transitioning and expanding students. This program supports every ENL student and scaffold instruction to help  students understand and respond to literature. PS95 is using the math program, GO MATH!, published by Houghton Mifflin  Harcout. GO Math!  is aligned to meet all the Common Core Math Standards. This program will help students achieve fluency,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71      speed and confidence within each grade level. To help our ENL students this program comes with an ENL workbook that will be  used within the classroom. It is designed to help with key vocabulary needed to gain information, develop their  communication skills, and develop higher order thinking and problem solving skills. The program engages the students in  interactive digital manipulatives.  Targeted intervention in Science includes our push-in STEM program with Mrs.Gagliardi  (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math education)  In Social Studies, the ENL teachers push-in to classrooms during this  content area to support the ELLs by using modified texts, trade books, front loading vocabulary, shared reading and creating  differentiated tasks.          9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      An ESL Newcomer after school academy will be available for entering, emerging and transitioning students in grades 3-5  starting in November 2017.  This program will be held two days a week after school from 2:30-4:30.  The program focus  will teach ELLs academic language mastery.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   No ELL programs/services will be discontinued for this school year. The current programs are garnering results within the four  modalities from the ELL population. At PS 95 we believe that with time and consistency  greater results will be evident.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  At PS 95 we examined the effectiveness of the current programs and they are meeting the needs of our ENLs in both content  and language development. In looking at the NYSESLAT data we noticed that student’s scores have risen. The students are  moving toward reaching proficiency levels in all modalities.   Our ENL students have an opportunity to participate in our Story  Studio, Saturday Academy and ENL Summer Enrichment Program. This will encompass different learning styles, which includes  instructional activities that support the individual student’s visual, auditory and tactile style of learning. Our ELL’s are given the  opportunity to hear, see, and interact with Smart Boards. This gives the ELLs the opportunity to encompass the total physical  response approach to enhance real life pictures and seeing objects and places they would have never been given the  opportunity to experience before.  At PS95 we are extremely fortunate to have Smart Boards available for use in every  classroom. In this school, we are also fortunate to have rolling computer carts for each floor of the building. Each rolling cart  holds twenty eight laptops that the students have access to. Additional programs are offered at PS95 for our ENL population  through Title III funding. PS 95 provides a Saturday Academy ENL program targeting our kindergarten through fifth grade  students to increase their English skills. This program will help prepare our ENLs on all state exams as well as the  NYSESLAT.   Aside from our after school program for our ENLs the students participate in our 21st Century after-school  programs. Each class, kindergarten through fifth grade, including our Special Education students participates in class  assemblies / performances. These performances play a beneficial role in developing social and academic skills to all students. It  increases listening and speaking skills. It helps develop vocabulary and comprehension skills for learners at various English  proficiency levels. It also helps build confidence in our students who are in the early stages of language development..          12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  This year at PS 95 we are looking closely at our instructional goals to increase academic rigor. We are developing rigorous  lesson plans and meaningful academic goals to improve student performance. We are working on lessons to align content and  performance with the Common Core Standards as well as looking across the curriculum and developing higher order thinking  skills, practices and questioning for our ENL students. In order for our students to make progress, one of our goals is to develop  a deep understanding of student needs through classroom assessment and professional inquiry that will be shared by both  classroom teacher and the teachers of our ENL students. The ENL teacher’s roles at PS 95 will be to develop the skills needed  to show academic gains, the ENL teacher includes lessons that will increase their oral language development. A Holistic  Approach is used where the four skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing are included every day. The ENL teachers will  continue to use to a variety of resources. The ENL teachers are using Fundations to teach phonics using interactive and  engaging materials. In addition the Imagine Learning computer program is an innovative language and literacy software  program for ENL.  It is used within the classrooms for our newcomers to enhance vocabulary development and literacy skills.  This year we will continue to use the LLI (Leveled Literacy Intervention) program.  This program has proven to be useful in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72      grades 1- 5. This program includes lessons that target vocabulary and literacy skills that allow our ENLs to meet the Common  Core Standards. This program allows for differentiated instruction and includes an Assessment Resource with software to allow  the teachers to track student progress. This program provides the necessary tools needed to improve scores on the NYS ELA  exams. In our Special Education programs iPads have been purchased for the students to have hands on experiences at their  fingertips. This will assist in developing their vocabulary skills.             13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Native language is supported through Imagine Learning software in the classrooms. There are books, audio, videos etc. in  many different languages spoken on this program. We encourage students to borrow materials from the ENL resource room to  work at home with their families. We have fiction and non-fiction books written in Spanish/ English and Chinese/English  dictionaries, the main languages of our students. On our staff, we have several teachers who are fluent in Chinese, Spanish,  Russian and Arabic. We also have an active PTA with many parents volunteering as interpreters.  We do not have a transitional  Bilingual Program or a Dual Language program at this time.         14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.      All required services support, and resources correspond to ENLs ages and grade levels. All ENLs are grouped according to  consecutive ages and grade levels, as well as proficiency levels achieved on the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT exams. ENL teachers  adapt resources to meet the needs of ELL-SWDs by using UDL strategies (Universal Design for Learning). This ensures that all  students have an equal opportunity to learn.  All of the strategies include multiple means of representation, expression and  engagement.             15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    This year at PS 95 we are looking closely at our instructional goals to increase academic rigor. We are developing rigourous  lesson plans and meaningful academic goals to improve student performance. We are working on lessons to align content and  performance with the Common Core Standards as well as looking across the curriculum and developing higher order thinking  skills, practices and questioning for our ENL students. In order for our students to make progress, one of our goals is to develop  a deep understanding of student needs through classroom assessment and professional inquiry that will be shared by both  classroom teacher and the teachers of our ENL students. The ENL teacher’s roles at PS 95 will be to develop the skills needed  to show academic gains, the ENL teacher includes lessons that will increase their oral language development. A Holistic  Approach is used where the four skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing are included every day. The ENL teachers will  continue to use to a variety of resources. The ENL teachers are using Fundations to teach phonics using interactive and  engaging materials. In addition the Imagine Learning computer program is an innovative language and literacy sofftward  program for ENL.  It is used within the classrooms for our newcomers to enhance vocabulary development and literacy skills.  This year we will continue to use the LLI (Leveled Literacy Intervention) program.  This program has proven to be useful in  grades 1- 5. This program includes lessons that target vocabulary and literacy skills that allow our ENLs to meet the Common  Core Standards.

This will assist in developing their vocabulary skills.             16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   We offer a tour of the kindergarten classrooms when newly enrolled students come to register at PS 95. The newly enrolled  student is greeted by one of our ENL teachers.  This activity is before the beginning of the school year as well as new  registrants who enroll in our school throughout the year. For the older students we pair them with another student who can  act as a buddy/translator. This will help the newcomer adjust and feel welcomed to their new surroundings. The school  guidance counselor, who speaks Spanish is always available to help students transition into their new school as well as our  Parent Coordinator.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73         17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?       We do not offer a language elective.      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The ENL staff members attend all professional development that is available within our school building. Professional  development workshops are conducted during the allotted P.D. time throughout the school year as well as ENL Administrative  period once a week.  The ENL teachers also attend workshops given through Brooklyn South Field Support Center, Teacher’s  College and Global Language Project.       Professional development for all staff members including the ENL teachers is ongoing throughout the year as we support our  ELLs as they engage in learning the Common Core Learning Standards. The professional development will be held on Monday  afternoon after school. The staff will work together in developing rigorous lessons that will help the ELLs develop the necessary  tools to meet the Common Core Learning Standards       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  The staff of PS95 is supported by the ENL specialists to assist ENLs as they transition from elementary to Junior High School by  holding workshops with the Pupil Accounting Secretary, the Parent Coordinator and the Assistant Principal to assist in filling  out the necessary paper work. The staff members are also available to guide students and parents in the direction that will  best meet their academic needs.  The guidance counselor receives professional development to assist ELLs as they transition  from elementary to middle and/or high school.      Teachers new to PS 95 as well as the New York City Department of Education will participate in 15% of their professional  development  hours of ENL training. Our staff members will participate in ongoing staff development workshops. The  workshops will be conducted throughout the year to include issues regarding how The English Language Learners can meet the  Common Core Standards. All records of the training will be kept in a binder and monitored to ensure each staff member has  the correct amount of ENL training. The ENL department at PS95 will work closely with school-based staff to create and  conduct interactive workshops. These workshops will be held during Monday P.D. meetings. The teacher workshops will  include Welcoming the New English Language Learner to your classroom; Planning lessons to include the English Language  Learner in meeting Common Core Standards; ENL content areas and provide academic rigor; What types of questions can I ask  to increase academic rigor for our ENL students; Writer’s workshop for your ENL students; How do we get our ENLs to  understand mathematical word problems; Planning lessons for the older ENL student; NYS testing mandates for ELL’s and  Planning for next year are some of the workshops that will be held this year for teachers.              2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74      Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   At PS 95 ENL teachers and classroom teacher meet with the parents or guardians of English language learners at least once a  year, in addition to parent-teacher conferences, initial parent orientations, quarterly progress meetings or other scheduled  meetings provided for parents or guardians, to discuss the goals of the program, their child’s language development progress,  their child’s English language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas. Also  present at the meeting is a qualified interpreter/translator in the language or mode of communication the parent or guardian  best understands.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Here at PS 95, we are constatly thinking up ways to involve parents, as we value them as a part of our community.  We also  understand the need to assist our ELL parents in acquiring the English language so they can help their children at home.  All  activities for parents are coordinated in conjunction with our PTA, parent coordinator, and other staff members.  One of our  most important parent workshops we plan to continue are the weekly ELL parent workshops, which have been running for  about 12 years now.  These weekly workshops came about as a result of the high population of non-English speaking parents,  and is run by our parent coordinator, who is bilingual.  At these workshops, parents get training in learning the English  language, both grammatical and functional.  They will also create academic games which they can take home and use with  their children, as well as learn useful tips and strategies for helping their children.  It has proven to be a worthwhile learning  experience for all parents who attend, and we are thrilled to be able to continue this very successful program. Our parent  coordinator is also beginning to hold weekly workshops on the Common Core Learning Standards, EChalk, an online tool which  keeps our parents informed of all the happenings in our school.  We post parent notifications on this site and it instantly  translates the information into various languages at the click of a button, which allows us to communicate with our ELL  population.  This also ensures equity to all our ELL parents.  The parent coordinator will also provide regular workshops for  parents on using ARIS, so parents can be kept abreast of their child's academic progress.  Speakers from various community  outreach programs are scheduled to come to our school to inform our parents on topics including asthma, stress management,  Internet safety, and parenting skills. These workshops are scheduled throughout the year.  Our ELL parents will continue  to  take part in multicultural celebrations at our school, as well as various celebrations we have throughout the school  year.  Parents are invited up periodically to celebrate their children's’ academic achievements and to appreciate their work in  the Arts. We are planning a Literacy, Mathematics, Science, Fitness and Art Family Fun night, which offer all our parents an  opportunity to bond with their children and become a bigger part of our school community. In addition, The Office of Family  Engagement forwards information to our parent coordinator on wonderful cultural workshops and opportunities in our  community and city for our ELL parents. Our parent coordinator then sends the information out to the parents, encouraging  them to take advantage and attend. Every parent in our school was invited up to the school to meet their child's teacher and  have an opportunity to hear what the curriculum for the year would be.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Janet Ndzibah, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          77                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   P.S.95                                                                              School DBN: 21k095  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      We conducted our assessment of language preferences of the parent community for both written and oral  communication by using our ELL demographics data, as well as surveying parents to find out in what language  they would prefer to receive information from the school. This information is indicated on page two of the Home  Language Identification Survey (HLIS) which every parent is mandated to complete upon school registration. We  also ask our classroom teachers to report which materials they felt would be beneficial to have translated into  various languages represented in their classroom community.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          79     2.
