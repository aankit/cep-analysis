This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The PS/MS 219 Learning Community promises to do our best to provide rigorous instruction and cultural engagement.  We also promise to cultivate a learning and social environment where the whole child is supported.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   We are committed to a deep sense of social justice here at PS/MS 219. We maximize exposure to every single cultural  experience fiscally and physically possible. The 219 version of social justice is that we provide max participation of all  the cultural goodies that NYC has to offer. They shouldn't be reserved for affluent tourists and residents. We think it's  a travesty when our students live next to cultural icons and cannot access them. We take everybody. Before we called  this list, the "Bucket List," we wanted every student to go to the Metropolitan Museum. Now we have expanded this  expectation to the Whitney and the Guggenheim. We have made a new ASD connection with the Guggenheim for our  Horizon classes. We have implemented many social, cultural and academic experiences that are outside the classroom  such as: Overnight trips to Washington, D.C., and Boston, as well as a day trip to Philadelphia. The following Bucket  List is an extensive – but not exhaustive – list of the incredible layers of what we give our kids.  Tae Kwon Do: PreK – Grade 1   Going to a Broadway Show: Grade 5   Swimming at the YMCA of Flushing: Grade 2  Day Trip - Philadelphia: Grade 6   Mets Game at Citi Field: Grade 3   Overnight Trip - Boston: Grade 7   Ballroom Dance: Grade 4   Overnight Trip - Washington, DC: Grade 8      Another example of this concept of equity access is how we treat the 8th Grade Prom, and we have seen an easily  measurable impact: 100% participation. This is possible because we hold the event on-site during the day, preventing  the exclusion of students who are on door-to-door busing, which makes attending events problematic, and/or  religious observers who would not normally participate in a male-female event. Our parents support this idea because  they trust the school to provide a socially healthy and culturally acceptable prom experience. There is no charge to  the students and it is an extremely popular event. This is just one of many examples.   Regents for All   PSMS 219 offers the Common Core Algebra I Regents as well as the Earth Science Regents to all General Education  and ICT students in 8th grade via a two-year model. Students with disabilities in the 8:1:1 (Horizon) and 12:1 (self- contained) classes can take the Regents if they are up to the challenge of the rigor. We do not have “SP” or “Advanced  Placement” classes; rather our classes are heterogeneously-grouped and we do not isolate our “self-contained”  classes in any way. All students therefore have access to rigorous instruction in the core subjects. No other MS  schools within the district offer the Regents to such a wide range of students. In doing so, we have improved our  service to the community and now have 300+ families on our MS choice waiting list: an increase from years ago when  we experienced an annual challenge to fill our grade six seats. Our parents and students know that not everyone  passes the Regents because both tests are extremely hard but they continue to choose PS/MS 219 for the opportunity  to pass the exam. They trust us to provide the best possible instruction to their students to give them an opportunity  to try. Parents and students understand and appreciate the connection to college and career readiness. (Statistics  show that not all students pass the Regents but rigorous instruction and support provides the opportunity to attempt  to be successful on the Regents.) We are currently in the process of adding a Geometry Regents class for some of our  accelerated students and are considering American History Regents in the 2018 – 2019 school year.   STEM and Science   To increase STEM in our classrooms, we offer Bricks 4 Kidz (a version of Lego Robotics) to our students in grades 1 – 7.  Classes cycle through units of Lego work and coding to create tools used in the world around them! We also created a  Maker Club from a partnership between Nest and the New York Hall of Science. Our students design their own  creations and build them with our 3D printer!   SciCon! We used an inquiry approach to evaluate our annual Science Fair Projects. Our Science department asked:  How can we improve the rigor and success, improve content, create a “burn” for inquiry, foster curiosity, and improve  fidelity to the Scientific Method? Where do we want students to land? Where do we want teachers to land? From   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      there, we revamped our traditional science fair to include many more opportunities for STEM. We found that  traditional science projects do not always cater to students’ strengths. We want to provide all students with access  points to STEM, generating excitement about the world around us. We gave students give options for a science  projects:     Traditional Science Experiment: Students will state a research question that can be answered through   observation or experimentation.  Scientific Principle Demonstrated and Explained       Use Legos to Demonstrate a Scientific Principle, tool, idea, etc.    Create Your Own Invention for Society     Scientist Contributions: Write a report on an invention or scientist's contributions and its impact on our  society.   We gave students scientific journals to jot down their notes, background information, research drawings, hypotheses,  ideas, etc. Students would also produce a written report where they would share their findings, research, and  information learned. We were open to all formats: PowerPoints, written reports, comic strips, art projects, etc.   Art and Music   We have two complete Pre-K – 8 teams for Art and for Music. Our three art teachers develop curriculum across the  grade bands, PreK – 8. Our Pk-1 Enrichment Model offers arts in a way that supplements the students’ other curricula  based on Engage NY domains. Students with Disabilities (SWDs) who have emotional and sensory needs (K & 1st  Grade Horizon classes) that are not sometimes met, enjoy enrichment taught via a therapeutic approach that uses  strategies from speech, occupational therapy (OT), and physical therapy (PT) to help all of our youngest kids meet  their needs. Students in grades 2 - 5 learn print making, graphic design, and creative arts. Our MS art teacher is Nest  trained and meets the NYC and State requirements for the visual arts. Students visit Whitney Museum, the  Metropolitan Museum of Art, and more! Our fourth Annual School-Wide Art show was very popular with our families.  Our new Chorus traveled to New Jersey to perform in the American Young Voices concert, along with over 1 million  other students.   Our three music teachers continue to develop our music curriculum across the grades, Pre-K to Grade 8. Students  learn the foundation of music in Pre-K – 2, start learning the recorder and guitar in grade 3 – 6, and in grades 7 & 8  students choose band instruments. We offer an after-school band and orchestra club to students in grades 4 - 6. Each  grade had a Spring Concert, performing in front of families and staff with guitars, keyboards, drums, band  instruments, orchestra, etc. This year, we have three full-time music teachers and a chorus for students in grades 5 -  8! We build pull-out small group instruction into our music teachers' programs. They get small group instruction via  tutoring with their musical instruments. Our music and art classes are not electives so these built-in periods are  necessary to engage high level skill. 100% of students take music. 100% of students take art. We are not an elite  school; rather, this is evidence of full inclusion for all our students.   Mentoring, Career Day, and Corporate Partnerships   Middle School age children are presented with mentoring and guest visits from corporate partners such as  Bloomingdale’s, New York Community Bank, and several New York sports teams (Yankees, Mets, Knicks, Nets, Giants,  and Jets). Our partnership with the NY Pops provides families with free tickets to concerts at Carnegie Hall. Other city- based educational programs include visits from the Department of Emergency Management (DOEM) and the FDNY.  This year, we hosted Career Day with over 15 guest presenters speaking about their careers and how they became  successful.   Family Engagement and Involvement   Through our increase in parent involvement, we have numerous activities catered to bring parents into the building.  We have Student of the Month once each month where we celebrate students and their hard work and achievement.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      Other parent activities include: graduation, stepping up ceremonies, SciCon, Art Show, music concerts, Lunar New  Year, Cool Culture, and Family Engagement Night.   We’re green! We have extensive outdoor space with raspberries, figs, and a full apple orchard. We have raised bed  garden plots that grow tomatoes, herbs, and more. We also compost all the organic waste from the school cafeteria  and nearly 100% of all the carbon waste, our shredded paper. The compost is then used to condition our soil around  the school.   We continue to hire more staff members who speak a variety of languages! We have staff who speak: Mandarin,  Spanish, Cantonese, Greek, Hebrew, Russian, Hindi, and more!      That’s 219 at its best.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   We offer early morning, after school, and school-break academies for our students! Our ESN students attend "Sunrise  Academy" to prepare them for the NYSESLAT. Students in grades 3 - 8 attend a "Sunrise Academy" for test  preparation for the state exams. Additionally, we offer test preparation programs during the vacations (February and  April) for extra help in getting ready for the state exams.   We must highlight our two programs for children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Students on the spectrum  are served in two discrete programs: Nest (20:5 ICT) in Middle School and Horizon (8:1:1) in K-8. We have always been  a school that embraces all children: those with needs, those who are learning English, and those who are neuro- typical. We believe in inclusive education; students are mainstreamed as much as possible and have equitable access  to all subjects, activities, and programs. We tailor instruction and have positive behavior supports for all students,  especially those with special needs. Because of our success with these programs, the Office of Specialized Programs  has asked us to create a specialized PreK for students with ASD in a 6:1:2 setting. We are so proud, so grateful, and so  humbled to serve another group in the community.   Our ASD programs provide professional development centered on training school teams to support the ASD students  at their individual education levels no matter what. We already had many of the strategies to serve Students with  Disabilities; certainly we had the heart and the dedication in place already. These two programs have helped us to  provide structures and establish new and better-organized bottom lines for our classrooms and to adjust attitudes  and actions of those who serve them. Our teams are provided with intensive on- and off-site support for not only the  teachers, but related service providers and administration, as well. Because of the high quality of the strategies, team  meeting protocols, and other supports, many elements and philosophies have been incorporated across the school  and in all classrooms. Any visitor or evaluator will see evidence of this improvement of our school-wide PBIS-like  methods and classroom supports. All of which support not only the social needs but ultimately help our ASD kids to  have a chance to learn like everyone else in a community school setting.   Some of the Nest and Horizon specific supports are: Perspectives Lab, the Independence Curriculum, and Case  Conferencing. Perspectives Lab (Social Development Intervention) is a class taught by Speech teachers that works on  pragmatic language and perspective taking skills. The Independence Curriculum is a program focusing on executive  functioning that our Occupational Therapist does with 6th grade Nest students. Both Horizon and Nest students are  case conferenced during team meetings (three times each month) where teachers discuss students' strengths and  challenges and brainstorm ways to support our students with their independent needs. This is an opportunity for  teachers to brainstorm and problem solve challenges and struggles - both academic and behavioral – in the  classroom. Moreover, Horizon and Nest teachers participate in inter-visitation to share best practices and see their  colleagues engage in similar content or with the same students across grade levels.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   This past year, we have made the most progress in Effective School Leadership, Rigorous Instruction, and Strong  Family-Community Ties.     One example that displays our rigorous instruction is that 76% of our 8th graders passed the Algebra Regents;   this is inclusive of Nest and Horizon students. 81% of our 8th graders passed the Earth Science Regents,  inclusive of all Nest and Horizon students.     Additionally, on our 2017-2018 School Learning Survey:   o  97% of families say they trust the principal.  o  93% of families say that the principal at their school works hard to build trusting relationships with   families like them.    o  99% of families say that they feel respected by their child's teachers.    Our key area of focus for 2018 – 2019 will be on teacher teams (QR 4.2), aligned to Collaborative Teachers in the  Framework for Great Schools.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 25Q219   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05,06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   642   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

In the 2017 - 2018 school year, we had an overall 118 number of OORS incidents. 70% of those incidents  were infraction levels 3, 4, and 5.   We have strong structures in place to support students with a wide variety of needs. The problem is that these  incidents arise and need to be addressed through interventions and restorative process before they escalate into full- on disciplinary problems. This disconnect has been observed through various power struggles and acts of defiance,  even in classrooms where staff has training as well as other areas within the building where the staff has yet to  implement the same high-quality structures and supports.

As aligned to the Framework for Great Schools' Collaborative Teachers element, we reviewed our MOLP feedback  (June 2018) for Teacher Teams (Proficient). The feedback was, "Engage your curriculum team in looking at your math  curricula, particularly the transfer of standards into key learning objectives and essential questions to increase rigor,  specifically in looking at productive struggle in math. Tools like the Tri-State rubric and the Next Generation standards  can be used to ensure that your teacher teams revisit units of study through a common lens."   Additional feedback stated that teachers need to "routinely plan for and implement rich academic tasks that promote  discussions that reflect high levels of student thinking, participation and ownership of learning, especially in  mathematics and science."   Given that feedback, the work we did in the 2017 -2018 school year around Rich Tasks in Math, Science, and Social  Studies, and our scores from the NYS Math exam, we noticed that we do not currently have consistent rich tasks in  math. Teachers are relying on the Envision teaching materials and needed support in modifying tasks aligned to the  district-wide Rich Task Checklist.

Our PPO QR 1.2 (Proficient) feedback was: “It is important to revisit your professional learning plan, as teachers may  need supports with the “productive struggle” element of your school-wide instructional focus. How should  “productive struggle” influence the design of your tasks?"   Our Quality Review QR 1.2 (Proficient) feedback was: "Teaching strategies consistently provide multiple entry points  into the curricula; however, there are missed opportunities to provide strategic extensions."   Our school-wide instructional focus is on creating small groups for instruction around data.

We will continue to leverage the school’s ability to engage in structured  professional collaborations on teams using an inquiry approach that promotes shared leadership and focuses on  improved student learning. Based on analysis of Advance data, data gathered via classroom observations by  administrators, feedback conversations with teachers, and analysis of student performance/progress, staff members  need differentiated and targeted professional development in 1e, 3c, and 3d. Improvement of teaching practices  translates to improvement of the quality of instruction our students receive by setting goals based on individual  results.

As aligned to the Framework For Great Schools' Strong Family and Community Ties and Trust elements, we have  analyzed the school's learning environment survey data:     94% of families say that school staff regularly communicate with them about how families can help their child   learn.      98% of families say that teachers work closely with them to meet their child's needs. (Q1d)    95% of families say that they feel well-informed by the communications they receive from their school.    89% of families say that they are likely to attend a general school meeting or school event. (Q6a)    97% of families say that they are likely to go to a regularly scheduled parent-teacher conference with their   child's teacher.     98% of families say that they feel respected by their child's principal. (Q1i)    97% of families say that they trust the principal. (Q1j)    95% of families say that the principal is an effective manager who makes the school run smoothly. (Q1k)    93% of families say that the principal at their school works hard to build trusting relationships with families   like them.     99% of families say that they feel respected by their child's teachers. (Q1f)    97% of families say that school staff work hard to build trusting relationships with families like them. (Q1g)    100% of families say that teachers and families think of each other as partners in educating children.   Our Well Developed on the Quality Review was indicator 3.4 High Expectations. Feedback was: "School leaders  consistently communicate high expectations and provide training to the entire staff. School leaders and staff  effectively communicate expectations connected to a path to college and career readiness. Impact School leaders  provide professional learning connected to school wide expectations and there is a culture of mutual accountability  connected to observation feedback. Information sharing and communicating through verbal and written reports with  families results in supporting students in their academic progress   Additional analysis of the 2017-2018 Learning Environment Survey, Parent Teacher Sign Ins, and the other family  engagement activities reveals that the school shows successful interactions and events for families. Positive feedback  from the Survey and verbal feedback strengthens our ties with our families and motivates us to improve the  experience of being a PS/MS 219 parent.

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  The school utilizes every NYCDOE support to recruit new teachers such as the Open Market and the Teacher Finder.  We often get teachers from other Horizon schools who are ABA or BCBA trained or certified. The school also develops  extensive professional networking to spread the notice of any and all openings in the school. Each candidate is  thoroughly evaluated for their credentials, experience, and “fit” for the assignment. Interviewing teachers give demo  lessons and reflect on feedback. The teachers and administration work hand in hand to discuss and plan for  appropriate assignments for teachers that match up experience and expertise with student need.       Where support in the form of professional learning is required, the school works together to seek out and implement  the support necessary for teachers to succeed in the classroom. We partner with NYU Nest and the ASD Office for  Horizon for professional development for our teachers. We also use Teachers College staff developers to work with  our teachers on coaching in Readers and Writers Workshops. Our consultant from GoldMansour & Rutherford works  with our special education teachers on individual supports for struggling students and ICT co-teaching models. Our  Nest and Horizon teachers case conference students to create supports and structures that maximize student  achievement and success. Additionally, our ENL teachers attend District 25 ELL professional development sessions to  optimize strategies in the classroom for our ELLs. Every Friday, new teachers meet to go over best practices, the  Danielson rubric, classroom expectations, and discussion and engagement strategies. Our teachers learn from one  another through inter-visitations and are supported whether they are new or veteran to the building.        2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   The progress the school has made as evidenced by the Quality Review and student achievement gains on the NYS ELA  and math exams, can be attributed to the high-quality, focused professional development that supports teaching  from Common Core aligned curriculum and Advance feedback. Professional Development comes from various areas:  Teachers College Staff Developers, a consultant with GoldMansour & Rutherford who works with our Special  Education Teachers, RTI Professional Development with the American Institutes for Research, Nest and Horizon  coaches, and more.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44         We also provide professional development to paraprofessionals and related service providers through our  partnerships with Nest and Horizon. Any staff member who works with Horizon students (teacher, paraprofessional,  therapist, etc.) gets trained in ReThink - an online encyclopedia of lessons and data collection based on students'  specific needs. Related Service providers work with Nest consultants on best practices for students with ASD and  other learning challenges. Our paraprofessionals get 1:1 support from our Horizon coach. This year, we are lucky  enough to have 5 Lead Teacher Assistants (advanced-level paras). Social workers and guidance counselors go to  trainings hosted by NYU.       Our school's administration gets support and professional development through District 25 professional learning  teams as well as the NYU Nest and ASD Office. We are also getting social emotional training on the Ruler Method at  Yale University.        Part 3: TA Schools Only   3a. Use of Program Resources   Describe how the TA program resources will assist participating children to meet proficiency.  n/a        3b. TA Coordination with the Regular Program   Describe the planning, coordination and support of the TA program with the regular educational program (i.e.,  providing ELT, accelerated, high-quality curriculum, including applied learning; and minimize removing children from  the regular classroom during regular school day).  n/a                Part 4: SWP Schools Only   4a. Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).     Since the school is a K-8 with Pre-K, our students and families have extremely smooth transitions. Records are easily  transitioned from PreK to Kindergarten at the end of the school year. Stepping up ceremonies, Open Houses and  many other parent-involvement activities are conducted throughout the year. Also, because the Pre-K classes are  included in all of the regular K-8 activities by grade bands such as school dances, Student of the Month and others,  transitions are not an issue. Our Pre-K Social Worker actively supports all social and emotional issues for our Pre-K  students. They may come to her via teacher recommendations, parent referrals, or simply by classroom observations.  Our Speech and Language teachers and OTs often do informal observations and work with our PreK teachers to  support our students in need. Our Parent Coordinator (PC) sets up 10 to 12 events every year where Community   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      Based Organization’s present their services or products to our parents; all parents are invited for all events. The PC  also works closely with our PreK Social Worker. They plan parent and facilitate workshops together. If a family needs  early intervention, we work relentlessly for them to get these supports.      Pre-K teachers attend the same types of professional development as the rest of the staff; they are observed and  given feedback. They work on the Pre-K Units of Study as a collaborative team and develop centers and questions for  each unit. These teachers get feedback aligned to the CLASS system as well as ECERS. They collect data on their  students using Work Sampling and share their students' portfolios with the new Kindergarten teachers at the end of  the school year.           4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     The Professional Development Committee, the MOSL Committee and Inquiry Teams have been meeting and planning  for several years developing formative assessments. Much progress was made in the design and use of rubrics in ELA,  math, and Social Studies. We are working on adding rubrics to everyday classroom teaching and learning in art, music,  gym, Mandarin, and science. ELA teachers across grades K- 8 participated in the TC Writing Pathways System training  to learn about assessment best practices. There is a school-wide core belief that students learn best when they have  excellent modeling, time to engage in the discussion of what they think and how they solve problems. Across  classrooms in the major subjects and now art, PE, Mandarin and technology, students use checklists and rubrics as  learning tools, not solely as a scoring tool. The school uses a four-point rubric scale where “three” means proficient or  grade-level mastery.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS/MS 219, in compliance with the ESSA (The Every Student Succeeds Act  (ESSA) was signed by President Obama on December 10, 2015. This measure reauthorizes the 50-year-old ESSA, Every  Student Succeeds Act, which replaces and updates the No Child Left Behind, NCLB Act) is responsible for creating and  implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement  between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving  them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to  actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained  volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   PS/MS 219 will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, ESSA;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.         School-Parent Compact (SPC)      School-Parent Compact (SPC)   PS/MS 219 , in compliance with the Title 1, ESSA, is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the  connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. Staff and parents of students  participating in activities and programs funded by Title I, agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire  school staff and students will share responsibility for improved academic achievement and the means by which a  school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51            Provide high quality curriculum and instruction consistent with Common Core State Standards to enable participating  children to meet the State’s Standards and Assessments by:   I.

This before-school program serves a dual purpose; it strives to  provide students with tasks that support speaking, listening, reading and writing skills as well as  to provide test sophistication for the NYSESLAT exam by acquainting the students with the  testing format that will be presented to them in the spring. Another rationale for the program is  that it will support our school’s Instructional Focus: Professional Learning Teams will analyze  data and track student progress, which will result in rigorous and engaging small group  instruction.  The Sunrise Academy will be designed to have cycles within where students are flexibly grouped  not only by grade band, but also by English proficiency level, and home language for native  language support. These cycles supplement the daily instruction that students receive from 8:10  AM – 2:30 PM. Four of the nine ENL teachers (all TESOL Certified) teaching in the Sunrise  Academy are also bilingual and will support students in their home language (predominantly  Chinese and Spanish) via the use of texts that foster the use of all four areas-listening, speaking,  reading and writing. All K-8 ENL students, across all proficiency levels from entering to  expanding, are invited to attend the Sunrise Academy. The program's duration is approximately  10 weeks from mid January to mid May. The program is scheduled from 7:10 AM to 8:10 AM  every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. All Sunrise Academy Teachers are certified in  TESOL. The students in the Sunrise Academy Program, are provided with a copy of "Getting  Ready for the NYSESLAT" published by Attanasio and Associates, Inc. All of the materials are  supplemental and distinct from those used for daily instruction.  We will provide academic support to approximately 103 NYSESLAT eligible students and 51  commanding non-eligible NYSESLAT students throughout the school day. For students that  performed on either the “entering” or “emerging” levels on the NYSESLAT (NYSITELL for  new admits) they will receive 360 ENL embedded instructional minutes weekly. Of the 360  minutes, 180 minutes will be stand-alone instruction (small group) and the remaining 180  minutes will be integrated instruction (team-teaching, flexible grouping, and/or parallel  teaching). For students that performed on either the “transitioning” or “expanding” levels on the  NYSESLAT (NYSITELL for new admits) the students will be instructed by an integrated model  (team-teaching, flexible grouping, and/or parallel teaching) for 180 minutes weekly. Lastly,  those students who performed on the “commanding” level on the NYSESLAT will have 90  minutes of integrated ENL instruction (team teaching, alternative teaching for enrichment, and/or  parallel teaching) weekly.   Our English Language Learner student subgroups are as followed: * In kindergarten, we have  approximately 6 entering ENL students, 8 emerging student, 6 transitioning students and 3  expanding students. * In 1st grade, we will provide support to 1 emerging student, 2 transitioning  student, 11 expanding students, and 7 commanding students. * In 2nd grade, we have  approximately 1 entering student, 1 emerging student, 5 transitioning students, 6 expanding  students, and 12 commanding students. * In the third grade, academic assistance will be provided  to 1 entering student, 1 emerging student, 11 expanding students, and 13 commanding students. *  In 4th grade, we have approximately 4 transitioning students, 8 expanding students, and 6   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57         Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   commanding students. * In the 5th grade, we have 1 entering ENL students, 2 emerging students,  1 transitioning student, 7 expanding students and 8 commanding students. * In the 6th grade, we  have 1 entering student, 3 transitioning students, 5 expanding students, and 1 commanding  student. * In the 7th grade, we have 1 entering student, 1 transitioning student, 3 expanding  students and 1 commanding student. * Lastly, in the 8th grade, we have 3 expanding student and  1 commanding students.  In addition to the Sunrise Academy, ENL students are encouraged to attend additional programs  during the school breaks (mid-winter and spring recess). These programs include 2 days during  the mid-winter break and 3 days during the spring recess break (for a total of 5 days). The  additional programs will be scheduled for 3 hours each day 9:00 AM – 12:00 PM (15 hours per  school year) and provide additional support for high academic achievement in ELA, Math, and  other core academic areas. In addition, these programs support the rigor behind the NEXT  Generation Standards, reading for stamina, and test sophistication for the NYS Common Core  exams. Students have opportunities to engage in book clubs, partner/peer conferences, guided  reading and math groups, centers/stations, and inquiry lessons. The sessions will be divided in  two equal parts, and hour and a half of literacy and an hour and a half of math. Students will be  grouped by grade and/or level (as identified by RtI screening tools and formative assessments).  Resources used during these recess academies will include: Scholastic Leveled Books, NY  Ready Test Prep by Curriculum Associates, NEWSELA on the iPad and laptop, and common  core aligned Scholastic Magazines- Storyworks Jr., Storyworks and Scope. Our DIBELS  Assessments as well as Fountas and Pinnell Assessment Tools (Running Records and Concepts  of Print Assessments) reveal an assortment of quantitative data. Patterns are as follow in grades  K-2: the need is in supporting students in the early stages of emergent reading; matching letters  and sounds, identifying sight words and tackling tricky words. Patterns are as follow in grades 3- 8: synthesizing details from the text in longer more complex texts, thinking within and beyond  the text, and tackling figurative language/vocabulary. Both the Sunrise Academy and recess  programs will recruit participation from the eligible 103 ENL students across grades K-8 and  will strive to tackle the needs described above.  Parents will have access to translated ELA rubrics and checklists in Spanish. We are currently in  the process of having those documents translated to Chinese. All students will be provided with a  bilingual glossary for classroom and home use. In addition, our NEWS ELA program has an  option to translate assigned texts to Spanish.

Professional Development supports not only ENL strategies but also the rigor and  curriculum of the general education population (since all of the ENL teachers are dually certified  in ENL and either Common Branches or Special Education). PD opportunities include weekly  Common Planning with grade level teams, weekly school-based Monday Professional  Development, at least three cycles Teachers College staff development/lab sites for a total of 10  sessions, a bi-monthly Team study group during the Tuesday collaboration time specifically   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      Part C: Professional Development   about Advance and the Danielson Framework as it relates to best teaching practices for ELLs, as  well as any other workshops provided from the NYC DOE specifically for ELLs. Topics also  include: supporting academic literacy, meeting the rigor of the CCLS, transitioning to the Next  Generation Standards, RTI Screening Tools, Reading and writing performance assessments/tasks  (TC Reading and Writing Pathways), increasing the rigor of reading conferences through  Fountas and Pinnell's Literacy Continuum, standards-based rubrics and analysis of student work  to track progress (across the Writing Pathways checklists and Reading Pathways learning  progressions) and developing multiple entry points, understanding text complexity, informational  texts and shared reading comprehension strategies, and learning integrated co-teaching models.  All teachers maintain their own personal Professional Development Log (as listed and described  in our PSMS 219Q Faculty Handbook) which at the end of the school year we collect and  maintain on file. Agendas and attendance sheets are also maintained on file by teachers and  administrators.   All consultants and PD providers (TC Staff Developers, BFSC presenters,  coaches, G & R Consultants, Administrators, etc.) are either ESL certified or have had extensive  training in servicing ENL students The TC PDs aim to support our ENL teachers by highlighting  essential methods, tools, and principles that will guide us in adapting the reading and writing  workshop approach. In addition, PDs will be designed to help us think about how partnerships,  language rehearsal, and vocabulary play an important role in reading and writing workshops.  Teachers will learn to use formative assessments of language and literacy (performance  assessments and learning progressions) to set goals and design instruction that will help propel  and promote language development in the classroom. Teachers will use their writing units of  study to support these sessions and mentor texts at different levels. Teachers will consider the  many ways to help students remain on a steady trajectory of growth using goals, personal charts,  checklists, rubrics. The PDs also support teachers in how to develop and use language goals for  reading and writing, as well as how to create charts and tools that are effective even for our  newest English language speakers. Because of these workshops, teachers will learn how to  transform their literacy block by developing teaching tools and methods like read alouds, topic  baggies, listening centers, and interactive writing books that become reading books. Teachers  will be able to formulate and pose research-based, scaffolded questions in their conferences, so  that our ELLs will be able to form increasingly informative answers. Lastly, in these workshops  our ENL Teachers will learn how to create an environment that encourages academic discourse  in classrooms by reading current research and discussing best practices. Also, they will learn to  identify and adapt resources to assess academic language development using practical tools to  monitor progress. Participants will use the New York State Bilingual Common Core Initiative  and Specific Considerations for ELLs Guidance document as a planning guide to meet the needs  of ELLs in the class, with specific focus on 3b: Discussion and Questioning Techniques.    Specific TC PD Titles and Dates, in addition to the Monday and Tuesday PD times/topics listed  above, are: 9/25/18- Say Hello To TCRWP’s New Phonics Workshop Curriculum  (Kindergarten); 9/25/18- Join Us in Welcoming a New Member of the Family: Phonics Units of  Study for First Grade; 10/11- Spelling Based Approaches to Phonics; 10/11- Teaching Grammar  in Context: Practical, Writerly Instruction to Support Student Growth and Engagement;  11/5- Supporting Students in Beginning Stages of Language Acquisition; 11/13- Provide  Culturally Relevant Teaching and Opportunities for Language Development within Your  Reading and Writing Workshop; 12/17- Using Assessments to Drive Your Phonics Instruction  and Your Small Group Work: A Mini-Unit to Be Sure Your Youngsters Grasp the Phonics and  High-Frequency Words They Most Need; 2/26- Support Students Learning English as a New  Language Navigate Nonfiction Texts: Building Academic Language and Strengthening  Comprehension Skills; Specialty Group Series 9/14, 10/15, 12/21, 1/11, 2/14- How Can We  Bring Small Group Work that Supports Phonics Across Reading and Writing Workshops and  Learn from Those Small Groups When Leading Others?; Three Day Institute 1/14-1/16- The  Power and Risk of Scaffolds for English Language Learners Institute; Three Day Institute- 2/18-  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59         Part C: Professional Development   2/20- Reading Toolkits. The rigor reflected from the professional developments will help expand  the student’s oral, written, reading and listening skills.     As described above, all ENL staff members, including those leading professional development,  will receive on-going professional learning development from our Teachers College consultants  and DELLS support staff (Queens North PLOs). Our staff has signed up for specific workshops  such as: Teaching Advanced Literacy Skills to ELLs: Deep Dive Series (6-12) - Building Written  Language for ELLs; Teaching Advanced Literacy Skills to ELLs: Deep Dive Series (6-12) -  Implementing Structured Academic Discussions in ENL Classrooms; Teaching Advanced  Literacy Skills to ELLs: Deep Dive Series (K-5) - Building Written Language for ELLs ; Teaching Advanced Literacy Skills to ELLs: Deep Dive Series (K-5) - Implementing  Structured Academic Discussions in ENL Classrooms ; and Teaching Advanced Literacy Skills  to ELLs: Foundational Series.

NOTE: These are in addition to mandated activities, such as  parent orientation during ELL identification process.     rationale       schedule and duration      name of provider    how parents will be notified of these activities   topics to be covered   Begin description here:             Families of ENL students are invited to engage in conversations regarding their child's progress  during several open-houses throughout the school year including: Meet the Teacher Night in  September, Parent/Teacher conferences in November and March, and Passport Night in May;  workshops to develop English Language skills, trips, celebrations and special events, and  Monthly Parent Association meetings. Families are also encouraged to bring their children and  participate in family night activities following every Student of the Month (September – June)  ceremony hosted by the Parent Association (every last Tuesday of the month). In addition, we  offer an information session for ENL parents in March to acquaint the parents with the  NYSESLAT exam. All events are posted on our school website http://psms219.org (which has a  language link to translate the site in over 100 languages), are translated in multiple languages on  letters sent home, and are recorded in multiple languages via home voice messages.  In order to  comply with the changes from CR-154 our staff will provide a 1:1 parent conference to discuss  their child's progress. During this informative session, the teachers will explain the child's  English language proficiency assessment results. In this meeting, the parents receive an  individualized packet including: a sample test of the NYSESLAT from ENGAGENY.ORG, a  print out of the child's progress from DIBELS Next (K-2) or i-Ready (3-8) which emphasize  strengths and areas of need in literacy and math, and on-demand writing assignments along with  a graded common core aligned rubric. The individualized meeting will occur during the school  day with interpreters to assist the teachers. As a result, of our parent interviews, meetings, and  surveys our staff has effectively evaluated the needs of our ENL parents. Staff and the parent  coordinator assist in this. This data inspired us to include more parent involvement activities. For  example, the majority of our parents asked for English classes along with how to help their child  with academics. Therefore, we will continue our partnership with the Center for Integrated  Teacher Education (CITE) to provide 14 sessions (7 in the morning and 7 in the afternoon)  which provide group instruction for ENL parents. The goal of this program is to familiarize ENL  parents with everyday English in order to navigate the community easier. Furthermore, our ENL  Teachers will provide monthly family workshops starting in the month of November outlining   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    the Common Core Standards (to identify benchmarks and track progress), navigating the Pearson  Realize Math website, and  strategies to help child's literacy development (in reading and  writing). We will incorporate parent-child homework assistance sessions, where the ENL  teachers will provide direct opportunities for parents to do homework assignments with their  child in the company of and explanation by a teacher. This will occur on a monthly basis, for one  hour, every other month of school. We will also recruit parent liaisons, bilingual parents within  our school community who would like to volunteer to work alongside the ENL teachers to  support parents of ELLs. All of these activities are year-long cycles. Lastly, at the start of the  school year, on October 12th, the Assistant Principals and ENL teachers facilitated a workshop  for families titled "Being an Involved Parent." The workshop focused on families as learners and  provided parents/guardians with clarity on the curriculum grade level benchmarks and learning  tools they could use at home to further support their child. A survey was collected at the end of  the workshop, as in all workshops, and we gathered data that reflects additional interest in  "learning" parent workshops. Therefore, the "Being an Involved Parent" workshop will become a  year-long series. Note:  In addition to the TESOL certified teachers, our Parent Coordinator  speaks and writes in Spanish. She will  be an asset when translating and bridging community  relationships between the staff and parents. Lastly, the newly elected PA President is also  bilingual (Spanish) and will assist in translations and promote strong neighborhood affairs.  Phone messages and letters home are translated, which parents also requested. We also use an  interpretation system with headsets and transmitters that support simultaneous interpretation in a  variety of languages during assemblies, workshops and meetings. "Town Hall" style meetings  utilize simultaneous translators for Spanish, Chinese, and Russian speaking parents. Interpreters  are used for Parent Teacher Conferences. Records of agendas, attendance sheets and invitations  in parents' preferred languages are kept on file in our ENL Binder which is maintained in the  main office, for access to all.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?    Our school uses the Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark System (K-8) as the assessment tool to assess the literacy skills of our  ELLs.  The assessment, which includes running records, provides insight into our ELLs reading knowledge of concepts of print,  accuracy, fluency and comprehension.  The miscue analysis informs our instruction. We analyze whether the child is making  meaning-based, syntactic, or visual miscues as they read. Specifically, this information helps inform our school’s instructional  plan because teachers modify the components of Balanced Literacy as needed to meet these needs. For example, apart from  the direct instruction provided via Readers and Writers Workshop, literacy strategies are further embedded in shared reading,  interactive writing, read aloud, guided reading, word study, conferences, etc.    Another tool our school uses to assess all of the  primary grade students (K-2), including our ELLs, is DIBELS Next. DIBELS is an assessment/screening tool used to measure the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64      acquisition of early literacy skills from kindergarten through sixth grade. DIBELS helps to identify students who may be at risk  for reading difficulties (via universal screening); helps teachers identify areas to target instructional support; and helps to  monitor at-risk students while they receive additional, targeted instruction.We also implement the Teachers College Reading  and Writing Pathways System across grades K-8 as an assessment to guide instructional planning for our ELLs,. There are pre  and post reading and writing assessments that students take across each unit of study which are used as a means to assess  reading and writing progress. The Informational and Narrative Reading Learning Progressions as well as the Narrative,  Information and Opinion/Argument Writing Learning Progressions are used afterwards as learning tools.    Analyzing the NYSESLAT and NYSITELL results, our staff noticed that we have approximately 12.8% of our ENL population  performing at an "entering" level, 12.8% on an "emerging" level, 22.2% on a "transitioning" level and 52% on an "expanding"  level. The state data shows that our instruction for our lower grades (predominantly performing on the "entering" and  "emerging" levels) need to strategically be focused on the introduction and application of new words and phrases throughout  all 4 modalities. Meanwhile, in our intermediate grades the majority of the ENL population is performing on an "expanding"  level. While further interpreting the data, staff noticed that our intermediate grade ENL students performed significantly lower  in the writing modality compared to the other 3 modalities. Targeted instruction using the performance indicators and CCLS  will guide teachers for student progression.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   We designate three formal assessment windows as structures to support the effort of assessment-driven  instruction.  Specifically, the Fountas and Pinnell Reading Assessments are conducted three times a year- BOY, MOY and  EOY.  The DIBELS Next Screening tool is also conducted separately, during this same time frame.  Once the assessments and  screenings have been conducted, all of the teachers (classroom teachers, ENL teachers, reading intervention/LLI teacher, IEP  teacher, RTI team, and assistant principals) analyze the data. The focus is on identifying trends and patterns as well developing  individualized performance goals for each student. Once a benchmark is established, we use that information to track student  progress as they receive targeted instruction. For example, from the F&P Reading Asessments we form guided reading groups  and from the DIBELS Next Assessments we form RTI groups. Progress monitoring checkpoints are included in between each of  the three formal assessment windows, on a weekly or biweekly basis.The TC Pathways Assessments described in question #1,  are analyzed on a frequent basis; always before, during and after a unit of study to inform flexible small group instruction.  In  specific, the writing progressions help teachers norm, analyze and reflect free writes and published pieces for special  populations (SWDs and ELLs) along with the general population. We use the data from the pre and post assessments to form  small groups for conferring cycles. The data also helps teachers to determine which self/peer assessment checklists  are appropriate for students to have as a reference in their tool kits. The visuals and "student friendly" language on the  checklists/rubrics help our ENL population obtain access to the rigorous classroom content.         3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The summative and benchmark assessments that we use to identify baseline, progress and areas of need are Performance  Tasks, Renaissance Star results (reading and math), Fountas and Pinnell reading assessments, DIBELS Next screening results,  MOSLs, and state wide assessments (ELA, Math, Science, NYSESLAT and Math/ES Regents). Teachers routinely take and  collect  summative data from small group instruction and conferences to support and guide future instruction. For example, at  the start and end of every reading and writing unit of study, teachers conduct a reading and writing pre/post assessment. We  use these performance tasks as a baseline to inform instruction and to track progress toward benchmark.  The TC Reading and  Writing Learning Progressions are used for this. In addition, to using state and summative data, our ENL Teachers will be able  to identify progress with our students using the appropiate performance indicators to advance our students across  performance levels. The performance indicators have been downloaded from ENGAGENY and are utilized daily with our ENL  Teachers. If our teachers are noticing that interventions are needed additional small group and 1:1 conferences will be  implemented to target deficits. We have multiple supports and resources in place to safeguard progress for all students.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once the summative data has been gathered, all of the teachers (classroom teachers, ENL teachers, intervention  teachers, IEP teacher, RTI team, and assistant principal) analyze the data. Our RTI team meets monthly to review this data and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65      identify inverventions needed and/or pathways to utilize for success. The focus is on addressing interventions that need to  take place (Tier 1, 2 or 3). Once the cycles of intervention group conferences are designed, progress monitoring benchmark  dates are set, usually on a weekly or biweekly basis.    For example, our DIBELS BOY screening revealed that students in grades K, 1 and 2 need additional support in: First Sound  Fluency, Letter Naming Fluency, Phoneme Segmentation Fluency, Phoneme Segmentation Fluency, and Oral Reading Fluency.  Therefore, we accessed specific lessons from the Now What? tools in the DIBELS instructional database to address the  necessary interventions. Tier 1, 2 and 3 supports were set up by the classroom teacher, the ENL teacher and our reading  specialist to ensure that the summative data results were addressed and monitored.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   We refer to a variety of data sources to guide our instruction for ELLs within the RTI framework. In literacy, we review the  students' reading level as assessed by the running records or concepts of print assessments. If the student is reading below  grade level, the classroom teacher provides Tier 1 RTI services. After a sequence of cycles of targeted instruction, overall  progress is assessed. Further interventions, if applicable, are then applied such as Tier 2 services. If the student is reading very  far below grade level, tier 2 RTI is implemented by our Leveled Literacy Intervention (LLI) teacher. Eligible ELLs participate in a  cycle of intense daily reading instruction, for about 10 - 12 weeks. We also constantly monitor progress, comparing growth to  that of formal data such as that of proficiency levels on the NYSESLAT and ELA NYS exam results. Similar steps are followed in  math and the content areas; Tier 1 RTI interventions are implemented by the classroom teacher with support from our ENL  teachers and related service providers.DIBELS Next and Renaissance Star Reading/Math serve as our universal screeners and  provide us with the necessary data to identify students who may be at risk for reading and math difficulties; helps teachers  identify areas to target instructional support; and helps to monitor at-risk students while they receive additional, targeted  instruction. The four action steps for schools within the RTI Framework include: universal screening, strong core instruction,  intensive tailored instruction, and progress monitoring. We follow these four steps to assure that our RTI framework for all  students, including ELLs, is in place.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Outcome assessments data that are used to evaluate and inform our ELL programs are a combination of performance-based  assessments (NYSESLAT, ELA, Math, Science, Regents) and progress-oriented assessments (Fountas and Pinnell Reading  Assessments, DIBELS Next BOY/MOY/EOY screenings, and various reading and writing pre/post assessments). Results from the  NYSESLAT assessment and the RLAT reports help guide our programming by identifying mandated minutes to be programmed  for our ENL students and staff. In addition, the reports show areas of strength and weakness across the 4 modalitites  (speaking, reading, writing and listening). Speaking and listening are areas of strengths in the intermediate grades. Whereas  writing and reading tend to be areas of need. Hence, the need for our ENL teachers to incorporate additional literacy  strategies that provide entry points to access the content in reader's and writer's workshop, such as those in the new TC  English Language Development Toolkit.The NYS CC ELA assessment results indicate that 12.8% of our ENL students are  performing at or above proficiency level. In addition, our CC Math assessment results indicate that 36% of our ENL students  are performing at or above profiency level. Also, our NYSESLAT results across grades K-8 indicate that our ENL students are  progressing across proficiency levels. Specifically, on average our ENL population performs 1 level higher than their previous  assessment (either NYSITELL for Kindergarten or new admit, and/or NYSESLAT for previous ELLs).    Furthermore, the Beginning of Year (BOY) DIBELS screening assesses the following skills/categories across grades K-2: First  Sound Fluency, Letter Naming Fluency, Phoneme Segmentation Fluency, Phoneme Segmentation Fluency, and Oral Reading  Fluency. ENL students that performed below benchmark (in the red category) in the 2017-2018 school year BOY screening  were: 8 in kindergarten, 12 in first grade, and 10 in 2nd grade. Each of these students are currently receiving intervention  services supported by the RtI team, with weekly progress monitoring sessions.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66         The ENL team meets on a consistent basis throughout the school year to discuss ENL-related matters. At the start of every  school year, the team meets and reviews the latest released assessment results from the Spring. The ENL teachers  immediately take the data and make adjustments to their program, if they are the sole provider of ENL services. As part of our  collaborative environment, our ENL co-teacher who offers the integrated services in the middle school then shares the reports  and findings with the content teacher during designated common planning periods. Furthermore, during common planning  periods and designated Mondays and Tuesdays professional curriculum revisions are made to reflect the findings in the  assessments.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   All of our ELLs in grades K-3 are grouped heterogeneously in a freestanding ENL class programmed by grade level. As  per CR Part 154.2, ELLs in our freestanding K-3 ENL classes are in mixed proficiency level classes taught by a dually  certified common branch/TESOL teacher.  An ELA instructional component incorporating the 4 modalities of  langugage and ENL standards as well as curriculum and a content area instructional component is focused on. All ELLs  in grades 4-8, are serviced through the ENL integrated model, also in heterogeneously grouped classes, via the  freestanding model and/or are taught by a content area/TESOL certified ENL teacher.     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?     All of our grade K-3 students receive the mandated number of instructional minutes according to proficiency levels via the  program they are in, Stand-Alone ENL and Integrated, with a dually certified teacher. Two of our middle school ENL teachers  are also certified in special education. These teachers are programmed to provide the mandated number of instructional  minutes in their schedules. Using the CR-154 guidelines in flexibility, based on performance levels, all of our MS SWD/ENL  students are programmed appropiately. Lastly, we have two ENL teachers who we program to service via the push-in model  for our 4th and 5th grade ENL students.      Due to the number and span of licensed TESOL teachers that we have, all entering level students receive both standalone and  integrated ENL. Emerging proficiency level students receive at minimum the 90 or 180 minutes of standalone ENL and 180 or  270 integrated minutes of ELA/ENL. Transitioning proficiency level students receive at minimum 90 mimimum of integrated  and standalone minutes, for a total of 180 minutes. Expanding level students receive the 180 minutes of instruction via  integrated services. Lastly, commanding level students receive the 90 mandated minutes via integrated ENL/ELA or content  area services.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   All instruction is provided in English, incorporating the four modalities: Listening, Speaking, Reading, and Writing. The goal of  our ENL program is to develop academic language and enhance student understanding of English while learning grade level  content.  Our focus is targeted at developing academic vocabulary and grammatical structures that often impede ELLs from  comprehending content area material. In all grades a Balanced Literacy program is implemented where ELLs are supported as  they read “just right” books, receive small group instruction based on need and confer on a regular basis with teachers.In  science and social studies our ELLs are supported in the content areas through the use of differentiated level texts to teach  content. Many of our ENL teachers as well as non-ENL students are bilingual therefore are able to communicate with our ENL  students in their native language on an as needed basis. Content area instruction focuses on providing students with a variety  of graphic organizers, analogies and previews to build meaningful verbal learning. In mathematics the focus is on building and  sharing problem solving strategies orally and in writing by having students work collaboratively and by using hands-on  materials to build concepts. These methods have been found to increase proficiency for our ELL students. In all content area  classrooms, teachers activate prior knowledge/build background knowledge; provide access to content; and extend language.  Materials such as photographs, charts and graphs are used to enable students, in Science and SS. Primary sources are also  referred to in SS. The content area teachers have been trained intensively in the CCLS. Since the ENL teachers are dually  certified teachers (common branch and TESOL), they have also been trained intensively in aligning lessons to the CCLS.  Teachers in grades K-3 are dually certified and deliver instruction in all content areas. The ENL Teachers provide instruction via  co-teaching and conferring. English is prodimantly the main language of instruction. However, our checklists and charts are  translated in the students native language.      4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   After analyzing the home language reports, we ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their native language during  both informal and formal assessments. During informal and formal reading assessments, students can respond in their native  language as a staff member interprets either verbally or in writing their response. Similarly, ELLs can write their responses to  classroom assignments, writers workshop pieces, etc. in their home language and a staff member also interprets either  verbally or in writing their response.  During formal assessments, we provide ELLs with translated exams (NYS Math  Exam, Math/Science Regents) and with native language/bilingual dictionaries, pictionaries.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a: We differentiate instruction for all ELL subgroups. The ENL teachers who work with our SIFE students use a variety of  manipulatives and visuals to enhance comprehension during the instruction time. For example, we use technology program  such as Raz-Kids, Storia, and Epic to provide reinforcement of language acquisition. In addition, we use strategies from Fountas  and Pinnell's Leveled Literacy Intervention (LLI) system to provide for SIFE students the foundational skills learned in the  primary grades that are necessary to catch up them with their grade-level peers and grade-level content.   b:  With ELLs who  are newcomers, basic conversational skills as well as concepts of print and literacy will be addressed.  PSMS 219 implements all  of the parts of the Balanced Literacy Curriculum. Additional supplemental materials include shared reading materials from  MONDO, the Let's Talk About It Kits as well as the Let's Sing About Kits to promote speaking and language immersion. We also  provide all ELLs with multiple opportunities such as the morning sunrise program and LLI. ENL teachers also use the Fountas  and Pinnell Phonics Lessons word study program to teach language skills. c:  Historically, data shows that our developing ELLS  are for the most part either advanced or proficient in listening/speaking and reading/writing.  Therefore, teachers will  continue to scaffold the language and use a variety of graphic organizers to assist the students with their accountable talk and  writing.  In addition, these students will receive support in the writing process as well as in the qualities of good writing, in  ways that lift the level of their writing across grade/common core aligned benchmarks. Materials include the MONDO graphic  organizers from the Now I Get It series as well as reading small groups created via the use of the Fountas and Pinnell Literacy   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68      Continuum. In content area classes, we use Tony Stead's nonfiction strategies.  d:  We currently have a few Long-term ELLs in  our middle school special education self-contained classrooms. When assessing data, the struggle lies in reading and  writing.  We will provide LTEs  with explicit verb and adjective usage in writing along with content/craft support. We will use  the MONDO Now I Get It series to supplement the balanced literacy components, including writer's workshop. In addition,  pre-writing activities that build background knowledge will also be implemented. Lastly, LTEs will be serviced by stand-alone  and integrated ENL services, since we have the appropriately licensed MS ENL staff. e. Former ELLs up to two years after  exiting ELL status will receive integrated ENL services in a content area classroom by one of our ENL Teachers. Strategies such  as modified guided reading, reciprocal teaching, and literature circles will be used to reinforce skills.       6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Teachers of ELL-SWDs use many instructional strategies and resources that provide access to academic content areas and  accelerate English language development.  For example, we utilize high-interest lower level reading materials designed to give  students access to content area information and implement methodologies designed to enable each student to meet his/her  IEP goals and objectives.  Short, leveled nonfiction texts from Newsela.com as well as from Scholastic subscriptions to  Storyworks and Scope magazines are also used to support content area knowledge. Digital literacy via the use of media clips on  the iPad and Smart Board are also incorporated as an access point for content. In addition, informational reading and writing  progressions are used from Teachers College to show students grade-level mentor examples, with the supporting leveled  resources.        7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Our school uses curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to meet the diverse needs of ELL-SWDs to achieve their  IEP goals and attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment in a variety of ways. For example, ELL-SWDs  participate in the same opportunities/programs and use the same materials as non ELL-SWD students. Also, teachers of ELL- SWDs attend/participate in professional development sessions that provide them with the appropriate resources to best teach  their students. For example, a number of our TC labsites and meetings center around teaching strategies for ELL-SWDs. Lastly,  our related service providers work in conjunction with the teachers who support ELL-SWDs to share best practices.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.    The intervention for ELLs in ELA, Math and other content areas are a mix of both the push-in/pull-out model. Entering and  emergent primary grade ENL students receive a brief cycle of intervention with our LLI reading specialist, in addition to the ENL  support from their ENL classroom teacher. She provides students with daily, targeted foundational literacy instruction in a  small setting, max 4 students. Upper grade and middle school entering and emergent level ENL students participate in pull-out  services in addition to their push-in services to provide an extra layer of vocabulary introduction, background knowledge, and  planning tools that will transfer to the content area subject.  Teachers conduct the following strategies during Science and SS, to activate prior knowledge and build background knowledge:  brainstorming/discussion, use of graphic organizers, visuals in texts, short-term and long-term direct experiences. To access  content, they dramatize and clarify language as well as relate academic words to student's native language. During math,  teachers use visuals and provide hands on experiences as well as make personal and cultural connections.As previously  described, primary grade ENL students are screened with DIBELS Next. The screening tool is also a progress monitoring  tool which provides targeted intervention lessons in ELA for the ENL teachers to use to increase proficiency. The resources are  from the Now What Tools. The same process takes place with ENL students in grades 3-8 via Renaissance Star.   Intervention  programs also occur before school during the ENL Sunrise program (three times a week for four months in the winter/spring  months), during the school day via conferences, as well as during RTI Tier 1 and 2 services multiple times a week. Intervention  programs also occur before school during the ENL Sunrise program (three times a week for four months in the winter/spring  months), during the school day via conferences, as well as during RTI Tier 1 and 2 services multiple times a week.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?        Based on the success of our RTI services and ENL students' success in them, we will be adding a new resource for ENL teachers  to use in the upcoming school year. New to our RTI plan is the implementation of the kit "Scaffolding the Comprehension  Toolkit for English Language Learners." The intensive mini-lessons and strategies in this program support ENL language  development in content classes. Such lessons help students build background knowledge and introduces concepts, vocabulary,  and language structures. In addition, students are provided with high quality explicit practice with grammar, syntax  and accuracy, as well as content and comprehension extensions.    Furthermore, we will incoporate the English Language Development Toolkit developed by Teachers College alongside ENL  experts across grades K-8 as support when planning and adapting our ELA curriculum. Each of the toolkits are written  specifically for a particular grade and identify specific techniques to incoporate in all of the units of study taught throughtout  the entire year to provide ENL students with entry points and access to rigorous grade level content.        10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs and events.  They are a part of all instructional periods and school  events, since we limit the periods of pull-out services.  Supplemental services offered to ELLs are the Sunrise Test Prep  Academy (for ESL, ELA and Math), and Leveled Literacy Intervention RTI services (LLI). In addition, middle school ELLs take part  in and fully participate in Regents level courses (Algebra and Earth Science). School events such as monthly PA funded Family  nights, student of the month, middle school overnight trips are also offered to ELLs.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Some instructional materials used to support ELLs include: All of the resources provided by Columbia University Teacher’s  College to support the reading and writing workshop models (such as leveled progressions, leveled rubrics, leveled mentor  texts); iPad technology as well as listening centers along with interactive Internet sites and the Smart Board; Accelerated Math,  Newsela.com as well as Raz Kids/Storia/Brainpop online. The ELMO is also used in all ENL classrooms as a technology tool to  model literacy strategies.Our school has recently purchased Promethean boards to replace low technology white boards. The  Promethean boards help our ENL Teachers make interactive lessons by integrating websites, music and visuals into their daily  lessons. In addition, these newly purchased boards makes access to translation websites instantaneous for our ENL students.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   We meet as a team monthly to discuss patterns and growth to assure that our students' second language development is  considered in instructional decisions. We purchase resources based on the need displayed by language proficiency levels. For  example, if a child is in 5th grade and is an "entering level" as well is reading below grade level standard, we purchase high- interest low level chapter books or bilingual books in the child's native language as well as English. Students also have access to  native language/bilingual dictionaries. We also plan for which instructional methods best fit depending on which modality is of  focus- reading, writing, listening or speaking. In addition, we scaffold when accessing grade level texts, especially in the  nonfiction genre. Classroom teachers use data to form flexible groups based on proficiency levels. Some of our ENL teachers  are fluent in Chinese, Greek and Spanish. We also pair ELLs up with other students who are bilingual in their native language as  well as English therefore translate instruction on the spot as needed.   As addressed above in Part IV, question #4: "After analyzing the home language reports, we ensure that ELLs are appropriately  evaluated in their native language during both informal and formal assessments. During informal and formal reading  assessments, students can respond in their native language as a staff member interprets either verbally or in writing their  response. Similarly, ELLs can write their responses to classroom assignments, writer's workshop pieces, etc. in their home  language. A staff member who speaks the home language then interprets either verbally or in writing their response.  During  formal assessments, we provide ELLs with translated exams (NYS Math Exam, Math/Science Regents) and with native  language/bilingual dictionaries, pictionaries."     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70         14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    The ENL teachers provide age appropriate materials depending on the students' grade level and abilities. For example, middle  school ELLs receive push in services so that they do not miss subject classroom instruction in combination with conferences  that provide an extra layer of scaffold so that the middle school ENL student does not feel "behind." In the primary grades, we  engage in many shared class experiences such as shared reading, singing of songs and poems, picture sorting for vocabulary  development and story telling to foster immersion of language. Also, as stated above in this section in question #9, this school  year we will incoporate the English Language Development Toolkit developed by Teachers College alongside ENL experts  across grades K-8 as support when planning and adapting our ELA curriculum. Since each of the toolkits are written by grade,  this ensures that all required resources support and correspond to ELLs grade level benchmarks. These reading and writing  resources complement the TC reading and writing CCLS aligned units of study and provide ENL students with entry points and  access to rigorous grade level content.        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    N/A     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Families who bring their children to register meet the ENL Teacher and are provided assistance through translation as needed.  Newly enrolled ELL students also go on a tour of the school and see first-hand all of the experiences they will receive. Parents  receive information packets as well as a June orientation on ELL activities. ELLs who enroll throughout the school year are  given a peer buddy to help adjust to the new setting as well as the above described orientation activities. The parent  coordinator, assistant principal and lead ENL teachers (Ms. Tang and Ms. Gigante) are involved in these activities.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    We offer Mandarin as a language elective for all middle school ELLs.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?    All ELL personnel at PSMS 219 (teachers of ELLs, paraprofessionals, administrators, guidance counselors, related service  providers,  parent coordinator, and office staff) will receive in-house PD as well as off-site PD opportunities. Structured  professional development sessions and workshops will be provided by the DELLSS, our licensed ENL teachers, administrators,  Teachers College staff developers, the Queens North Borough Field Support Center, and consultants.  Topics include, but are  not limited to academic language of science and math teachers of ELLs, developing academic language for algebra teachers of  ELLs, and NYSESLAT PD. Topics of discussion will include differentiation as well as instructional methods that support ELLs  across each of the stages of language development. Classroom teachers and paraprofessionals will also be provided with  structured PD/workshops designed to develop strategies to modify instruction in the content areas and to develop vocabulary   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71         and improve comprehension. Professional texts related to ELLs will also be used in staff development sessions, study groups  and inquiry teams. A log of professional development is maintained by the ENL supervisor, which includes the table of  organization, and a sampling of agendas from workshops with dates and topics.Specific titles of full day workshops at Teachers  College for ELLs and Literacy are: Develop a Toolkit of Methods to Support English Language Learners in Becoming Stronger  Readers and Writers/Ramping Up Shared Reading, Shared Writing, and Interactive Writing to Support Grammar and Writing  Conventions for English Language Learners/Upper Grade Readers Need Phonics Support, Too! Essential Support Identifying  Students’ Phonics Needs and Planning and Teaching Responsively to Address These.  Also, in-house cycles of TC staff  development for grades K-2, 3-5 and 6-8 will provide lab sites to specifically support ELL teachers.      As workshops arise from DELLSS and our Field Support Centers, we will attend. Some examples of workshops we have  attended or have registered for so far include: Strengthening the Tier I Math Instruction within an RTI Model for ELLs (3- 5)/Fortifying Academic Conversations in the ENL Classrooms (Grades 6 to 12). We also have a designated liaison that has  attended the "Nuts and Bolts" session as well as a district liaison series to learn and maintain best compliance practices. A  middle school DELLSS Writing Series in November will provide scaffolding techniques as well as strategies to use in content  classrooms. In addition, we will have an ENL Teacher attending a DELLSS workshop specifically providing guidance on ENL data  reports. Lastly, we are also participating in three district professional learning sessions with Maryann Cucchiara.       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Our school meets the PD requirements since at minimum 15% of the total hours of PD provided throughout the entire school  year for all teachers of ELLs specifically addresses the needs of English language learners. As prescribed by CR Part 154.2, once  a month during the Monday PD time or Tuesday Collaboration time, ENL teachers meet in study groups to focus on best  practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for English language learnersOur ENL  Teachers have many opportunities to attend professional development cycles through DELLSS and Teachers College. These  workshops often provide best practices for intergrating language and strategies to utilize in ENL classrooms. In addition, when  a staff member attends a PD outside of the school building, she is responsible for turn keying the information to the rest of the  staff. This will in turn, provide the mandated hours for staff that could not leave the building. Each teacher maintains his/her  own individual PD Log to track professional development and professional opportunities.             Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   We schedule annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs on the Tuesday parent engagement times, throughout the school  year. Since these are appointments that are scheduled ahead of time, interpretation is arranged as needed. In addition, goals  and progress of SWDs who are also ELLs are discussed during annual IEP meetings. Lastly, two full days are designated in  February for parent meetings. Our ENL Teachers meet with parents to discuss progress using the Performance Level  Descriptions published on EngageNY. These meetings also provide an opportunity for parents to see their child's progress  across units of study. Families are given a portfolio of student work (pre and post assessments, reading assessments, etc.) and  exemplar grade work to support growth in literacy across content areas. Records of attendance will be electronically stored in  our OneDrive as well maintaining a hard copy in our ENL binder.       2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  Parents are invited to attend meetings about ELL options, workshops to develop English Language skills, Family Night activities,  Meet the Teacher Night in September, Parent/Teacher conferences in November, March and May, Monthly Parent Association  meetings, individual meetings concerning their child’s progress, trips, celebrations, and special events.  All events are posted   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72         on our school website http://psms219.org, are written in multiple languages on letters sent home, and are recorded in  translated languages via home voice messages.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Frederick Wright, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      At PSM/MS 219, the staff uses a variety of data sources to assess language preferences of our community: ATS  Adult Preferred Language Report (RAPL), Home Language Identification Survey, the RLER report, and Student  Emergency Contact Cards (specific section on preferred language). We also evaluate the needs of parents through  conversations, meetings, phone calls, surveys, and the DOE's Parents' Preferred Language Form. All staff and the  parent coordinator assist in this.           2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      Besides English, the two most dominant languages (Chinese and Spanish) are spoken amongst multiple staff members  in the building. In an event of an emergency, these designated staff members will call a child’s parent/guardian. If a   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          79      translator is needed for any other language besides the three dominant languages, we will use the NYCDOE  translation pipeline, at (855) 249-9103, when communicating with the guardian. Our school uses a voice messenger  which can send automated translated phone calls to all family members            Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      During the first two Professional Development days in September, the staff will be informed of translation  procedures. Specifically, staff will be reminded that minor students shall not translate. In addition, the staff will be  reminded of the 6 languages in which vital documents are already translated. To meet compliance needs, the NYCDOE  Translation number will be acknowledged and distributed to any staff member that will require it (in case no other in- house staff member can translate). As a reminder, the following handout from the NYCDOE will also be placed in the  teacher’s mailboxes. http://www.nyc.gov/html/ops/downloads/pdf/lap/lap_doe.pdf          Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      We meet the entire Chancellor's Regulations for A-663 by providing timely translations for parents to enable them to  have access to the same information as English speaking parents by utilizing staff, DOE publications, DOE translation  services, Title III funds to pay for outside contractors, and simultaneous transmitters for our meetings such as PA and  Town Hall meetings. In addition, we post documents such as the Parents Bill of Rights on our school website  www.PSMS219.org for all parents to access. Translation signs and notices are posted in the lobby, by the main  entrance, in the main office and in the parent coordinator's office. All notification documents can be found at the  Translation and Interpretation Unit’s intranet site:  http://intranet.nycboe.net/SchoolSupport/translation_and_interpretation_unit.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       We evaluate the needs of parents through conversations, meetings, phone calls, surveys, and the DOE's Parents'  Preferred Language Form. All staff and our parent coordinator assist in this. For the first time, this school year we will  designate a Monday Professional Development series where translations and interpretations procedures will be  addressed. Guidelines and protocols will be established before oral and /or written translations are to be made. A  flow chart of accessible translators will be distributed within the building to ensure the awareness of staff and in turn  will improve our school’s language services.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          80
