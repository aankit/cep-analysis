This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   School Mission Statement (2018) PS/IS 171 will organize the classroom as a learner-centered environment so all  students will succeed.    School Vision Statement (2018) PS/IS 171 will provide all students with access to becoming independent learners.   We will instill our Core Values of Community, Dedication and Open-Mindedness with our students.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9            2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    PS/IS 171 is housed in a gothic five story building in East Harlem on 103 Street between Madison and Fifth Avenue.  Our Pre-Kindergarten through grade eight classes have approximately 776 students representing an ethnically diverse  population comprised of 57% Hispanic, 26% African American, 4% Caucasian, 1% American Indian and 7% Asian  students.       PS/IS 171 strives for high levels of academic achievement and a focused data-driven instructional program Over the  past ten years, the school met state standards for both English Language Arts (ELA) and Mathematics according to the  performance index. The school also met or exceeded Annual Yearly Progress (AYP) targets for both ELA and  Mathematics as well. Results of the 2017 New York State ELA tests indicate that 72% of students overall in grades 3-8  achieved Level 3 proficiency or higher with 71% of students overall achieving Level 3 or 4 in Mathematics. In the area  of Science, 100% of fourth grade students achieved level 3 or higher and 89% of eighth grade students achieving level  3 or 4 proficiency level on the 2017 Science test. In the area of advanced courses, 71.6% of eighth grade students  enrolled received high school credit after passing the New York State Regents exams in Living Environment and CC  Algebra I in June 2017.       Our academic program is articulated through the grades and aligned to New York State Learning Standards. This  enables the teachers to build strong foundational skills and a comprehensive knowledge base with critical and higher  level thinking skills using Depth of Knowledge (DOK) and Conceptual Understanding for mathematics and science. One  hundred percent of our students are taught by highly qualified teachers who participate in inter-visitations, weekly  teacher team meetings, data conferences with the Principal, professional learning cycles aligned to school goals and  district programs. Student attendance and ‘on time’ performance is closely monitored through a school-wide  program. We strongly believe that students learn best when they are actively engaged within the activities of a  rigorous and challenging curriculum.       Our school has established strong partnerships with more than two dozen cultural and educational organizations  including: Harlem Center (grades 6-8), DREAM (grades K-5), Mount Sinai Hospital School of Medicine, Academy of  Medicine, DREAM-SHI Program, Carmel Hill Fund/Accelerated Reader, New York Horticultural Society, New York  Cares, BEAM 6 & BEAM 7 Summer Enrichment, Child Mind Institute, Urban Advantage Science Program, Chess in the  Schools, Hunter College, Studio in a School, and Verizon Innovative Learning Initiative.   Results of the most recent Learning Environment Surveys indicate that parents strongly believe that our school has  high expectations and encourages children to have stamina and persistence with challenging work. Parents strongly  agreed that their children are on track for college, career and success in life and that the school implements rigorous  and meaningful academic goals for their students. Parents were in strong agreement that they are kept informed  about their child’s progress and were satisfied with services including tutoring, after school programs or workshops.  Parents felt that the school creates a physically and emotionally secure environment in which each child can focus on  learning. Students in grades 6-8 strongly agreed that the school encouraged them to do their best by developing  rigorous and meaningful academic goals. Students in sixth, seventh and eighth grade agreed that teachers expected  all students to work hard and that teachers encouraged them to keep trying when completing challenging work.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      Students also felt strongly that their teachers expected them to continue their education after high school and kept  them on track to be promoted and for college and careers. Students agreed with parents that the school created a  physical and emotionally secure environment in which they could focus on learning. Students also agreed that there  was an adult they could go to for help with a problem.   PS/IS 171 is a collaborative, caring community composed of dedicated faculty, earnest and intellectually curious  students and supportive and concerned parents. Through celebrations and traditions, professional development,  partnerships and grants, we support and strengthen our school culture and sense of pride in our school community.

Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Students with Disabilities account for approximately 20% of students with a slightly higher percentage in grades six,  seven and eight. Special education services are provided through SETSS teachers in grade Kindergarten through fourth  grade and through ICT teachers in grades five through eight. In addition, students receive speech and language,  counseling, occupational therapy and physical therapy services as designated in their individual IEP's. The special  education providers work collaboratively with classroom teachers to ensure that they strategically support their  students to succeed in the classroom. In addition to school-wide best practices including Close Reading strategies to  improve comprehension and Depth of Knowledge (DOK) to enhance critical thinking, special education teachers use  specific programs such as the Wilson Reading Program to build phonemic analysis and decoding skills.   There are approximately 4% of students receiving ENL Services through a dedicated ENL teacher who supports  students in Kindergarten through Eighth Grade through a combination of 'push-in' and 'small group' reinforcement.  The ENL teachers meets with grade level teams and individual teachers weekly to collaborate on strategies to ensure  students can readily access the curriculum.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   According to the 'Framework for Great Schools Report' 2018, our school exceeded citywide averages in Rigorous  Instruction, scoring 93% for Common Core Shifts in Literacy, 100% for Common Core Shifts in Math, 90% Course  Clarity and 84% for Academic Press with a score of 4.71 for the entire category.

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     After completing a comprehensive review of ELA results from the New York State Spring testing in 2016, 2017 and  2018, as well as, results from running records (K-5), performance based assessments (K-8), Rally Interim Assessments  (Grades 2-8), Achieve3000 (Grades 2-8) and other formative assessments, it was determined that grade level teams  need to further revise and align curriculum maps and curriculum based assessments to promote all students as critical  thinkers that would result in more rigorous curriculum and instruction leading to higher levels of cognitive  engagement for all students. Although results from the 2018 Framework for Great Schools indicate consistency with  high scores exceeding the City-wide average in the category of Rigorous Instruction, with 93% score in Common Core  Shifts in Literacy, 100% score in Common Core Shifts in Math, 93% score in Course Clarity, and 84% in Academic Press,  we believe that further analysis and revision to content curriculum maps and curriculum-based assessments will result  in higher levels of cognitive engagement and achievement Of particular focus will be to enhance the quality of  student-led discussion and building student-independence in learning as delineated in our 2018-2019 School Goals  Phase VIII: "Promoting Student Independence".

They have the opportunity to participate in professional  development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement.      Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   A major focus over the past four years is to enhance the collaborative effectiveness of teacher teams resulting in  refinement of pedagogical practices, standards aligned curriculum and systematic monitoring of student progress  using various data sources to ensure continuous monitoring of student learning. According to the 2017-18 School  Quality Guide, we received an overall 90% of cultural awareness and inclusive classroom instruction where 98% of  students say their teachers respect their culture or background. We also received a 92% overall for innovation and  collective responsibility where 100% of teachers say that the teachers feel responsible that all students 100% of  teachers say they design instructional programs and 100% of teachers say they talk to one another about instruction.  The findings of our most recent Quality Review 2016 (Indicator 3.4), 'School leaders and staff consistently and  effectively communicate high expectations for teaching and learning across the school. The school's culture for  learning systematically communicates a unified set of high expectations that prepares students for success at high  school and beyond". The report continues, "Effective communication of high expectations results in a culture of  mutual accountability and supports students in owning their educational experiences". Under Indicator 4.2, 'Effective  collaboration structures allow teachers to reflect on their practice and make decisions determining improvements  across the school, building teacher instructional capacity and increasing student outcomes". The consistent  applications of school-wide systems and protocols articulated across and between grade levels has resulted in higher  levels of performance in both English Language Arts and Mathematics on New York State testing.    In this regard, teacher teams have been restructured to ensure that teachers’ professional responsibilities align with  the school’s instructional goals, focusing teacher time on instructional work and resulting in improved instruction that  engages all students in challenging academic tasks. For the 2018- 2019 school year, teacher teams will participate in  regularly scheduled collaborative inquiry work using coherent protocols, engage in data-driven discussions, and  develop instructional supports to build the capacity of teachers and impact student achievement. Through the use of  refined protocols, classroom and expanded school inter-visitations, intra- and inter-grade level and department  meetings, first and second year teacher mentoring, and weekly new teacher meetings, teachers will collaborate to  explore evidence and refine approaches to best reflect high expectations. Communication between the instructional  cabinet and teacher teams will inform themes of study in weekly professional development sessions and professional  work time.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers.

The collaborative nature of our teacher teams connects school-wide professional development sessions to smaller and  more frequent teamwork. The analysis of data within each teacher team focuses on the timely monitoring of student  progress and ensures that targeted instruction will be provided to maintain continuous student growth with skills.  Through the Student Work Protocol, teacher teams analyze specific lessons/tasks and focus on instructional next steps  to address student needs. Through the Interim Assessments Previewing Protocol, teachers preview assessments  engaging in close reading making observations regarding the language and questioning. Based upon classroom noticings,  patterns and trends, teachers analyze which components of the assessment students will find challenging or unfamiliar.  Teachers gain a deeper understanding of the methodology behind testing language, content and techniques that impact  student achievement. Teachers refine curriculum in order to infuse appropriate academic language and questioning to  support student learning. Teachers then use data analysis from their team meetings to identify the top three skill needs  exhibited by their class and plan three re-teaching lessons. Following Re-Teaching Week, teachers collectively discuss  effective strategies and brainstorm strategies for areas that did not show growth. Teachers reflect upon the discussion  and utilize resulting ideas to revise curriculum maps, ensuring inclusion of additional lessons, instructional supports. This  will directly impact the improvement of the teaching process. By June 2018, school-wide structures and supportive  systems will result in maintaining 95% or higher school attendance rate with 95% promotion rate in grades K-7 and  100% graduation rate in eighth grade according to Department of Education data sources.          2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          25     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

Students in our Pre- Kindergarten program participate in regular science, music, movement and art programs similar to elementary  students. They have access to technology resources both within their own classrooms (computers, iPads), as well as,  the elementary computer lab. Pre-K teachers participate in all school-wide professional development and follow  grade level meeting protocol and procedures. Teachers meet monthly with administrators to discuss student progress  and maintain portfolio data for each student. Parents of Pre-K students are encouraged to participate in monthly PTA  meetings and attend parent-teacher conferences. Students who are identified as in need receive special education  services and/or ESL intervention.        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41      Teachers meet in grade level teams and cross functional teams to review student data gathered from administration  of Fountas-Pinnell Running Records (Grades K-5), Rally Interim Assessments (grades 2-8), Accelerated Reader (grades  K-8), Achieve3000 (grades 2-8) and city and state assessments. In addition, grade level teams review student data  from performance-based assessments for each unit of study, portfolio collection, unit tests and teacher conferring  notes.    Teachers in grades K-4 administer Fountas-Pinnell Running Records and expect each student to increase a minimum  of two reading levels by January, 2018 and an increase of a third reading level by June 2019.    Grade level teams work collaboratively to develop common performance-based assessments for each unit of study.  Interdisciplinary teams in grades 7-8 meet weekly to review and align units of study and assessments.    Teachers participate in inter-visitations with regard to implementation of best practices.    Teachers are encouraged to participate as members of the Professional Development Committee.    Teachers have option to select formal/informal observation format with teacher evaluation process.    Teachers are encouraged to attend district and other Department of Education school year and summer workshops to  enhance their learning.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS/IS 171 , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the  Elementary and Secondary Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to  strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s  policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of  the education of their children.      PS/IS 171 will support parents and families of all of our student as we are a School-wide Title I school by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children; especially with an emphasis on independent  reading/conceptualized learning   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, district and citywide meetings and other activities in  a format, and in languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   * provide parents with a yearly updated Parent Handbook containing school contact information, behavioral student  expectations, school uniform policy, daily schedules for each grade level, resource information, after school programs  and helpful websites         Parental Involvement and School Quality   Our school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent  Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.      In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parent members of the school’s Parent Association , as well as  parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy  and asked to survey their members for additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school  quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent- Teacher Association and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support and ongoing professional  development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator to serve as a liaison between the school and families. The Parent Coordinator will  work collaboratively with the Literacy Coach to provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the parents  of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and inviting to all  parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents each month and  file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops monthly with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational  accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support  services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home and in school. For the 2018-  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      2018 school year, the following early morning workshops will be offered for parents to promote equity&access, hone  in on socio-emotional development and sustain academic excellence/achievement through our workshop/community  reads focused on the following:   -high expectations and standards to answer "What mark will you make on your school year?"   -raising awareness for community and civic engagement through a culminating service project   -teamwork, collaboration, friendship, building relationships and promoting equity   -fostering cultural awareness and cultural sensitivity school wide; inside and outside the classroom- parents and  students will engage in a culminating project of working collaboratively to create a quilt to reflect cultural upbringings   -Charity work/Fund raising to help those in need- 'Shoes that fit fundraiser' to help the impoverished and making a  difference to allow children of all ages to attend schools with dignity, prepared to learn and thrive   ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g.,ESSA/State accountability  system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning  Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents  about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in the program and the parent involvement  requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act  (ESSA)   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;       The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   ● holding a Fall and Spring Parent Curriculum Evening;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams and Parent Association    ● supporting or hosting Family Day events such as the Verizon Innovative Learning Initiative programs   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress and provide online progress information through Pupil Path/Skedula for daily parent  communication of student progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress including our school www.ps171.org;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      ● provide written and technology-based ongoing communication between teacher and the home in a format, and to  the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand using Class Dojo, Remind101 and others;   * provide parents with an updated Parent Handbook containing important school contact information, behavioral  expectations for students, school uniform policy, daily schedules for each grade level, resource information, after  school programs and helpful parent websites.   * keep parents fully informed of District 4 Workshops and community programs (i.e. Parent Engagement Tuesday's)  and promote parent attendance throughout the year to attend:   - Special Education Series Workshops    - School Leadership Team Workshops   - Title I Information                 School-Parent Compact (SPC)   PS/IS 171 , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is  implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between  the school and the families.

What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   P.S. 171 has a number of structures that support the collection and analysis of fomative assessment that informs instructional  planning and delivery for ELLs/MLLs. The teachers follow a school-wide assessment calendar, participate in monthly data  conferences with administration, collaborate in weekly teacher team meetings for data and student work analysis and develop  data-informed curriculum, plan for guided small groups and RTI protocols, and take part in professional learning aligned to  goals and student needs. These formative assessment structures support the analysis of reading lexile progression and  student performance within standard-based reading comprehension writing tasks to inform instructional planning for ELLs.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The summative assessment and baseline/benchmark assessments that our school utilizes to identify baseline, progress and  areas of need for English Language Learners include:    1. NYSESLAT  2. End-of-Year NYC Performance Assessments in ELA and Math  3. End-of-Year Fountas and Pinnell Reading Running Records (MOSL)  4. End-of-Year Rally Interim Assessment  5. End-of-Year District 4 Writing Assessment  6. Achieve 3000 Lexile Level-Set  7. STAR Reading     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    P.S. 171 has well-established structures in place to address interventions once summative data has been gathered. The  teachers follow a school-wide assessment calendar, participate in monthly data conferences with administration, collaborate  in weekly teacher team meetings for data and student work analysis and develop data-informed curriculum, plan for guided  small groups and RTI protocols, and take part in professional learning aligned to goals and student needs. Patrick Henry School  provides extensive support for all students attending our school. The goal is to provide the necessary support within the least  restrictive environment that will ensure that our students are successful in their school experience – academic, social and  emotional. Students eligible for ENL services are monitored closely by the ENL teacher in coordination with other support  specialists including special education, academic intervention, speech and language, literacy coach, guidance counselors and  administration. Constant item analysis of both informal and formal assessments assist the ENL teacher's instruction as well as  the student's progress of acquiring the English language across all content areas. Student checklists, student exit slips, student  to teacher journals, rubrics, feedback and reflection forms all assist in the monitoring of student development.  AMA01 and  AMAO2 data, School Progress Reports, STAR Reading, Accelerated Reader, Achieve3000, L2RPT results also assist in the study  of student assessment and progress/success. These structures ensure that proactive scheduling, data-analysis, and reflective  instructional considerations are aligned with summative assessment data.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Our school uses data to guide instruction for ELLs/MLLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework by first  ensuring that all teachers provide students with a strong TIER 1 instruction by following the Danielson Framework, utilizing  research-based instructional practices and support from coaches, and ensuring collaboration among cooperating teachers.  Technology such as iPads, Macbooks and computer labs serve as tools to strengthen core instruction and collect formative  assessment data. Teachers use data to properly plan and execute lessons aligned to the common core by providing many  forms of comprehensible input, planning and preparation, strategies, building background, positive interaction, strategic  grouping, constant practice, and frequent assessment.  Upon maximizing all strategies within the classroom, the ENL teacher  as part of the School Based Support Team works collaboratively with classroom teachers and parents to assist TIER 2 and TIER  3 students by a push-in or pull-out system to provide extra attention, activities and experiences designed to address the needs  of the individual students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The data from outcome assessments such as the NYSESLAT and New York State End-of-Year ELA and Math Performance  Assessments are used to evaluate and inform decisions regarding the efficacy of the ELL program at our school. Proficiency  levels along with language modality scores from the RLAT report in ATS inform teachers of student strengths and areas for  focused intervention. The ELL Data Analysis Tool, which is updated monthly to reflect the most current information from  the RELC, RLER and RESI reports from ATS, is utilized to establish data patterns by grade level, English proficiency and home  language. Moreover, the EDAT is evaluated to determine scheduling of the ENL teacher in the content area where  ELLs/MLLs need the most academic and language support.           7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   P.S. 171 utilizes various in-person and technology-based structures to disseminate outcome assessment findings to teachers  and administrators. The teachers participate in monthly data conferences with administration, collaborate in weekly teacher  team meetings for data and student work analysis and data-informed curriculum development, plan for guided small groups  and RTI protocols, and take part in professional learning aligned to goals and student needs. Additionally, teachers and  administrators analyze, collaborate and reflect on teacher and school data findings on the school's online Google Drive.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Instruction is delivered in multiple forms such as the stand alone model and integrated model as outlined in CR Part  154. Within the Integrated ENL model, methodologies such as sheltered instruction are provided during content area  instruction co-taught or individually taught by a certified teacher. Within the Stand-Alone ENL model, the certified  ENL teacher to develops thematic units that support the academic English language skills that students need to  engage independently in grade-level, content-area classes. Heterogeneous grouping of students is established  through data results (for proficiency levels) such as from student’s most recent NYSESLAT/NYISTELL results along with  grade levels. The ENL teacher works closely with the classroom teacher while incorporating small group  instruction/tiers with a collaborative teaching model to reinforce and develop specific skills related to language  acquisition, decoding, reading comprehension, mathematical concepts and more. The ENL teacher also maintains  ongoing communication with classroom teachers and other support specialists regarding each student action plan  using a conference template form to keep track of student progress while identifying next steps. Ongoing training  with refining teacher skills with differentiated instruction continues to be a major focus for professional  development.     b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     The school does not currently have a TBE program.   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      The school does not currently have a TBE program.      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      As per the CR Part 154 the mandated units of instructional minutes for ELLs/MLLs according to proficiency levels are  maintained and ensured through documentation in STARS classroom online.  Additionally, the ENL teacher documents each  integrated and stand alone session/class using a class tracking document for all ELLs in grades K-8.  The program model  consists of the ENL teacher working with identified students during the English Language Arts (ELA)/Mathematics block of  approximately ninety minutes several times a week in the regular classroom setting within an integrated model, as well as,  providing stand alone instruction tailored to specific student content and language objectives for forty-five minutes several  times a week. Entering and Emerging level students receive 2 units of study per week totalling 360 minutes both the stand  alone and integrated model throughout the week on different days. Our expanding students receive 1 ENL and 1 unit of study  per week totalling 180 minutes through a both integrated and stand alone model as well. Our former ELL population also  receive transitional support through the integrated model by the ENL teacher during content area classes.                3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Content areas are delivered in each program in English with native language support ( i.e. texts, dictionaries, Internet  resources). Instructional Approaches and methods used to make content and language instruction comprehensible for our ELL  students reflect New York State ENL Learning Standards and Grade Level Performance Indicators. For example, for Standard 1,  Performance Indicator 2: Students will listen, speak, read and write in English for information and understanding. Students at  the PreK-1 level are providing with opportunities to listen, read, gather and discuss information from story and picture books  and audio materials.. At the elementary level, grades 2-4, students are provided with opportunities to read, gather, view, listen  to, organize, discuss and interpret information related to academic content areas including use of the Internet, audio and  media presentations. While at the middle levels, grades 5-8, ENL students use resources including non-fiction books, reference  books, magazines, textbooks, as well as, the Internet, databases, audio and media presentations, oral interviews, charts,  graphs and diagrams to develop their skills.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   To ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their native language, our school orders the New York State Math, Science  and Social Studies assessments in all appropriate languages including Spanish, Russian, Haitian Creole, Chinese and French. All  acuity and periodic assessments are also ordered and administered if necessary in the appropriate languages for our second  language learners.  Materials are always readily available for the testing of our ELL students. Also, students whose native  language is Spanish also partake in our foreign language program as part of their curriculum. Students are assessed at the end  of the year with the Spanish proficiency exam and Spanish Regents if applicable. In the classroom, students are presented with  an opportunity to discuss a question or assignment in their home language before sharing a response with the whole class in  English.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.  a. SIFE  The ENL teacher collaborates with the content teachers, parents, community to embrace the cultural difference of the SIFE  students to create a warm environment for the students to thrive in.  The teacher emphasizes on the socioeconomic needs of  the students to increase confidence in order to build a nurturing relationship.  Small groupings and counseling services are put  in place to offer personal attention and support to each SIFE student through both the integrated and stand alone  model.  P.S.171 has a plethora of extracurricular programs after school that revolve around the areas of music, arts and sports  allow students to get involved and flourish.  Our extended day program also focuses on those small groups of SIFE students to  further support students academically in either English Language Arts or Math.  The use of technology is also a main tool used  to facilitate the learning for our SIFE students. The program Achieve3000 is tailored to students who need all the scaffolding   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      and differentiation possible.  This program is also offered in Spanish, where students can listen, read and complete different  activities based on their lexile level in Spanish.  Most importantly, Sheltered instruction is increased and modified so that  subject matter is more comprehensible to students with limited vocabularies. The increased use of visuals, collaborative  learning activities, and demonstrations/modeling at all times is also present. Emphasizing school routines by reviewing all  symbols including safety symbols that are posted in the room and around the building are key components of practicing  everyday school life. Also remedial intervention services are implemented to provide basic English skills needed such as  phonics, phonemic awareness, vocabulary for survival, and comprehension.         b. Newcomer  0-3 year ELLs (including newcomers): The ENL teacher provides mainly a push-in model while implementing stand alone  instruction to improve speaking skills. The teacher utilizes the integrated model during content areas of science, social studies  and ELA. Collaborative co-teaching occurs between content area teachers and the ESL teacher to ensure strategies of  comprehensible input are being used; this includes students being able to understand the essence of what is being said or  presented to them, so that they can orally explain what they have just acquired.  Teachers provide frequent opportunities for  students to respond orally and to speak their ideas aloud.  Strategies such as cooperative learning help students work with  their peers to discuss the material constructively by giving and receiving feedback to one another.  During group discussions,  teachers can have students use partner share talk to “retell” or “report back” the story to the group.  Teachers also ask types  of analytical, descriptive, interpretive questions consistently throughout lessons to encourage students to express both facts  and opinions orally.  Students will receive at least 5 periods of ELA during the week.  The ESL teacher also pulls out a minimum  of three periods to work on strategies in a writing workshop. Strategies that will be implemented by the ENL teacher, ELA  teacher and other content area teachers are to have students keep a writing dialog.  For example, students will be able to  write about non-fiction topics while building a bridge into their personal experiences.  Students will be able to intertwine  creative writing along with factual information. Academic and creative writing journals will help students in developing ideas  as well as fluency in their writing.  Students will also increase their vocabulary stamina by keeping a personal word wall and  taxonomy. Graphic organizers and mapping outlines will also be used to facilitate the writing process by keeping students  organized at all times.  Peer editing through checklists and rubrics will also allow students to pinpoint grammar and  punctuation as well.  Students will feel confident using strategies such as organizing, predicting, summarizing, and self- monitoring during writing.  Teachers will also provide students with writing assignments that allow them to create a personal  bridge or connecting between prior knowledge and the new information.     c. Developing  4-6 years: Continuing to keep the curriculum rigorous and challenging for these ELLs who have been receiving services.  It is  important to continue the support by making all work age-appropriate and ideal. Continuing to make lessons meaningful  where students are able to continue to make a bridge or connection from the prior knowledge to the new information. The  ESL teacher continues to communicate with content area teachers directly in meetings or by a circluating conference sheet  indirectly to provide support across all modalities in different subject areas.     d. Long Term  The Long Term ELLs of P.S./I.S. 171 are continually receiving services through our Free-Standing ENL program with an  integrated and stand alone model.  Consulting long-term ELLs is an on-going process. The school based support team meets  weekly to report progress of ELL’s academically and socially to ensure that differentiated instructional strategies and  approaches are implemented to meet the needs of our learners.  Results of ELL periodic assessments, ELA, Math and Science  data is reviewed monthly by the principal, support specialist, and classroom teachers to ensure long term ELLs are making  steady progress and meeting promotional and graduation requirements.     e. Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  Former ELLs/MLLs continue to receive ENL support and services through the integrated model in core-content classes for two  years after scoring Commanding on the NYSESLAT assessment. The classroom and ENL teacher collaborate to ensure academic  English language support while reinforcing metacognitive strategies to foster independence. Student progress goals are used  to measure student progress within language and content standards along with areas in which more extensive language   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57      support is needed.       6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Teachers of ELL-SWDs use many instructional strategies and grade-level materials to develop both the social and academic  level of English. As previously described, the ENL teacher, classroom teachers and support specialists differentiate instruction  for English Language Learners through a variety of strategies and accommodations. The ENL teacher consults with the  classroom teachers to provide strategies (such as modeling, guided reading and writing, pacing, differentiated graphic  organizers ) within the regular classroom setting to ensure that ongoing needs of students are met. Support specialists meet  weekly to discuss the progress of students receiving special education services and ENL services. A comprehensive data base of  testing accommodations for students is maintained by administration and monitored closely during state and city testing.  Accommodations include extra time and alternate setting. These students are provided with specific differentiated strategies  as prescribed in their Individual Education Plans including additional accommodations for testing. Grade level materials include  differentiated and amplified texts, practice, books, manipulatives and computer based software aligned to the student's ability  and proficiency.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Our school uses curricular, instructional and scheduling flexibility to meet the diverse needs of ELL-SWDs within the least  restrictive environment. PS/IS 171 incorporates curricular, instructional and scheduling flexibility to meet the diverse needs of  English Language Learngers and Students with Disabilities in a variety of ways.  ELLs/MLLs are provided with both the  integrated and stand alone model of instruction to ensure that they receive individualized and small group instruction to meet  their ongoing needs.  In addition, ELL students participate in several after school programs such as HARLEM RBI to reinforce  previous learning.  The core curriculum for English Language Arts, Mathematics, Social Studies and Science is differentiated to  ensure that all developmental levels are met during daily instruction.  Students requiring modifications and/or  accommodations are provided with these according to individual action plans.  The ENL teachers works collaboratively with the  classroom teachers and other support specialists to plan and implement small guided groups and develop units of study that  apply appropriate differentiation for student needs in the integrated model.  Grade level teams meet weekly to develop and  revise curriculum maps reflecting state grade-level learning standards. The ENL teacher provides guidance through consulting  to ensure that ELL student needs are met.  In the same manner, the SETSS teacher works within the classroom setting and  provides individualized support to ensure that students eligible for special education services are provided with  appropriate  support as designated in their IEP’s.                8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Targeted Intervention programs for our ELLs in ELA, Math and other content areas include our extended day program where  students who require extensive attention in reading, writing, speaking and listening in English are able to attend to work with  the ESL teacher on specific instructional strategies to impact student progress. For example, vocabulary acquisition strategies,  context clue strategies, identifying the main idea, reading for author’s purpose, cause and effect strategies, RAFT writing  system, Concept Maps, VISUAL INSTRUCTIONAL PLAN strategies, cooperative learning groups etc.  Pre, mid and post  assessments are administered throughout the school year to monitor students progress and how students are applying the  strategies to increase their development of the English language. Utilizing differentiated resources and instruction during the  intervention program is also emphasized.  Other affiliated intervention programs include after school programs offered  through a variety of partnerships including GOAL, Harlem RBI, Hunter Tutorial Program where students are given the  opportunity to work hand-in-hand with a tutor on specific skills. Native language support is accessible during intervention  programs through resources such as MYON reading, Achieve3000, and Accelerated Reader during tiered group activities.        9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      P.S.171 has adopted and implemented Teacher's College Writing Program from Lucy Calkins and Codex for reading, writing,  listening and speaking to infuse the new common core standards within our curriculum, instruction and assessment practices.  As part of this process, classrooms have received non-fiction leveled libraries, interactive SmartBoards and iPads.  For math,  we have GoMath, Connected Math CMP3. Additionally, Grades 2-8 use Acheive3000 which focuses on reading and writing  about non fiction topics that can be accessed online at school and at home. Our school now has classroom sets of iPads to  increase the use of Accelerated Reader in grades K-8 as well as improved computer labs for students to take develop skills of  collaboration, communication, critical thinking and creativity.      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   Title III supplemental services have been discontinued due to the decreased number of ELL participants within our school,  therefore we have not received Title III funding.  Despite the discontinuation, all students at P.S. 171, including our English  Language Learners, can participate without cost in after school programs that provide enrichment activities, field trip  opportunities, homework assistance and tutorials. Students at the elementary and middle school level can attend the several  after school programs including GOAL, East Harlem Tutorial, Harlem Center and Summer Program. All after school programs  are held at our school from 2:30-5:00.        11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  The ELLs/MLLs at P.S. 171 are afforded equal and, often, priority access to all school programs. They participate in all cluster  specialist classes offered in the school including: Music, Technology, Physical Education / Movement, Studio-in-a-School,  school partnerships and all special assemblies (i.e. Hispanic Cultural, etc.). English Language Learners are also encouraged to  participate in our after school programs offered through a variety of partnerships including Harlem Center for Education (HCE),  Hunter Tutorial Program, and G.O.A.L. Program.  In addition, we offer C.H.A.M.P.S. Program activities for students. Other  school partnerships in which ELLs participate include: Horticultural Society, 92nd Street Y, Museum of City of New York, Lincoln  Center, Urban Advantage, Mt. Sinai and the Academy of Medicine, and Verizon Innovative Schools Initiative.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Classrooms are equipped with an extensive library of quality literature at a range of levels to provide for the developmental,  cultural and interest needs of students. These trade books are leveled using the Fountas and Pinnell system and represent a  wide range of genres including both fiction and non-fiction. Language acquisition is also supported through use of visuals,  graphic organizers, listening tapes, audio-visual materials, computer technology, hands-on resources and Visual Instructional  Plans. Lessons are formatted to be multi-sensory to ensure that visual, auditory and tactile reinforcement is provided for  students. Every classroom is also equipped with a SmartBoard and classroom set of iPads which teachers can utilize to engage  students in interactive lessons. Overhead projectors, tape recordings, DVD’s and other high-interest materials are integrated  within the context of each lesson and units of study. The computer teacher works closely with the ENL and classroom teachers  to provide suggestions for technology integration and activities to extend language skills and content learning. Specific  software programs such as Acheive3000 are incorporated within instruction to meet the individual and ongoing needs of  identified students.     13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Native language support is delivered in our Freestanding ENL program through text support such as bilingual glossaries in the  student's first language, translated dictionaries, visuals with translated labels, and several native language texts.  Many school- wide Internet resources are available in languages other than English language for students to engage with content and take  assessments. In the classroom, students are presented with an opportunities to discuss a question or assignment in their home  language before sharing a response with the whole class in English.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    Based on a student's NYISTELL and/or NYSESLAT results, required services and resources are provided according to each ELL's  grade and proficiency level as outlined in CR Part 154. Leveled reading libraries and differentiated grade-level resources are  accessible and developed in all classrooms. In addition, technology resources such as Raz Kids, Achieve 300, and IXL Math are  available to students at all times online to facilitate individually-paced learning and promote ownership of progress.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    P.S. 171 shares a building with Central Park East II Elementary School. In addition to the coordination of school resources,  facilities and school personnel, the two schools coordinate efforts to extend student access to programs and opportunities that  met ELL's academic, linguistic and socioemotional needs. Additionally, school administrators collaborate on a monthly Town  Hall Meeting Initiative.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   For newly enrolled ELL students, the ENL teacher welcomes and introduces all newcomer ELLs to teachers and students in  order to create a warm and inviting first experience at the school. Parent orientations and walk through orientations allow  parents and students to visit several classrooms in action to directly experience the student learning environment. The parent,  student and ENL teacher are often accompanied by a current ELL who can share about the school using a shared first  language.           17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    English Language Learners are P.S. 171 are offered Spanish as an elective at our school. Students who demonstrate success in  the elective course are eligible to earn high school credit through the Regents Exam in 8th grade.      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   P.S. 171 Patrick Henry Preparatory School does not currently have a dual language program for English  Language Learners. Documentation is maintained to monitor English Language Parent Choice so that  appropriate action can be taken if enrollment numbers necessitate the development of a dual language  program.     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  1. The professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school includes the ENL teacher, literacy coach, Assistant  Principals and Principal to attend professional development sessions offered by the Department of Education as well as  through private affiliated organizations to increase student achievement by meeting the diverse educational needs through a  planned and systematic approach to curriculum, instruction and assessment. Professional development at the school level is  ongoing and continuous through grade level team meetings, faculty conferences, network workshops, DOE workshops and  university affiliated programs.    2. For the 2017-2019 school year, ALL teachers receive ongoing professional development through faculty workshops, grade  level meetings that focused on differentiated instruction, common core standards and the Charlotte Danielson Framework for  Teaching.  Specific strategies were provided for students receiving special education and ENL support. Teachers continue to  meet monthly with administration to review individual student progress from data to discuss specific ‘action plan’ strategies to  improve student performance. Professional development continues to emphasize the importance of incorporating a multi-  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60         sensory approach, at the elementary level, in the implementation of lessons and units of study.  Teachers have been provided  with specific strategies related to differentiating instruction through a series of school-based professional development  workshops.  This has included demonstration lessons focused on strategies specific to English language learners and students  receiving special education services. Specific areas of focus include vocabulary across all grades, content specific words,  questioning and discussion techniques and engaging students in learning. Teachers will also be offered several workshops on  Monday afternoons focused on specific curriculum, best practices strategies and utilization of data sources. In addition,  teachers will continue to attend programs offered through the Department of Education (DOE) offerings, New York City  partnerships and university affiliated programs.       Teachers of ELLs are provided with professional development opportunities for effective literacy, math instructional strategies  aligned to the common core. Every Monday of the school year is dedicated to educating all teachers with effective strategies  and the importance of applying data analysis to support our ELLs and SWDs along with targeted skills.  The ENL teacher also  provides informal consultation at grade level team meetings to assist content area teachers with the teaching of ELL students  more effectively. Addtionally the ENL teacher provides small group professional development and consultation to new  teachers at the new teachers meeting.  For the ENL teacher, district and third-party professional learning opportunities focus  on research-based practices, compliance and ELL-specific data analysis, and adapting instruction to meet the needs of ELLs in  the general education classroom.        2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  The ENL teacher collaborates with every stakeholder in the building to continuously increase the level of rigor and effective  instruction across all content areas as it pertains to meeting the needs of English Language Learners.  The ENL teacher serves  on the Instructional Cabinet Team as well as the Professional Development Team to develop and provide in-house workshops  for staff and faculty during Monday professional development sessions. The ENL teacher attends ELL-specific professional  development provided by the Department of Education as well as through third party affiliates on specific topics such as the  "QTEL Institute for English Language Learners" , “Writing Effective Objectives for ELLs of ALL proficiency levels”, “Language  Acquisition or Learning Disability?” and “Language Progressions” which are few of many professional development  offerings.  Records of all agendas of professional development are kept on file and documented in house.  15% of all total  hours for all teachers are maintained from the Monday PD sessions, small group consultations, grade team level meetings, as  well as one-on-one conferences on ELL strategies and data analysis.               Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Parents are invited to meet with the ESL Teacher, Literacy Coach and Classroom Teacher in the spring (May, June) to discuss  student progress and set new goals for the next school year.  For students new to the school or newly identified students in  Kindergarten, meetings are held in October to set goals for the school year. These meetings are in addition to parent-teacher  conferences in November and March and ENL Parent Orientation meetings.      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.  P.S./I.S. 171 provides a variety of parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELL's that are focused on increasing  student achievement. The ELL teacher and Literacy Coach design training modules and host Parent Workshops to support  vocabulary development, reading comprehension, study skills and use of technology to reinforce learning. The workshop  materials used are translated and interpretation support provided in the dominant languages spoken by parents in the school.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61         The school hosts a Parent Orientation Night in September and provides resources for parents through online website -  www.ps171.org as well as sending home monthly newsletters across different grade levels and content areas.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Dimitres Pantelidis, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   P.S.171 Patrick Henry Prep                                                                              School DBN: 046171  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      a. When parents enroll a student at P.S./I.S. 171 Patrick Henry Preparatory School, they complete all enrollment  documentation, which includes Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey conducted by a licensed and  trained pedagogue.
