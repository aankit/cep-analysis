This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Public School 6 is dedicated to creating independent and self-motivated learners. We seek to instill in our children a  lifelong love of learning in a nurturing environment that promotes high standards. Our efforts to achieve this vision  and bring success to all students centers on instruction in literacy, mathematics, higher order thinking skills, science,  technology, the arts and social skills. We are committed to creating a partnership among parents and the school staff  and community. Ultimately, we are dedicated to providing the foundation necessary for our children to become  responsible citizens in an ever-changing society.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9         2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    As described in our mission statement, P.S. 6 is “committed to creating a partnership among parents and the school  staff and community.” We consider our school to be a place where teaching and learning is a continuous cycle by  students, parents and teachers. We have worked to ensure quality professional development is embedded into all our  practices and that all stakeholders have a voice toward the positive trajectory that P.S. 6 is on. We believe that the  definition of rigor is deeper than what you teach and the standards you cover; it’s about how we teach and how  students demonstrate their deep understanding of the content. We strive to create an environment that is conducive  for growth, focused on high expectations and allows students to demonstrate their learning. We are committed to  creating a partnership among parents and the school staff and community. Ultimately, we are dedicated to providing  the foundation necessary for our children to become responsible citizens by being safe, responsible and respectful.   We are proud to be affiliated with Teacher Center, which is sponsored by The United Federation of Teachers (UFT).  With our partnership we have been able to secure a full-time Math coach to further support our belief in P.S. 6 being  a teaching and learning community. The Math coach supports staff, students and parents around the rigorous  Common Core Learning Standards through lesson studies, workshops and planning time.   Teachers and teacher teams use a variety of data including authentic student work to place students in small groups  to address their individual learning needs. The Integrated Collaborative Teaching model (ICT), enables the majority of  the 30% Special Education population we service to receive a quality education.   Our community believes in a continuum of personal development for our students, staff and community that is  coherent in its attempt to systematically address the many developmental needs of all stakeholders. The  organizational structures we have established incorporate a multi-faceted approach to fulfilling these needs. The  progression of building blocks focuses on crucial interrelated areas for overall development. It is our belief that this  holistic approach develops the whole child; creating productive, well-intentioned and compassionate citizens.    3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.         For the last six years we have developed content specialists in the 5th grade based on the depth and breadth of the  Common Core Standards. We departmentalized our 5th grade to consist of two ELA/Social studies specialists and two  math/science specialists. The students are shared between two teachers, who collaborate around the academic and  social and emotional needs of their students. Our teachers collaborate around content as well as grade level  concerns. Three years ago we added two Special Education Content Specialists for our two 5th grade ICT classes (one  math/science and one reading/writing and social studies). In addition, we have identified priority standards, which  our students struggle with on the ELA and Math State Tests. We measure student mastery of these standards through  the administration of common formative assessments. Progress is tracked through the administration of pre and post  assessments. Through careful data analysis we address the gaps in student understanding that cause students to fall  behind. We are able to benchmark and measure the improvements throughout grades 3, 4 and 5. We are also fully  departmentalized in fourth grade. With two ICT classes on the grade, we were able to create an ELA/Social studies  and Math/Science general education specialist for these classes. In addition, the special education teachers in these  ICT classes are also content specialists (one in math/science and one in reading/writing and social studies).   Over the course of the past six years, we have grown our arts program exponentially. We currently spiral instruction  in all four of the arts disciplines- music, dance, theater, and visual arts throughout the grades. Students enjoy  residencies in the aforementioned areas, and are afforded the opportunity to explore during culturally relevant field  trips. At P.S. 6, the arts are inextricably entwined with academics; both are integral to the development of the "whole  child."   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      At Public School 6, we have a specialized program for children with autism spectrum disorder. This language-rich  program incorporates social skills development and strategies for processing sensory information. We utilize a multi- sensory behavioral approach in the natural setting while prioritizing grade level academics. The teachers and  therapists receive specialized training and work in concert with a behavioral coach to increase student outcomes.  Students are selected for this program subsequent to a comprehensive, multidisciplinary evaluation process.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   When reflecting on the Framework for Great Schools, we are proud of the achievements we have made in rigorous  instruction and collaborative teachers. In the 2015-2016 school year, P.S. 6 embarked on a learning partnership with  I.S. 34 focused around rigorous instruction and collaborative teaching. Together, we examined the Common Core  Standards through best practices, lesson studies, inter-visitations and professional learning. Our hope is that we can  bridge the gap from elementary to middle school through quality teaching and learning. During the 2016-2017 school  year we continued this learning partnership. The partnership with intermediate school has helped us to bridge the  gap as students move into the next phase of their education. In the 2017-2018 school year we partnered with PS 5, PS  1, and PS 57 to deepen our work with multi-step problem solving in mathematics.    Our goal is for students to master the craft of being self-directed learners focusing on reflection and independence.  To achieve this goal, students and teachers together will continue to develop clear, rigorous learning intentions and  success criteria in all content areas throughout the year. In order to assist students in ownership of their learning  journey, specific focus will be given to the development of student self- assessment and peer assessment criteria and  practices. This will help to ensure that all students are aware of their learning and their necessary next steps toward  mastery.

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     PS6 has many strengths in the area of rigorous instruction. We use structures thoughtfully to leverage available time.  Teachers work collaboratively during the Monday professional development time, revising curriculum maps to reflect  current student needs. Impact Teams meet periodically to analyze student work and develop instructional plans for  groups of students. In our 2017-18 School Quality Guide, we have an overall 4.49 out of 5 rating. We scored 0.84  higher than the district and 0.80 above the city average. For the Framework component rigorous instruction, survey  response from teachers were scored at 100% when asked about Common Core shifts in both literacy and math.   Our school has conducted a comprehensive needs assessment to identify student performance trends in  Mathematics. We have analyzed quantitative data sources, such as 2017 NYS Mathematics Test Data, Common  Formative Assessments, and Unit of Study Summative Assessments. Our focus this year is on Danielson 3C to improve  student engagement, rigor and differentiation. A summary of the results is detailed below:   Priority Standards for the 2017-2018 School Year   These standards were identified vertically for third, fourth, and fifth grade scores. In addition, analysis of the data  identified standards that were tested frequently, and standards that are necessary to master as a foundation for  mastery of additional mathematics standards.   Based on a comprehensive review of this data, which has been disseminated to staff as well as members of the School  Leadership Team, we have identified the following standards in grades three through five as a priority need in the  area of rigorous instruction. These standards reflect the major multi-step problem solving standards for each grade.  These standards require students to be able to apply their mathematical knowledge when solving real world  problems.    Standard  2017 State Test Percentage Correct  2018 State Test Percentage Correct   3.OA.8   4.OA.1   56   43   5.MD.1  44      57   72   58   An area of need within the 2017-18 School Quality Guide survey results was identified by a 79% teacher response rate  to "students provide constructive feedback to their peers and teachers." This has been a focus area for the school   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13      over the past three years. It is an embedded component within our school-wide bottom lines. Teachers have been  reflective of their Advance feedback in regard to constructive feedback and student self/peer assessment. teachers  are asked to craft one professional goal relative to Danielson component 3D each year.   As evidenced by the data above, gains have been made, leaving additional room for improvement. For this reason, we  will continue to focus on these standards as priority standards for the 2018-2019 school year.        Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.

Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible  for implementation and oversight.  Parents and families will be supported in their understanding of the standards and the means by which their children  can demonstrate mastery by attending workshops that explicitly model this work during the Tuesday Parent  Engagement time. In addition, parents will be able to actively participate in “coaching” their children as they complete  the monthly math problem with their child. The principal, assistant principal, and teacher center coach will support  this endeavor and oversee the process.   Parents have attended a September 13, 2018 Curriculum Conference to inform them of the expectations for the  grade. In November and March, parents will attend parent/teacher conferences during which teachers can familiarize  parents with the priority standards and engage them in supporting the work at home. In May, parents will attend  Student Led Conferences where each student will explain his or her progress, reflecting on accomplishments, and  setting short and long-term goals. The weekly parent engagement time will also be used to support parents in  understanding academic expectations.        Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment   Part  4a.

Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement  planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal.  There will be a minimum of two administrations of teacher created common formative assessments aligned to the  priority standards. These will occur in the Fall-Winter and Spring. After each administration, student work will be  sorted into four categories (Exceeding, Meeting, Approaching, and Below). The percentage of students falling into  each category will be recorded.      After an instructional plan has been carried out, students will be re-assessed, and the student work sorted into the  same four categories. A comparison will be made to determine the amount of progress made.     After the first administration, a review of the process will be conducted to determine what, if any, alterations need to  be made to the Common Formative Assessment and P.S. 6 Professional Development plan.      Mid-point Benchmark   In February, a common formative assessment will be administered to students at which time we expect to see a  minimum of 65% of students showing progress as measured by the pre and post administration.   Following the February administration, teachers will engage in the EAA Impact Team protocol to determine student  progress. Based on evidence from the analysis of student work, we will determine if we are progressing toward the  goal, and make revisions to the action plan as necessary.     Part 5b.

Our school has conducted a comprehensive needs assessment to identify how we can support our school community  to promote our Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) motto of being Respectful, Responsible and Safe  learners and citizens. We have analyzed our quantitative data source, the Online Occurrence Reporting System  (OORS).    In the 2017-2018 school-year, 49% of our infractions against the discipline code were physically aggressive behaviors,  shoving, pushing or engaging in a minor altercation or similar physical confrontational behavior towards students or  school personnel. 11% of our infractions against the discipline code involved students using profane or vulgar  language and/or verbally rude and disrespectful behavior towards one another.   Based on this data, all constituent groups have identified the need for students to experience explicit instruction  around social and emotional competencies. The Sanford Harmony program focuses on five interrelated sets of  cognitive, affective and behavioral competencies: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship  skills, and responsible decision-making.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment.

As we progress through the 21st century, it becomes more and more important for our students to be exposed to  computer science experiences and training. Computer Science for All is an initiative of the Department of Education  that District 31 has embraced. As such, we have been invited to participate in Cohort 2 of this initiative for the 2018- 2019 school year.    Technology integration has been a focus at PS 6 for the past two years. To date, 5 classes utilize 1:1 devices in daily  instruction. This will increase to 8 classes for the 2018-2019 school year. Classes also have the opportunity to sign out  and borrow technology carts as needed. Google Classroom is used as a device for increasing student engagement, as  well as making it easier for teachers to differentiate instruction.   Although we have integrated technology into our instruction, we have not specifically focused on computer science  education. As new technologies are developed, the jobs we are preparing students for will certainly require  knowledge of computer science.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.  Indicate in Column B, section  references where a related program activity  has been described in this plan.   Column A   Column B   Verify with an (X)   Section Reference(s)   Title I Part A (Basic)   Title II, Part A   Title III, Part A   Title III, Immigrant   Tax Levy (FSF)   Federal   Federal   Federal   Federal   Local                                                  1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37     Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 6, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student  Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the  connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed  to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of  their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and  Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   P.S. 6 will support parents and families of Title I students by:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;      Parental Involvement and School Quality  To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  At P.S. 6, early literacy is assessed using TCRWP Running Records. The students are formally assessed three times a year  (November, February, and May) and tracked in TC Assessment Pro. This assessment provides teachers with information about  student phonetic and decoding skills and provides insight as to the student reading level. In addition students are informally  assessed using teacher created assessments, in small group and individual conferences and by portfolio review.  Teachers use  this quantitative data to group students in appropriate guided reading groups.  In addition, the information is used to provide  differentiated instruction as needed.  Grades K - 2 use Fundations to promote phonemic awareness skills.     Struggling students are brought to the attention of the Pupil Personal Team (PPT).  The PPT meets weekly, Wednesday’s at  9:30, and they decide upon the appropriate interventions to be implemented. Students continue to be monitored by teachers  and support staff. Progress, regression or stagnation is reported within close time lines monitored by the teachers and the  PPT. The students are re-assessed often to either be removed from monitoring when appropriate progress is achieved or   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      further interventions are discussed.      This data shows that many of our ELL students are performing below grade level. This informs our school plan by helping us  choose interventions that will move ELL student’s progress at a quicker pace than their peers so they can catch up to grade  level.

What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   At P. S. 6, parallel teaching with both our ICT special education and ENL teacher during the minilesson is the structure we have  in place to support this effort.  Our ENL students are heterogeneously grouped throughout the grade but are taught in small  groups.  We demonstrate, motivate, and encourage student engagement during the minilesson.  The minilesson is ten minutes  long in which ENL students are grouped in partnerships to turn and talk before they go off to work on an independent  task.  While students are working independently, a small group of approximately four are pulled for guided reading or to learn  a strategy.  Individual conferencing takes place at this time to coach children on strategies they are struggling with or to check  student progress.  As we parallel teach, we pace our classroom lessons for 45 minutes a day, 180 minutes per week to comply  with the Part 154 mandate as part of the integrated services for ELA for our Beginning and Emerging Language Learners, and  90 minutes per week to comply with the Part 154 mandate for ELA for our Transitioning, Expanding, and Commanding  ELLs.  The Entering and Emerging ELLS who receive stand alone instruction by grade get pulled out to a separate classroom for  45 minutes per day, 180 minutes a week to comply with the stand alone Part 154 mandate, and our Transitional leveled  learners are serviced at a separate location for 90 minutes per week.  In addition, our ENL teachers have the opportunity to  meet with teachers in each grade during our Monday/Tuesday planning time.  Another structure is the utilization of our  Monday and Tuesday PD/OPW time.  During this time the ENL teacher plans and articulates with the classroom teachers.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We use several data sources, both large-scale and classroom, to evaluate the success of our ELL program. The Bilingual  Progressions are used in order to monitor students’ progress towards meeting the CCLS that are aligned to a unit of study. As a  result of employing several formative assessment tools teachers are able ascertain the receptive and productive increases in  ENL student learning. Some assessment tools are: conference notes, written responses and student self-assessments. In  addition teachers use the Bilingual Progressions to scaffold reading lessons for ENL students with different needs. Students are  then evaluated using Teachers College Running Records, Spelling Inventory and High Frequency Word list. This data is captured  in Teachers College Assessment Pro. This data is disaggregated for sub-groups. The analysis of this data is another way we  formativly evaluate our ENL program in order to adjust instruction.  ENL methodologies are used in all classes to provide access  to rigorous content for all learners.  The NYS ELA and Math Test item skill analysis are analyzed in order to prioritize instruction  to evaluate progress towards meeting AYP. Now that the NYSESLAT is aligned to the CCLS, we use it to monitor changes in  proficiency level and scale score in order to best prepare our students to meet AYP.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    P.S. 6 has structures in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered.  In addition to small group  minilesson instruction, we break up into smaller groups to support students in areas where our data has shown children  struggling; furthermore, we follow up with individual conferences.  We provide support in all content areas including Math,  Science and Social Studies assisting with tasks while providing ENL methodologies such as visuals, demonstrations, and  repetition.       5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Standardized testing data from the NYSELAT is analyzed to uncover strengths and challenges in the four modalities as aligned  to the CCLS. This data is then triangulated with other forms of formative and summative data to target learning within a give  CCLS aligned unit of study. Educators use this data to develop specific instructional strategies to meet the needs of students  within the different tiers of the RTI framework for instruction.   In Tier 1, teachers engage ELL’s in a strong instructional core that is differentiated to meet the learning needs of students as  revealed by various data sources. Teachers model higher order thinking as well as model oral fluency. Teachers incorporate  cultural background, student native language and interest in order to maximize student success at the core instructional level  of the RTI framework. Teachers continually collect data to monitor the progress of the receptive and productive domains of  learning. They also monitor content learning as well as language development. Teachers use various assessment measures   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49      suitable for the language proficiency level of the ENL student. Some examples are cloze paragraphs, matching, labeling, oral  interviews, conferencing and exit slips. Gradually more summative assessment data is collected, for example unit tests and  performance tasks to determine continued intervention needs.   If intensive intervention is needed, the student will receive targeted instruction based on core teacher’s recommendation and  documentation. The stakeholders involved with this student’s education will continuously monitor progress of targeted  instructional goals.  Benchmarks and learning goals will incorporate knowledge of new language acquisition while aligning to  the CCLS. Students will be supported based on individual need in order to evaluate learning issues.

What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The current data indicates that students are strongest in speaking portions of the 2016 NYSESLAT administration, followed by  Listening and Reading.  Writing is the weakest area of all modalities.       One pre-kindergarten student was tested using the NYSITELL’s early administration window for September 2017. One student  was determined to be an ELL student.  Her home language is Spanish.     The state ELA and Math tests were taken by ten ELL students.  The results are detailed below:    MohammadAlrafati  Noha Elbahlawan  Diana Keliza  Roller Maceda  Jose Alvarez  Angel Gomez  Magdelena Gomez  Marco Estafanous  Alizon Martinez        7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   ELA, Math, Science and NYSESLAT data is shared with all staff at our first faculty conference.  School leaders share results,  discuss possible next steps, along with implications for instruction. for all students, including ELLs.  In addition, bottom lines are  created each year to deepen the instructional work and foci for all of our students.  Monday planning time is dedicated to  professional development and the analysis of student work/data to inform instructional practice.  Data trends are analyzed  and shared with grade leaders during our bi-monthly meetings.      Through the Advance observation process, school leaders ensure that staff is implementing the structures that have been  determined to be necessary to meet the needs of our ELL students.  Feedback sessions with teachers include reflections based  upon each lesson and changes/modifications that could be made to improve student outcome.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.           We have a free standing ENL program at PS6.  Students are grouped heterogeneously in general education  classes. Each grade also has an ICT class. There are two ICT classes in kindergarten, fourth and fifth grade.  ELL  Students in grades K-5 are in multiple classes. Many of our ELLs are in 12:1 classes with two grades in each class or in  ICT classes across the grades. Therefore, all ELLs are in many different classes. To meet the mandated minutes of   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52         instruction the ELLs that require Stand Alone Instruction are placed in groups of two consecutive grades. There are  two ENL teachers. One teacher is a full-time ENL teacher working under her TESOL Certification.  The other teacher  works under her Common Branch License and also holds a TESOL Certification.  Each day students are served in a  stand alone model and an integrated model. The ENL teachers either pull groups into a  separate classroom for stand- alone instruction or pushes into a classroom to service children that require integrated instruction.  At P.S 6, we  presently have five students who are at Entering/Emerging Levels.  They receive four integrated periods of instruction  and four stand-alone periods, a total of 360 minutes per week.  We have five students who are at Transitioning Levels  in grades K, second, third, and fourth;  they receive two stand-alone and two integrated periods of ENL Services which  total 180 minutes per week.  We also service eleven students in grades 1-5 who have scored at an Expanding Level on  the NYSESLAT and receive 180 minutes per week of integrated instruction.  In addition, we service two students  in  grades second and third who have reached Commanding Levels and receive two integrated periods per week for a  total of 90 minutes of instruction.  Students in K-1 are grouped together during stand-alone instruction.  Students in  grades 2-3 are grouped together for stand-alone instruction, and presently there are no students in our 4-5 group  who are entitled to stand-alone services.  Our fourth and fifth grade students have reached Expanding Levels and are  entitled to integrated services only.      b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A   2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?              ELLs within each classroom have various proficiency levels in terms of language proficiency, literacy levels and student’s  home languages. Teachers are attentive to these differences and design instruction accordingly.  Using the NYSITELL for new  admits and the NYSESLAT results for others, instructional time is determined for each individual student.  Our Entering  Level  and Emerging Level students are presently in kindergarten, second and third grade.  They receive four integrated periods  of instruction and four stand alone periods, a total of 360 minutes per week.    We have five students at Transitioning Levels in  grades second, third and fourth and who receive two stand-alone and two integrated periods of ENL Services which total 180  minutes per week. We also service eleven students in grades 1-5  who have scored at an Expanding Level on the NYSESLAT and  receive 180 minutes per week of integrated instruction.  In addition, we service two students  in grades second and third who  hasve excelled to a Commanding Level and receive two integrated periods per week for a total of 90 minutes of  instruction.  Students in K-1 are grouped together during stand-alone instruction.  Students in grades 2-3 are grouped together  for stand-alone instruction, and for the 2017/18 school year our students in grades 4- 5 have progressed to Expanding levels;  therefore, are entitled to only integrated periods of instruction in their classrooms.       3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.      In the integrated classroom, ENL methodologies are utilized to address the language and academic achievement needs of our  students. Building and tapping into background knowledge is a priority embedded in instruction. Multicultural norms and  customs are part of the learning and considered when planning.  The Bilingual progressions are used to scaffold instruction  and provide linguistic supports to students at various levels of language proficiency. Teachers also incorporate students'  existing home language skills to enhance achievement. In addition opportunities for academic language instruction and  student interactions has been increased.  Other supports to increase comprehensible input, such as visuals, word banks and  graphic organizers, are a standard part of planning for and delivering instruction in our ENL program.      The integrated classroom is primarily a co-teaching model. This model allows the delivery of content to be differentiated by  content, process or product. It allows for small group instruction and /or two teachers as lead teachers delivering instruction   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      for different groups of students based on need.             Our ENL teachers provide integrated instruction to ENL students using the above, described methodologies. Our  ENL teacher also provides stand- alone ENL instruction to develop students’ English language skills. Some of the instructional  foci are: phonemic awareness, fluency building, English Language Conventions, Dictionary /and bilingual glossary use for  support. Guided Reading is also an integral part of our stand-alone model.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?      As stated above, a student’s existing home language skills are used, as well as formatively assessed, to maximize academic  achievement of our ELL students. The Home Language Arts Progressions are used to monitor a student’s home language  literacy skills. Instructional resources and assessments are translated as needed to foster both English Language development  and home language literacy.  Parents are given instructional materials in their preferred language where available to assist and  contribute to their child’s English Language development and home language literacy.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    a.Sife - Currently there are no SIFE students at PS6.     b. Newcomers – ELL students receiving services from 0-3 years  Newly identified ELL’s require specific instruction to gain the skills to successfully integrate a new language. Such as but are not  limited to:  - Exposure to daily reading of   •     Picture based books with limited text  •     Books that contain repetitive, predictable phrases  •     Books that have high frequency words and simple sentences.      - Teachers will support students' comprehension as much as possible by   •     reading sentences at a slow-to-normal speed, using an expressive tone  •     Pointing to the words in the text as they are read. This is particularly useful for students who need to learn the left-to-right  flow of English text  •     Pointing to the corresponding pictures as they are read   •     Acting out the story   •     The use of visuals, utilizing Google images, SMART boards and ipads along with manipulatives and "realia."   •     While reading teachers will verify comprehension of the story by asking newcomer students to show what they know by  pointing to items in the illustrations and asking simple comprehension questions with yes/no and either/or questions at first,  and then move to fill-in-the-blank or who/what/when/where/why questions when students are more comfortable.   •     The teacher will read the same story on successive days and pause at strategic points and invite students to supply the  words or phrases they know. Newcomer students once familiar with the story will often begin to engage in reading the text  along with the teacher and class as you are pointing to the words.   •     Teachers will use big books, large poster texts and the SMART board where both the text and illustrations can be easily  seen.  - The ENL teacher and classroom teacher will also take the time, if necessary, for the English alphabet to be taught.  Remembering that pre-literate students and newcomers schooling may vary dramatically when they speak a language that  does not use the Roman alphabet, which at PS6 included Spanish, Arabic, and Russian. These students may require direct  instruction of letter recognition, formation and beginning phonics.   - Phonics will also be taught with context. Using literature and material concepts such as letter recognition, beginning and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      ending sounds, blends, rhyming words, silent letters, homonyms and more. When useful and purposeful phonic and grammar  worksheet may be used to reinforce new phonetic skills.   - Teachers will check student’s comprehension frequently because all though the student may decode accurately they have  not been able to construct meaning out of the words they have read. Newcomers will be taught strategies to self-monitor their  reading. Comprehension can be checked with the following activities:  •     Graphic organizers – visual depictions of information allow ELLs to better understand the material while learning  important vocabulary.   •     Write individual sentences from the text on separate sheets of drawing paper and have the students read each sentence  and illustrate it.  •     Have student sequence material from a story: print sentences from a section of the story on paper strips, mix the strips;  have students put them in order.  •     Check students' ability to order words within a sentence; write several sentences from the text on individual strips of  paper; cut the strips into words; have students arrange each group of words into a sentence.     - Teachers will use audiobooks for ELL students. Using books on CD, the Internet, or podcasts of the stories you are reading in  class. If the stories haven't been recorded, set up a tape recorder and record stories as you read. Newcomers will have the  opportunity to listen to a story and read along as many times as they wish.     - The ENL teacher, the home class teacher and parent coordinator will work with the parents and family to support home  language literacy and encourage reading outside the classroom. By encouraging the families’ utilization of CBO’s, the public  library and more. Along with grade and proficiency level books sent home from the school.     - When deemed appropriate the ENL teacher and class teacher will create individualized activity packs for newcomers. These  activity packs will enable entry-level students to work independently on activities suited to their specific needs, such as  phonics practice or vocabulary exercises. The students will be encouraged to work on these activities when they cannot follow  the work being done in the classroom. Remember, however, not to isolate the newcomers from their peers with separate  work all day long. They, too, need to be a part of your class and should be integrated as much as possible.     - When deemed appropriate the ENL teacher and class teacher will create learning centers for newcomers where they in turn  will be able to teach their classmates about their home language. These centers will include maps, the alphabet, words and  items appropriate to the newcomers and their home language.      c. Developing – ELL students with 4-6 years services  These ELL students, in addition to having some of the needs newcomers have, need further interventions and strategies used  to bolster language acquisition. This is also the time teachers and administration have to be diligent about taking the steps to  determine a language acquisition need vs. a learning disability.   These students need:  -     To be able to “unpack” unfamiliar vocabulary using the tools available to them such as both bilingual and English language  dictionaries, glossaries, technology, using context clues and more  -     To be exposed to different levels of text complexity and be given the skills and strategies to fully comprehend the texts.  -     To have language specific goals to increase literacy and fluency  -     To have content specific information scaffolded for them  -     To be taught academic English when speaking and writing  -     All newcomer strategies for comprehension will be utilized at a higher language proficiency level  -     Continued use of modeled academic writing with small group instruction, individual conferences and graphic organizers to  support success     d. Long-term – Since PS6 is a K-5 school there can be no ELL’s in the building with 6 or more years of service     e. Former ELL’s - up to two years after exiting ELL status  These students are serviced with the new mandate of .5 units of study. Depending on their grade and needs their minutes are   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      served within the Science period or integrated period in their classrooms. They are given various supports to bridge and  residual gaps they may have in their language acquisition.   In addition to all of the above strategies these students need instruction in:  -     Specific language skills taught  -     Higher Order Thinking Skills  -     English Language structure   -     Tier 3 Vocabulary instruction          6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?           Eureka Math is used as a resource and tool to enable students to master math standards. This is a grade level, UDL  designed program that includes differentiation strategies for classroom application. Teachers align this program to the CCLS  and use the Bilingual progressions to scaffold instruction for ELL students.            We utilize the Teachers College Reading and Writing Program as our primary resource for ELA instruction. Students are  exposed to grade level texts and tasks that are scaffolded appropriately according to new language development and  proficiency.             Engaging in thematic units of study, accessing and building prior knowledge, choosing academic vocabulary to enhance  comprehension, increasing comprehensible input and student interactions are some instructional strategies used to provide  access to content and and foster language development for SWD’s and ELL ‘s.            Smartboards create interactive learning opportunities and iPads are used to reinforce concepts and provide differentiated  and adaptive learning experiences for Students within certain sub-groups.            All teachers have access to any student's IEP that they teach. IEP’s are consulted regularly to assure that appropriate  services are being given as well as to monitor progress to IEP Learning objectives.        7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  The use of the curricular at PS6 for ELLs that are SWDs is the same as the NYS mandated curricular for the students’ grade  level.  In the classrooms teachers are required to design learning opportunities that integrate reading, writing, speaking and  listening within the practices of each discipline.  Because of the large number of ICT classes SWDs spend time with their non- disabled peers.      ELL-SWDs are placed in ICT classes in order to ensure a least restrictive environment. Scheduling flexibility is adhered to in  order to assure ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and attain English proficiency.  PS 6 has an ICT class for each grade.  Students continue in these classes unless it is determined that they need a 12:1 class if they are unable to meet rigorous, grade  level academic standards  of the ICT class.  .      8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Our targeted intervention program is an RTI model.  Wilson trained teachers support the RTI program.  Daily exit tickets in  math are utilized to form small groups for remediation.  Fundations is used in the lower grades to address phonemic  awareness.  Goalbook and Front Row are used to differentiate and support students on all levels,  Paraprofessional support is  given to students in small groups.  Science teachers provide small group instruction to students as needed.  All intervention  programs are offered in English.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56         9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      P.S. 6 uses the Journeys Reading Program in K-2 classes.  Grades 3-5 use TCRWP for Reading and incorporates Junior Grade  Books.  All grades K-5 use TCRWP for Writing.  Wordly Wise is incorporated for vocabulary instruction for Tier 1-3  words.  Fundations is used in grades K-2 to develop phonemic awareness.  Accessing Complex Text will be introduced in grades  3-5, with a companion program for grades 1-2.  In Math, Eureka Math is used for grades K-5.  Eureka Math is a UDL designed  program with specific suggestions for differentiation for our ELL's.  For the upcoming school year, we will be utilizing Goal  Books.     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All after school programs are available to all students. LatchKey is offered after school every day as an extension of the school  day. After school sports such as basketball, flag football, etc. are offered throughout the year. Different subject based clubs  such as drama, math, cooking and art are also offered after school.     12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Various instructional materials are used to support ELLs.  ELLs are exposed to materials such as visual aids, glossaries, and  books aligned to their individual reading level.  The reading and writing program as well as Eureka Math have an ELL  component built in for ELLs.  Furthermore, technology is used through Smart boards with computer based interactive lessons  for literacy, math, science and social studies.  P.S. 6 also has a school messenger system and a school web-site that are always  viable resources for ELLs to access school information.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Native language support is delivered in P.S. 6’s ENL program by the use of content area glossaries, bilingual dictionaries, visual  aids and technology.  In addition, books are provided in the student’s native language in the classroom and at home to support  literacy.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All service providers and classroom teachers collaborate to best support ELLs.  Classroom teachers and service providers share  materials to reinforce lessons through multiple entry points..  All teachers of ELLs are aware of the age, grade level, and  language proficiency of their students, so they can best assist them in reaching language proficiency and goals. The Bilingual  Progressions are used to develop a targeted approach to instruction based on the language proficiency of each individual  student.    The ENL teacher submits her program to school leadership.  Administrators carefully review the program to ensure that  student mandates are met.  In addition, both city and state reports are analyzed throughout the school year to continually  monitor compliance.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    N/A     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   Newly enrolled ELL students meet with the ENL teacher at registration.  The ENL teacher conducts an information interview  and provides assistance in filling out the home language survey.  Parents of NYSITELL eligible ELLs will be informed by the ENL  teacher that their child will be tested for ENL within 10 days of enrollment.  At the time of the interview parents are able to ask  any questions they may have regarding their child.   In addition, an ENL parent orientation meeting is also for newly enrolled   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57         ELLs.  Registration support is also provided by the Pupil Accounting Secretary.     In September, the parents are invited to a curriculum night where the grade specific teachers lead workshops about the  curriculum for the year.   In October, the parents are invited to attend a school day during open school week to see what a  typical day for their student is like.         17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?   No language electives are offered at this time.     18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  The ENL teacher attends the Division of School Support and Instruction professional development meetings provided by the  Borough Field Support offices and meetings by the office of English Language Learners when applicable.  The ENL teacher and  the Principal attend professional development meetings and turn-key the information to classroom teachers.  The classroom  teachers will continue to attend all mandated ENL professional development hours as needed.    Teachers of ELL’s are part of the DELL’s Office e-mail blast and are offered to attend trainings that they feel will benefit their  instruction.  Professional Development will be offered to integrate the information available in the Bilingual progressions.     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  All teachers are aware of the 15% of ENL training required.   The principal keeps a Professional Development log of all PD that  is attended throughout the year as well as agendas and attendance sheets.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:                                                                                   School DBN:     Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.
