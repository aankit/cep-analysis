The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will  provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state  accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong  Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools  centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school  leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed.  Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to  Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational  Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous  improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis  of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies  that improve outcomes for students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase  student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework  for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members  concrete ways to improve.   In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with  2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement.   The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.     Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for  School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets, the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other  quantitative and qualitative data tools.    NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets   To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the  current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple  instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent  statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure  how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district  will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus  Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and  Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.     The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an  effective school and school district across the following six tenets:     Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity    Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions    Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support    Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions    Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and    Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement    NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             8      Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)   I.

The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.     Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)   Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the  1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance  on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.     Next Steps for SCEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE   Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT)  School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not  undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most  recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data.     Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed  by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART  – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             9      monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 6: Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title   I schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.     Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             10         1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Section 4: SCEP Overview      The South Bronx Academy for Applied Media (SBAAM) is committed to providing a quality education in a small, safe,  disciplined and caring environment where scholars and adults are meaningfully engaged in learning. Our entire  learning community promotes logical and creative thinking and caters to all developmental levels. The curriculum  design and instructional practices help scholars to connect academic learning to applied learning in the real world.  Upon graduation, scholars will be academically prepared to make informed decisions about their roles in our changing  society, and they will be equipped to meet the challenges of higher education, careers and life.      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    The South Bronx Academy for Applied Media (SBAAM) serves 250 scholars in grades 6-8. 63.4% of scholars are  Hispanic or Latino and 33.6% of scholars are Black or African American. 82% of scholars receive free or reduced lunch.   Our collaborative partners include Partnership with Children, Good Shepherd Services, St. Barnabas Hospital,  Teachers College Columbia University, Syracuse University, City University of New York (CUNY), Big Brothers Big  Sisters of New York City, Multicultural Music Group, Teachers and Writers Collaborative, Young Artist Development  Program, Broadway Junior and Lincoln Center Education.   We are proud to be a part of the following initiatives: Middle School Quality Initiative (MSQI), Learning Partners  Program and Extended Learning Time (ELT). Our strengths lie in our strategic collaborations. Our Summer in the City,  formerly known as Summer Quest initiative has addressed summer learning loss and has provided a stimulating  academic and social environment for scholars on all grade levels. Similarly, we have witnessed an elevated  appreciation for reading and discussing books since we have implemented strategic reading within ELA classes in  every grade as a part of the Middle School Quality Initiative and newly implemented last year, strategic math.  Furthermore, we have experienced the favorable results with our Extended Learning Time program in partnership  with Good Shepherd Services. Based on staff feedback, the former grade 6 scholars have entered the 7 th grade with  excellent study habits and an increased level of maturity and responsibility. Finally, as a participating school in Arts in  the Middle and our partnership with Lincoln Center Education, we are able to enhance arts experiences for scholars,  families and staff.       3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   30% of scholar population have special needs and they require services such as SETSS, Speech and Language and  Counseling.   13% of scholar population are Limited English Proficient   10% of scholar population take the Common Core Algebra and Living Environment Regents Exams      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   While we have made gains in our levels of proficiency in English Language Arts and Mathematics, this still remains one  of our biggest challenges. Our 2018 NYS ELA and Math exam results indicate that we successfully increased scholar  proficiency in both subject areas. As we noticed a slight increase in our scholars who attained a level one, as a school  community we need to improve on synthesizing scholar data and devising next steps to address deficit skills. We  firmly believe that more focus in this area will yield higher levels of scholar proficiency and an increased number of  scholars who will meet and exceed grade level standards..    2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             11         Strengths: (1) Collaborative Teachers; (2) Effective School Leadership; (3) Trust   Areas of focus: (1)Rigorous Instruction; (2) Strong Family & Community Ties            2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 07X296   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   253   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

ELT provides enriching  educational experiences that happen outside of the traditional school day and blend skill acquisition, relationship- building and fun to foster academic and social-emotional growth. Summer learning, afterschool programming, and  extended-day ELT models, when well-implemented, play a critical role in supporting students in all grades and ensuring  that they graduate from high school, college and career ready. SED requires that Priority schools offer a minimum of 200  additional student contact hours as Expanded Learning Time in addition to the current mandated length of 900 hours of  instruction per year (25 hours per week) in grades K-6 and 990 hours of instruction per year (27.5 hours per week) in  grades 7-12. Effective ELT models will blend school staff with community partners, and will provide a balanced  curriculum that can include ELA, Math, STEM, arts, physical activity, and leadership development.

The Instructional Leadership and Assessment Team meets on a weekly basis to identify and discuss multiple and  common assessment measures. The team devises a school wide assessment calendar and revisits it on a regularly to  ensure that scholars are not over tested. The ILAT also factors in dates for teachers to score and analyze assessments  within their content area teams. During common planning meetings, teacher teams collectively determine  assessments to be administered to scholars.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its  Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program  contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,  State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the  amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met  the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified   through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with  district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.      Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             45        Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.     Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and      more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.     Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be   used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             46      Section 10: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. South Bronx Academy for Applied Media, in compliance with the Section 1118  of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent  involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the  families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision- making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School  Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of  the school community         [South Bronx Academy for Applied Media] will support parents and families of Title I scholars by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             47      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             48      ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

Day PREPARATORY ACADEMY  The Day Preparatory Academy will build the ELA and Math skills of approximately 30 ELLs, as  well  as prepare them for the NYS Math and ELA exams. Upon careful review of the 2017 NYS ELA  and Math scores and the 2017 NYSESLAT scores, many ELLs require additional academic  assistance. This program  provides the opportunity for scholars to grow academically,  particularly with respect to the development of the scholar’s skills in mathematics and  ELA through  English-language acquisition in all four modalities (speaking, listening,  reading,and writing). It therefore aims to build English-language acquisition in order to facilitate  access to learning in both core classes.  Scholars will be engaged in a variety of activities, such  as literature-based writing activities, opportunities to practice in authentic conversational  situations and writing tasks, and opportunities to improve math skills with regard to word  problems in an English speaking setting. The model of co-teaching employed will be that one  teacher will preteach and the other will teach alternative information thereby taking advantage of  the smaller ratio of 15:1 that will exist in two smaller student groups. When necessary  scaffolded resources will be provided to further understanding.    The Prep Academy runs for 17 sessions from February through June and Title III funds will be  used to fund 17 sessions. It will take place on select Tuesdays and Thursdays from 3:15 AM to  5:00 PM. An ESL-certified teacher will co-teach with an ELA teacher from 3:15 to 5:00 a.m.on  Tuesdays and then co-teach with a Math content area teacher from 3:15 to 5:00p.m.to instruct  approximately 30 ELLs in grades six through eight in this program - 1 teacher X 3.5 hours x 17  sessions = 59.5 X $55.23 = $3,286.19 and 2 teachers x 1.75 hours x 17 sessions = 59.5 X $55.23  = $3,286.19  The language of instruction will be English and teachers will use the Kaplan and  New York Coach Assessment Materials as the main curriculum for the Saturday Preparatory  Academy.  An administrator/supervisor will oversee the Saturday Preparatory Academy as there  are no other programs in the school on Saturday. Title III funds will be used to pay for 10 of  these sessions  - 1 X 3.5 x 10 = 35 X $56.79 =$1,987.65 The instructional role of the supervisor  will be to monitor classroom activities and ensure that the program runs smoothly.      RISING MULTICULTURAL CLUB  The Rising Multicultural Club will build the English-language literacy skills of approximately 15  long terms ELLs through multicultural education. It will run for 20 sessions, starting in January  and ending in May. It will take place on select Mondays  and Wednesdays  from 7 AM to 8 AM.  An ESL-certified teacher will instruct approximately 15 ELLs in grades six through eight, who   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             55            Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   scored Intermediate or Advanced on the 2017 NYSESLAT and have been in ENL for over 5  years - - 1 X 20 X $55.23 = $1,104.60.  Scholars will read and analyze a variety of multicultural  texts. The ENL teacher will use the "Stories to Celebrate" collection by Almar Flor Ada and F.  Isabel Campoy as the main curriculum of the Multicultural Club. Additional resources will be  used to supplement this curriculum, such as dictionaries, manipulatives (picture cards), and  general instructional supplies (chart paper, markers, notebooks, pencils, construction paper,  scissors, markers). The end product of this program is a pop-up book that each scholar will create  to their own multicultural stories and/or poems and the literary elements traditionally used in  many such texts. Scholars will participate in two instructional trips to cultural institutions, such  as the Museum of African Art and the Multi-cultural resource center located at CUNY City  College (which would take place during the school day), so that they further explore themes  related to the curriculum of this program. These themes include race, immigration,cultural  identity, and many more.  Strategies will be utilized to encourage familiarity with idiomatic  expressions, language that is appropriate to social situations, reinforcement of terms used in  content area instruction, and active participation in the four strands of language acquisition  (listening, speaking, reading and writing) with a focus on reading and writing.

We plan  to achieve these goals by the following means:  • Translate communications to parents/guardians of our ELLs into their native language  • Have translators available during Title III parent/guardian workshops  • Provide support through “Homework Helper” kits in several languages  Parents/guardians of ELLs are also provided with opportunities to attend professional  development sessions which are facilitated by the ESL Teacher. These workshops will focus on  supporting the ELLs participating in the Title III program by extending test-taking skill  development to their homes. Five to ten parents/guardians are expected to attend, and the ESL  teacher will facilitate these Title III family workshops. They are as follows:  -How to foster English language development at home  ((select day)February 2019 from 3:00 to 4:00 pm )  -ELLs and test-taking strategies  ((select day) Tuesday 2019 from3:00 to 4:00pm)  -Immigration/Citizenship in New York City  ((select day) Tuesday  2019 from 3:00 to 4:00pm)  Parents will be notified through flyers distributed to the scholars to take home and the  ENL teacher will make follow-up phone calls closer to the dates of the family workshops to  confirm attendance and keep records of these activities.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  At the South Bronx Academy for Applied Media, we use the Fountas and Pinnell system to assess the early literacy skills of our  ELLs. Running records are conducted once in the fall and once in the spring to find out the scholars' reading levels. Thus far,  the data has shown that the reading levels of our ELLs range from K to Z and about 70 percent of them read below grade level.  This information informs the instructional plan of the ELA and ESL teachers as they teach to the scholars' zone of proximal  development (Vygotsky, 1978), as well as build classroom libraries with materials that are appropriate to the scholars' levels.        2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Strategic Reading teachers administer assessments within their classrooms.  Academic Intervention and related services  providers also administer, analyze and synthesize scholar assessments.     2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             61         3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The success of our ELLs is quantitatively measured by various progress monitoring data, including the Fountas and Pinnell  System which includes running records that are conducted in the fall and spring to monitor students’ reading levels, the  Periodic Assessment Exam for ELLs, (also given in the fall and spring) and students’ NYSESLAT scores at the end of the school  year. The overall goal is to have ELLs attain a proficient score of Commanding on the NYSESLAT and exit ENL the following  year.  Growth is also measured when ELLs move up a proficiency level, from Entering to Emerging, Emerging to Transitioning,  and Transitioning to Expanding.  In addition, success of our ELLs is assessed on a continual basis through individual writing  portfolios that are kept and reviewed by the ENL teacher throughout the year.       4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Content area teams including the ENL teacher meet weekly to analyze and synthesize scholar data.  Within DART (Data Action  Research Team) meetings, teachers use data to determine scholar deficit skills.  Teachers then devise an action plan to address  how to help scholars improve in a specific area.  Information regarding each scholar is also updated onto our school wide  tracker so that all teachers who teach specific scholars have access.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Based on NYSESLAT and ELA data the foundation of RtI for ELLs is Tier 1, expanding students’ existing competencies to support  literacy learning and content knowledge.  Core instruction focuses on language and literacy development especially to support  reading and writing competencies.  The ENL teacher employs strategies such as building on background knowledge and  frontloading vocabulary which promotes written language development during the instructional core.  Intensive, targeted  intervention, Tiers 2 and 3, are informed by progress monitoring data, including the Fountas and Pinnell System to assess early  literacy skills, the Periodic Assessment Exam for ELLs given in the fall and spring, the NYC Performance Assessment in ELA and  other assessments designed and administered by the ENL teacher.        6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   NYSITELL data continue to reveal that the majority of scholars are Entering ELLs although some have scored in the Emerging  and Transitioning range as they were studying English in their native countries.  The most difficult aspect of English for them is  within the Reading and Writing  modalities.       Spring 2016 NYSESLAT data showed that the almost half of all ELLs this year are Expanding scholars (48%).  Almost all of these  scholars did not reach the Commanding level because of the Reading and/or Writing modalities, whereas all of them were  proficient in the Speaking modality and to a slightly less degree the Listening modality.  All 5 of the Transitioning students also  struggled in the Reading and Writing modalities.  Emerging scholars only scored proficient on the Speaking modalities.  The  breakdown by grade reveals that 50%  of the 8  th   grade scholars this year reached the Expanding level of proficiency and the  rest are split equally between Transitioning and Entering levels.  The 7  th   grade is comprised of almost all Expanding scholars  and the 6  th   grade is split equally between Expanding, Transitioning and Entering scholars.           7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The School Wide Assessment Team enters the data into a school wide tracker which is accessible to all stakeholders in the  school community.  Scholar data is discussed during weekly DART (Data Action Research Team) meetings.         Part IV: ELL Programming     2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             62      Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.    The ENL program at South Bronx Academy of Applied Media is a program that includes integrated and stand alone  components.  As mandated in the New York State CR Part 154.2, Entering ELLs are provided with 360 minutes of  instruction every week consisting of 180 minutes of integrated ENL and 180 minutes of stand-alone ENL.  Emerging  ELLs are also provided with 360 minutes of instruction every week, but with 225 minutes of integrated ENL and 135  minutes of stand-alone ENL.  Transitioning ELLs are provided with 180 minutes of instruction divided equally into 90  minutes of integrated ENL and 90 minutes of stand-alone ENL.  Expanding ELLs are  provided with 180 minutes per  week of integrated ENL instruction.  Finally, Commanding ELLs are provided with 90 minutes per week of integrated  ENL instruction.    Scholars are placed in a group based on their most recent NYSITELL or NYSESLAT scores.  The integrated component  allows the ENL teacher to push in to one of the content areas and address scholars’ different learning styles by  differentiating instruction.  Within the Integrated component of ENL,  students are grouped heterogeneously in  content-area classes and co-taught by an ENL teacher and a content-area teacher.  During these periods English skills  are built through content-area instruction focusing on the implementation of ENL strategies that enable ELLs to access  the core curriculum more successfully.  The stand-alone component is comprised of 3-16 scholars in no more than 2  contiguous grades.  The ENL teacher works on the basic linguistic building blocks of the English language and  introduces ESL strategies and methods that the scholars can use back in the content classroom to acess the Core  curriculum more effectively.                b.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   As mandated in the New York State CR Part 154.2, Entering ELLs are provided with 360 minutes of instruction every week  consisting of 180 minutes of integrated ENL and 180 minutes of stand-alone ENL.  Emerging ELLs are also provided with 360  minutes of instruction every week, but with 225 minutes of integrated ENL and 135 minutes of stand-alone ENL.  Transitioning  ELLs are provided with 180 minutes of instruction divided equally into 90 minutes of integrated ENL and 90 minutes of stand- alone ENL.  Expanding ELLs are  provided with 180 minutes per week of integrated ENL instruction.  Finally, Commanding ELLs  are provided with 90 minutes per week of integrated ENL instruction.      3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   In their content areas, ELLs receive instruction in English that is aligned to the New York State and Common Core learning  standards.  The majority of the content teachers are versed in the effective ESL methodologies and work together with the ENL  teacher to make content comprehensible and enrich language development.  Especially within the integrated component of  ENL, they present a plethora of lessons and activities that encourage communication in the classroom, as well as the use of  academic vernacular.  Additionally, lessons are modeled, contextualized, and scaffolded to maximize learning.  The common  instructional practices that content area teachers and the ENL teacher use with ELLs include but are not limited to:      2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             63      •     Whole language approach: Language is used in natural ways for a specific purpose in an activity that fosters social  interactions.  Instruction closely integrates speaking, listening, reading and writing.  •     Cooperative learning activities:  Scholars work together in small groups on a time limited task.  Scholars negotiate and  exchange knowledge and experiences while making connections with content and language.  •     Cognitive Academic Language Learning Approach (CALLA)  •     Total Physical Response (TPR)  •     Scaffolding  •     Visuals  •     Graphic organizers  •     Collaborative learning  •     Modeling  •     Read alouds  •     Pair share   •     Independent reading/writing in journals  •     Skills and guided practice     In order to challenge students to use higher order thinking skills, there are many open-ended questioning techniques,  accountable-talk, and non-fiction reading and writing.  Implementing such practices allows for the development of both basic  and inter-personal communication skills (BICS) and cognitive academic language proficiency (CALP) in our ELLs.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?         The Spanish LAB gives initial information about a student’s literacy level in their home language of Spanish.       5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status       In order to differentiate instruction for ELLs, the South Bronx Academy for Applied Media has several programs in place  that          provide supplementary support for the different ELL subgroups:  •     Scholars with interrupted formal education (SIFE) and ELLs as identified as having special needs receive additional  instructional time before school in the Scholar Sunrise Program, as well as targeted instruction in their Strategic Reading Class  using the Wilson “Just Words” program.  •     Newcomers (ELLs who have been in US schools less than 3 years) receive intensive targeted instruction in the 4 modalities,  reading, writing, speaking and listening, in small group settings.  This targeted instruction insures that ELLs quickly achieve the  state-designated grade-level of English language proficiency.  In order to acclimate these scholars to US culture, they are also  invited to take part in the Multicultural Club, a Title-III funded program that teaches ELLs about the many different cultures  and customs typical of the US.   •     ELLs receiving service 4 to 6 years who are in danger of becoming long term ELLs receive appropriate RtI Tier 1  intervention and if necessary,  (for those ELLs who are not showing sufficient progress on the skills and/or competencies  measured), RtI Tier 2, intensive, targeted intervention.  •     Almost 25% of our ELLs are long-term ELLs  (ELLs who have completed 7 or more years of ENL instruction).  Our goal for  them is to attain English language proficiency by the end of the school year.  These ELLs have agility with social interactional  English while lacking the advanced linguistic knowledge and skills required by complex secondary coursework.  The English  language development program “English 3D” is used with this subgroup in order to maximize students’ verbal and written  engagement and is designed to ensure proficiency in academic vocabulary, speaking, listening and writing.  Instruction overall  is driven by the students’ NYSESLAT scores which indicate individual strengths and weaknesses according to the 4  aforementioned modalities.  To accomplish this, the ENL teacher uses NYSESLAT test prep curriculum throughout the year to   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             64      prepare these scholars for the NYSESLAT exam in the spring of 2016.  •     When ELLs reach Commanding levels of proficiency on the NYSESLAT, they continue to receive 90 minutes of integrated  ENL instruction. They also receive ENL mandated NYS testing modifications for these two additional years. These testing  accommodations include time extension, a separate location,  bilingual dictionaries and glossaries, simultaneous use of English  and alternative language state test editions, oral translation for lower-incidence languages, and written responses in the native  language. Individual support plans are also created in conjunction with content area teachers as needed to assist in ELA, Math  and other content areas.                6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   In addition to yearly IEP meetings, all teachers of ELL-SWDs including the ENL teacher, content area teachers,  other related  service providers and the guidance counselor frequently meet to discuss the progress and challenges that each ELL-SWD  scholar is experiencing and reflect on their IEP mandates to ensure the scholar is receiving all appropriate services, be it  bilingual instruction or ESL instruction.    Teachers of ELL-SWDs also use a variety of instructional strategies to facilitate access  to academic content area and accelerate English language development.  Among these strategies are:            •     Small group instruction         •     Modify and adapt grade level text         •     RTI tier 1 high quality instruction         •     SMART board use of Technology         •     Graphic organizers         •     Audio visual aids         •     Visual aids              7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  As almost 50% of our ELLs are also SWDs, the South Bronx Academy for Applied Media, uses curricular, instructional and  scheduling flexibility to enable them to achieve their IEP goals and at the same time attain English proficiency within the least  restrictive environment.  Some of these include, but are not limited to:         •     ENL classes that are grouped by proficiency to create small group instruction         •     SETSS – Indirect Services with General Education Teachers         •     ELL services – Push in ENL instrution in SETSS and stand-alone ENL         •     Grade level meetings that involve both General Education and Special Education          •     Regular collaboration between the ENL teacher and the IEP Team          •     Additional instructional time before school in the Scholar Sunrise Program, the Saturday Preparatory Academy and  the     Extended Day         •     Targeted instruction in decoding and reading comprehension skills in Strategic Reading Class using the Wilson “Just  Words” program             8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Targeted intervention programs have been implemented at the South Bronx Academy for Applied Media for ELLs in English  language development, Math and ELA.    Within these programs, use of the native language is encouraged for clarification and   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             65      the use of bilingual glossaries and dictionaries is encouraged.  These programs include the Saturday Academy, part of the  school’s instructional Title III Program, the Achieve 3,000 academic expansion program, the 6th, 7th and 8th grade  extended  instruction (part of the Middle School Quality Initiative), the Wilson “Just Words” program and the English language  development program “English 3D.” These programs are outlined below:     Saturday Academy      Purpose: Develop ELA and Math skills, as well as prepare scholars for the NYS Math and ELA exams.  Target population: Scholars, including ELLs, in grades 6 through 8 who scored less than 2 on the 2015 NYS ELA and Math  exams.

Language of instruction: English  Program duration: September 2015 through June 2016, 6 periods per week  Materials: Just Words Student Kit      English 3D Language Development Program.  Purpose: Maximize students’ verbal and written engagement and ensure proficiency in academic vocabulary, speaking,  listening and writing as well as prepare scholars for the NYSESLAT exam.  Language of Instruction:  English  Target population: Long-term ELLs in grades 6 through 8 who have been receiving ENL instruction 7 years or more.  Program duration: September 2015 through June 2016, 4 -6  periods per week  Materials: English 3D book and student workbook          9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      For the upcoming school year, since almost 50% of our ELLs are also SWDs, we would like our staff to be knowledgeable about  ESL-SWDs teaching strategies. As such, we will provide them opportunities to attend professional development focused on this  topic. Also, we are considering offering foreign language electives; French and/or Spanish as a second language and Spanish for  native Spanish speakers which would focus on reading and writing to support home language literacy.Paste response to  question here:      2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             66         10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   At this time, we are not planning to discontinue any programs or services for ELLs. We feel that our current programs benefit  our students, and will continue to re-evaluate their effectiveness on a year to year basis at the end of the school-year.             11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  •     After school activities include but are not limited to Dance, Band, Chorus, Flag Football, Basketball and Computers.  In  particular, ELLs are encouraged to take part in the Multicultural Club, a Title-III funded program that teaches ELLs about the  many different cultures and customs typical of the US.  •     The extended day through the Middle School Quality Initiative supports  all scholars, including ELLs.  •     The Middle School Arts Initiative allows scholars, including ELLs, to explore the connection between the arts and the  common core curriculum.         12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  •     The Wilson “Just Words” program, used to support ELLs in grades 6 through 8 who scored below 50 on their initial Fountas  and Pinnell reading records conducted in the Fall of 2015     •     The English 3D Language Development Program, used with long-term ELLs, to develop academic vocabulary in reading,  writing and speaking that is required for ELA, Social Studies and Science.        13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Home language support is provided in the ENL program. The ENL teacher sometimes uses Spanish, a dominant language  among ELLs, to clarify points and scholars are encouraged to use their home language for specific purposes, such as  clarification or questioning. ELLs are also provided with materials in their native language in the ENL classroom, and have  access to bilingual dictionaries and glossaries in the ENL classroom and content-area classrooms as well.        14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    The South Bronx Academy for Applied Media uses grade-leveled materials that are appropriate to our scholars' age and grade.  Within the integrated component of ENL, the ENL teacher collaborates with the content area teacher in choosing resources  that correspond to ELLs' ages and grade levels and once a week the ENL teacher meets in Grade Team Meetings with the  content area teachers from each grade to ensure that resources are appropriately chosen.  In addition, all teachers of ELL- SWDs including other related service providers and the guidance counselor, frequently collaborate and meet informally to  discuss the progress and challenges that each ELL-SWD scholar is experiencing and reflect on their IEP mandates to ensure the  scholar is receiving all appropriate services according to their cognitive needs. Teachers of ELL-SWDs then employ a variety of  instructional strategies that facilitate access to academic content area and accelerate English language development.        15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    •     The Wilson “Just Words” program, used to support ELLs in grades 6 through 8 who scored below 50 on their initial Fountas  and Pinnell reading records conducted in the Fall of 2015     •     The English 3D Language Development Program, used with long-term ELLs, to develop academic vocabulary in reading,  writing and speaking that is required for ELA, Social Studies and Science.        2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             67         16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).      The parent coordinator and the guidance counselor collaboratively work on activities and workshops that benefit newly  enrolled ELLs before the beginning of school.  These include:  •     Club Getaway Community Building Excursion,  June - a day trip for selected scholars and newly enrolled scholars, ELLs  among them, that employs physical challenges to encourage group participation and community spirit.     •     Middle School Orientation for 6th graders coming from elementary school in August, (includes newly enrolled ELLs)   •     New Parents Orientation in early September (part of the school's parental involvement Title III Program), attended by  scholars, including newly enrolled ELLs.       ELLs that enroll throughout the year are invited to join the Multicultural Club that builds English-language literacy skills  through multicultural education.  In-school activities exploring the cultural heritage of the many ethnic groups in New York City  and focusing on the themes of race, immigration and cultural identity are complemented with instructional  trips to cultural  institutions in the wider  community.            17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    No language electives are offered to our scholars at the moment.        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.

Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  All teachers of ELLs will attend various professional development workshops offered by the Department of Education,  especially the Department of English Language Learners and Student Support, and other outside universities and educational  institutions that relate to supporting ELLs as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards.  As prescribed by CR Part  154.2,  attendance sign in sheets, agendas and certificates of attendance will be kept on file to monitor the 15% of total hours  that all teachers must receive regarding  ELL-specific professional development, and the 50% of total hours that the ENL  teacher must receive.  The ENL teacher will also informally provide support to all school staff in order to present relevant  material and strategies for use with ELLs.  Some of these issues will focus on, but are not limited to:  •     Literacy needs of our Entering ELL population  •     Scaffolding in the content areas.  •     Creating opportunities for ELLs to use a variety of modalities to learn (listening centers, visual representations, math  manipulatives, etc).     Teachers of ELLs will attend periodic professional development workshops offered by the Department of English Language  Learners and Student Support that focus on specific strategies and methodologies that facilitate engaging ELLs in the Common  Core Learning Standards.  They will also attend several professional development sessions facilitated by the ENL teacher,  among them     ENL Strategies and Common Core Learning Standards, How to Teach Academic Language to ELLs and ELL-SWDs  and the   2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             68         Writing Process.        2.

The guidance counselor and the ENL teacher will work together to assist ELLs as they transition from elementary to middle and  middle to high school.  In addition, the guidance counselor will also attend those professional development sessions facilitated  by the ENL teacher that are pertinent to guiding ELLs through this process.      As part of the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the South Bronx Academy for Applied Media, an ENL  consultant will periodically provide workshops that relate to strategies and techniques in teaching ELLs.  Additionally, the ENL  teacher will attend monthly professional development workshops offered by the Department of English Language Learners  and Student Support and assistance from the ENL teacher will provide support to the staff as they assist ELLs in their transition  from elementary to middle school and middle to high school. The ENL teacher will also facilitate several professional  development sessions for teachers of ELLs and related service providers, as outlined below:     TOPIC                                                                                       EXPECTED DATE       TARGET AUDIENCE  ENL Strategies and Common Core Learning Standards     January 2016          Classroom teachers and                                                                                                                                         related service providers                               How to Teach Academic Language to ELLs                      February 2016           Classroom teachers and                                                                                                                                                     related service providers   ELL-SWDs  and the Writing Process                                     March 2016            Principal, classroom teachers,                                                                                                                                           and related service providers        As prescribed by CR Part 154.2,  attendance sign in sheets, agendas and certificates of attendance will be kept on file to  monitor the 15% of total hours that all teachers must receive regarding  ELL-specific professional development, and the 50% of  total hours that the ENL teacher must receive.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Roshone Ault Lee, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             71                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:                                                                                   School DBN:     Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Students provide blue Emergency Contact Cards upon initial enrollment in school which indicate the language  preference of their parents/guardians and additionally, through the ATS RAPL and RHLA reports, the adult  preferred languages that are written and spoken at home are generated. Each year our parent coordinator also  asks for any additional requests for translation services. If we have students who are new to the NYC DOE, we  have the parents/guardians fill out the Home Language Identification Survey at the time of registration.         2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community.

Based on the needs expressed in the blue Emergency Contact cards, the parent survey, the ATS RAPL and RHLA  reports and the Home Language Survey, families will receive, via standard mail, translated copies of the Parents' Bill of  Rights and the Parents' Guide to Language Access. Information in those languages will also be posted in the Main  Office. A Language ID Guide will also be prominantly displayed in the main office for reference by staff and  administration alike.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       The Parent Coordinator together with the Language Access Coordinator will interface with the PTA throughout the  year to continuously monitor the translation and interpretation services at the school. The administration will also  conduct a survey at the end of each academic school year to gather feedback from parents regarding the quality and  availability of services.        2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             76
