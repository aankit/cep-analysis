This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Section 4: CEP Overview            Mission:    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      The staff of Public School 63/ Authors’ Academy is committed to providing all our students with a first class education.  Our staff provides an exemplar instructional program by providing an optimum learning environment for all students  by making a commitment to small group instruction where the instructional teams design research based high quality  differentiated instruction for all our learners and targeted differentiation intervention for our at risk students. In  addition to our academics, we cherish our diversity and strive to nurture tolerance, self-respect, and respect for  others. We embrace the support of our larger school community in an effort to build a solid partnership and also to  enrich educational experiences for each of us.             2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   PS 63 is an Elementary school in the Morrisania section of the South Bronx that serves 589 students in grades Pre-K-5.  The school population comprises 37% Black, 58% Hispanic, and 2% White students. The student body includes 21%  English language learners and 18% special education students. Boys account for 49% of the students enrolled and girls  account for 51%. The average attendance rate for the school year 2016-17 was 90%. With the on-going support of our  parents, dedicated staff members and CBO’s and a strong instructional leadership team we have been able to  successfully maintain the status of schools in good standing during the last 10 years.   Supportive Environment and Collaborative Teachers   PS 63 partners with CBO-Building Young Professionals who provide families with an after school program. They offer a  variety of services for students including homework support, arts enrichment, and physical education.      A full time school based funded arts teacher provides students in all grades with art instruction that is integrated into  the literacy units of study. Additionally, students in fifth grade, visit the Time in for Kids Art Studio once each week  where they are exposed to the art discipline by professional artists. Kids learn whole operas through hands-on art, go  on gallery hops and museum visits to the most important contemporary art shows all over the city, participate in  fantastic literacy and live performance activities.      Studio in a School Early Childhood PK Program is a once a week ,Blueprint based lessons that progress from materials- based explorations to more complex activities as the children gain experience and confidence.       Carnegie Math coaches provided teachers in grades second, fourth, and fifth in-person support. Professional Learning  Coaches delivered practical strategies, first-hand insights, and training that helped teachers shift their mindset,  deepen content knowledge, and create student-centered learning environments where everyone thrives.      Early Reading Matters (Kindergarten to 3rd Grade)   This partnership is dedicated to increasing teacher effectiveness, one of the most critical factors in student success.  The services transform how educators work together at urban public schools, helping the most effective teachers   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      develop the skills they need to lead their peers and drive school-wide improvement. They partner with school  leadership to create a work environment that equips teachers to succeed in the classroom.      During the 2017-18 school year, PS63 implemented The Five Practices for Orchestrating Productive Mathematics  Discussions, providing our students with opportunities to make their thinking visible. Teachers met with in-house  mathematics coach and Carnegie math coach to review data trends, conduct student inquiry, plan, and receive  feedback.          3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   PS 63 - Authors' Academy serves 591 students of which:     22 % are English New Learners (New to the country and/or with limited English proficiency)    20 % Special Education (With Academic and/or Behavioral Deficits)    19% in Temporary Housing          4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Principal Performance Observation Feedback 2017-18  Areas of Celebration:   2.2 Well Developed   Assessments are embedded into every unit. There are data sheets by class and for individual students that support  teachers’ ability to track student performance. Coaches support the collection of data and facilitate teachers’ use of  the data. Goals for student progress are set in the fall. Both teachers and students set goals that are tracked by the  teacher, administration and the students themselves. Pushables and slippables have been identified and provided  targeted support.       4.1 Well Developed    There are seven new teachers at PS 63. New Teacher Center trained mentors and coaches support the new teachers.  Professional development cycles are structured to support teachers at all levels. For example, Carnegie was brought  on to support teachers with a deeper understanding of math that will allow teachers to deepen students' conceptual  understanding. Teachers are also matched to provide targeted peer support.       Next Steps:   There is the beginning of the use of the strategies around the 5 Practices for Orchestrating Productive Mathematics  Discussions. Students are explaining and making their thinking visible. Teachers are becoming facilitators and allowing  students to explore their thinking therefore deepening their conceptual understanding.  New York State Assessment Performance Data:    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         Closing the Achievement Gap:   Our instructional priority for the 2017-18 school year was to improve teacher pedagogy around student-centered  learning in writing across content areas, resulting in the increased capacity of students to take responsibility for their  own learning, foster metacognition, critical thinking skills, perseverance, and self-reflection.   Our current performance data revealed that students across all grade levels struggle in making inferences grounded in  text evidence. Our NYS ELA scores and Fountas & Pinnell Running Record Data reveal that kindergarten through fifth  grade students struggle in thinking beyond the text and about the text. In light of the assessment pattern that has  been revealed through data collection, we have taken the following measures to rectify this trend:   During the 2017-18 school year, we continued to use the Framework for Great Schools as pillars to ensure that our  students make progress in expanding their level of comprehension beyond the literal and making connections beyond  the text. We worked towards remediating this trend by continuing to engage our students in rigorous instruction. We  provided our teacher teams with high-leverage professional development through Collaborative Teacher Teams to  enhance pedagogy. Our partnership with Teaching Matters provided teachers with targeted support in effectively  planning and executing the components of the reading block with an emphasis on Guided Literacy and Interactive  Read Alouds, frequently assessing students, and engaging in collaborative inquiry.     In reviewing the 2017-18 NYS Math assessment, performance based assessments, and state achievement standards,  we noticed that our students demonstrated success with conceptual understanding. However, they struggled with  comprehension of problems and devising a clear solution, when presented with multi-step tasks. As a result, during  the 2017-18 school year, we implemented The Five Practices for Orchestrating Productive Mathematics Discussions,  providing our students with opportunities to make their thinking visible by engaging in inquiry based learning.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 09X063   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   589   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  Each spring, we convene our Authors’ Academy Hiring Committee. We carefully review all of the resumes that we  maintain and the credentials of Open Market transfer candidates. Top candidates are invited for an interview with our  committee. At the interview, teachers present the portfolios which are filled with artifacts that speak to who each  individual is as an educator. We then ask a series of questions which are crafted by the committee. These questions  are consistently used for all candidates and address teacher qualifications and capabilities in the following areas:  lesson planning and instructional practices, data driven instruction, collaboration with parents/guardians and  colleagues, teaching philosophy and knowledge of our school community, conflict resolution strategies, and  professional contributions.   Hiring Committee members, depending on the candidates’ responses, decide who are invited back to level two of the  interview process which is often a demonstration a lesson. After the demo lesson followed by a debriefing session, all  the members of the committee must agree that the teacher will add value to the work we are currently immersed in.  The next level is the hired teacher meets with the academic coaches to study the curriculum maps for their  grade/program and content expectations         2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development   Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals,  paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).   Our teachers participate in rigorous, reflective and differentiated professional development which include ample  opportunities for teacher leadership and development. Teachers also receive feedback on their practice from peers ,  coaches and administration. For the past two years we have been selected by the Superintendent to host a series of  literacy workshops on small group instruction with a focus on guided reading . These workshops were used to support  both veteran and new teachers. For the inter-visitations, so that the participants could experience the actual practice,  we also included new teachers to showcase the work they had been doing with the coaches and administrators.    We also support new and returning teachers in a variety of ways such as matching new teachers with lead teachers as  a mentor. Partners meet for weekly meetings that support best practices. New teachers also are mentored by  coaches and administration. Our teachers also take advantage of learning from their peers, conducting inter -  visitations over the course of the year to observe best practices. All of our teachers participate in collaborative  learning lab -sites and one-to-one coaching with the academic coaches.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45      effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS 63X, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       PS 63/Authors’ Academy will support parents and families of Title I students by:   Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47      ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;               Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of th   school’s Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of  the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the  parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and  inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents  each month and file a report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48      ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, School Quality  Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:   Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;   ● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

These English Language Learners are at the Transitioning and  Expanding proficiency levels. The instructional program that will be used is, Trait Crate Plus by  Scholastic. The program uses fiction and non-fiction mentored texts to instruct students in  brainstorming ideas, organization, voice, word, choice, sentence fluency, and conventions. The  program will incorporate a balance of guided reading and guided writing activities throughout its  duration. Additionally, the instructor will build on prior knowledge, scaffold, and differentiate  instruction when necessary.     Program 2: Reading Comprehension for English Language Learners  Mr. Canarte, the ENL Instructor, provides ENL instruction by utilizing the Push-In/Pull-Out  model throughout the school day. The ENL instructor will coordinate with the content teacher to  parallel teach curriculum concepts that need to be reinforced through small group instruction  while implementing ENL methodologies for P.S 063’s after school program. The ENL instructor  will use flexible groupings to target ENL students who are at risk, and students who would  benefit from additional ENL service beyond classroom hours. The ENL instructor will enhance  the reading and math curriculum by teaching our ENL population specific reading and math  skills using mentor texts, which are books designed to meet a variety of curriculum needs from  reading fluency, vocabulary and phonemic development, reading comprehension, and decoding.  The primary focus of the after-school program is to accelerate language acquisition by  developing academic language through the content areas of ELA and Mathematics.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information   Program 3:  Saturday ELA Test Preparation for English Language Learners  4th grade Transitioning/Expanding ELLs  14.2% = 1 on ELA  21.4% = 2 on ELA    5th grade Transitioning/Expanding ELLs  29.1% = 1 on ELA  37.5 = 2 on ELA  English Language Learners, participate in Saturday ELA test preparation.

The first workshop, “Developing Language and Literacy at Home”  will target our Kindergarten ELLs.  We found that Kindergarten students who were administered  the NYSITELL and or Spanish LAB have scored low in the speaking modality.  We want to  address this need by informing parents of activities and strategies they can use at home to  increase oral language development and fluency of their child. Additionally, parents will be  educated on the importance of language and literacy  exposure at home and how it connects to  their academic growth. The second workshop will be “Enhancing Language with  Technology”.  We want to inform ELL parents of more meaningful ways to use technology at  home to support their child academically.  Our focus will be on sharing educational websites and  applications that target language development.  We will help parents navigate these websites and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         Part D: Parental Engagement Activities    applications, so they can help their child use them.  The third workshop is, “Supporting English  Language Learners Beyond Elementary school”. This workshop will be facilitated as parents  begin to complete middle school applications. We will provide parents with useful information  about the transition from elementary school to middle school for their English Language  Learners.  We want parents to understand the middle school transition process and understand  the resources and supports available to them as English Language Learners.  Parents will be  better informed to ensure a successful middle school experience for their child. Parents will be  invited to attend via school flier, as noted on the school calendar, and through a phone message.  Records of the meeting will be maintained by the facilitators.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Upon admission, the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) and informal interview are administered to determine a  students' eligibility for the New York State Identification Test for English Language Learners (NYSITELL).  Additionally, the  students' literacy skills are assessed using the Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment System. The reading assessment  evaluates student reading behaviors, fluency, and comprehension for independent and instructional reading levels. Spanish  speaking students are assessed using  El Sol and Evaluacion del Desarollo de la Lectura  (EDL).  El Sol assesses the literacy  development of newcomers including alphabet, sight-word recognition, reading comprehension, writing mechanics,  listening and speaking abilities, and phonemic awareness in Spanish. Evaluacion del Desarollo de la Lectura (EDL) identifies the  students' skills in reading engagement, oral reading fluency, and comprehension. The Math assessment used is an end of year  assessment from the child's previous grade.  Furthermore, i-Ready Diagnostic assessments are used throughout the school   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62      year to identify students' reading and math sub-skill levels. The ongoing monitoring shows where students are in achieving  end-of-year targets. The data collected in these assessments provides us with valuable information that is shared with the  students' classroom and ENL teacher.     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Assessments are administered during the admission process and throughout the school year as ENL students are  admitted.  Two ENL teachers are available to administer the New York State Identification Test for English Language Learners  (NYSITELL), Spanish-LAB, Fountas & Pinnell Benchmark Assessment and Evaluacion del Desarollo de la Lectura (EDL). The  classroom teachers administer the assessments throughout the school year. ENL personnel provide translation and  interpretation services, when needed.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The following assessments are used to monitor student understanding of content: NYC Benchmark Assessments (Fall and  Spring), In-house generated performance tasks, Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment System,  I-Ready Reading/Math  assessments, In house generated assessments, MOSL, and NYSESLAT.  These assessments are used to gather data for all of our  students, including English Language Learners and Special Education students.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    There is careful analysis of formative and summative assessments, which include the New York State English as a Second  Language Achievement Test (NYSESLAT), NYS ELA test, Fountas and Pinnell Running Records, MOSL assessments, PBA's, end of  unit assessments, NYS Math test, NYC Periodic Assessments, and performance based assessments. In addition, referrals from  the classroom and ENL teacher are reviewed to determine if an Academic Intervention Service is needed. The classroom  teacher, Enrichment Specialist, or ENL teacher may utilize a Guided Reading program, One on one conferencing, Word Work,  Interactive Reading and Writing, Shared Reading, Phonemic/Phonics, Decoding, Fluency, or Vocabulary work. If there is  minimal progress made at this time, additional support services will be provided in the morning program or after school  program by an ENL teacher. The Wilson Reading program will be used for ENL students in the upper grades and Fundations will  be used for the lower grades.      5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Student assessments such as; New York State ELA test, Fountas and Pinnell Running Records, MOSL assessments, end of unit  assessments, New York State Math test, NYSESLAT proficiency levels, performance based assessments, work samples, and  teacher reports for students who are not meeting ELA and Math instructional benchmarks are carefully reviewed. For ELA,  students will receive direct instruction by the classroom teacher, ENL teacher, and Enrichment Specialist in the form of Guided  Reading, One-on-One conferencing, Word Work, Interactive Reading and Writing, Shared Reading, Phonemic/Phonics,  Decoding, Fluency, Vocabulary work, i-Ready adaptive technology, or Imagine Learning English. For Math RTI, direct instruction  will also be provided by the classroom teacher, academic intervention teacher, and ENL teacher. They will use strategy lessons,  One-on-One Conferencing, and i-Ready adaptive technology.  Additionally, Speaking, Listening, Reading, and Writing  modalities are within the interventions for both content areas. Fundations and the Fountas and Pinnell Leveled Literacy  Intervention program are also used as interventions for our English language Learners. Fundations helps our ENL students with  sequenced skills, (phonological awareness, decoding, vocabulary) speaking, and listening skills throughout the lessons.  The  Leveled Literacy Intervention (LLI) focuses on accuracy, fluency, and comprehension in a small group setting.  LLI also targets  student writing.  This has been an area many of our ELLs of varying proficiency levels struggle with. The 2017 NYSESLAT results,  show that 17% of our English Language Learners in K-5 scored low in the writing modality. A portion of the Stand-alone  instructional time for Emerging and Transitioning students will be dedicated to guided writing instruction.  The focus is on  specific writing skills needed by each student, in order to expand comprehension of specific text read in the classroom. Under  the RTI model, after approximately 6 weeks of strong Tier 1 instruction and a second Fountas and Pinnell Running Record  Assessment, the RTI coordinator along with the teachers will use the data to determine which students are making adequate  progress and which students are candidates for Tier 2 intervention. After 6 weeks, if those students in Tier 2 are making  adequate progress, a decision is made either to continue them in Tier 2 intervention, or remove them from Tier 2 services. If   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63         progress is not happening, the RTI Teacher will change the research based program being used and/or intensify the RTI  instruction to Tier 3. For our ENL students, factors such as the student’s years of service in the ENL program, English and home  language literacy, and testing data, are factored in when determining appropriate next steps. Specifically, academic  intervention Math support will be given to tier 3 students through small group instruction by the math support teacher and  math coach. If Tier 3 instruction is unsuccessful, and all other measures exhausted (changing of program, hours of intensive  instruction), we will determine with the parents and school implementation team whether an evaluation for special education  services may be warranted.           6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   NYSESLAT, ELA, and Math data are used to evaluate and inform our ELL program. Pearson envision 2.0 End of Unit Math Test  will also be used to assess progress and student understanding of content. Additionally, NYC benchmark assessments (Fall and  Spring), in-house generated performance tasks, and I-Ready assessments are all data sources used to inform the curriculum  mapping for our ELL program. The data generated from the EDAT (ELL Data Analysis Tool) is used to filter specific subgroups of  our ELL population who are at risk of being long-term ELLs and in need of RTI intervention services. For example, 12.8% of our  ELL population are at risk in level 5 or greater. Furthermore, the numbers of ELLs in years of service five or six make up 10.4%  of our ELL population. The EDAT informs our ELL program by identifying specific subgroups of our ELL population who are at  risk of being long-term ELLs, which then allows us to design effective targeted instruction concentrating on the area in need  and focus toward the achievement of language proficiency.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?  The structures set in place to disseminate these findings is during Circular 6 (common teacher planning), grade-wide  conferences, weekly meetings with academic literacy coaches, and in-house professional development.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   Our students receive the required units of study according to their English Proficiciency Level.  We have self-contained  classes where teachers will provide the Stand-Alone ENL and the Integrated ENL to their classroom students.  If an  ENL student is not in a self-contained ENL classroom, the ENL teacher will push-in to the classroom to provide the  Intergrated ENL services alongside the classroom teacher.  The Stand-Alone ENL is provided through pull-out  services.  The teachers in the self contained ENL classrooms follow the Lucy Calkins Unit of Study curriculum for ELA  and the Pearson EnVision 2.0 for Math.  Students receive core content area and English language development  instruction in the comprehensive literacy curriculum as well as the Math curriculum where teachers will differentiate  using ENL strategies to support various proficiency levels.    b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      N/A      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?    Our Entering and Emerging ELLs receive 360 instructional minutes per week.  Transitioning and Expanding ELLs receive 180  minutes, while our Commanding (former) ELLs receive 90 instructional minutes per week.  Second and Third grade ELLs receive  the mandated instructional minutes via an ENL self-contained setting.  Stand-Alone ENL and Integrated ENL will depend on the  proficiency level of the student.  Entering students receive 1 unit of Stand-Alone ENL and 1 unit of Integrated  ENL/ELA.  Emerging students receive 1 unit of Integrated ENL and .5 unit of Stand-Alone or additional Integrated  ENL/ELA.  Transitioning students receive .5 of Integrated ENL/ELA and .5 of Stand-ALone ENL or additional Stand-Alone ENL.  Expanding students receive 1 unit of integrated ENL/ELA.  Students who are at the Commanding proficiency level receive .5 of  Integrated ENL in ELA or another Core Content area. We use Lucy Calkins Unit of Study Common Core aligned curriculum.  Self- contained ENL teachers and general education teachers use scaffolds within the curriculum to make content accessible to ELLs  of varying proficiencies.  The ENL provider aligns small group instruction based on the theme and content of the Lucy Calkins  Units.  This allows for the small group to revisit the content covered in the classroom.  The curriculum lends itself to help  students make connections and use prior knowledge to build content knowledge.  All of the ENL self-contained teachers hold  ESOL certification.  During the 2017 -2018 school year, an additional ENL teacher was hired to help provide our students with  ENL instructional minutes.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   P.S. 63 has a content based English as a New Language program.  Language instruction is embedded in English Language Arts,  Math, Science, and Social Studies using ENL instructional strategies, such as explicit vocabulary instruction, sentence starters,  graphic organizers, KWL charts, realia, manipulatives, word walls, and differentiation to provide entry points for various  proficiency levels. Students receive Integrated ENL and Stand-alone ENL instruction depending on the language proficiency  level of the student. Additionally, there is use of the home language as a support to enrich comprehension and make content  accessible. We continue to focus on academic language in the content areas as well as embed a language objective within  lessons to support language acquisition. Entering, Emerging, and transitioning students continue to receive stand-alone  language instruction. This provides the students with smaller group instruction and an opportunity to revisit content material  that is covered in the classroom.     4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   The program offered by P.S. 63 is English as a New Language. The Spanish-Lab, EL Sol, and Fountas &  Pinnell Benchmark Assessment/Evaluacion del Desarollo de la Lectura (EDL) are administered upon admission for newly  identified ENL students whose home language is Spanish to assess the proficiency in their L1.  Newcomer/Entering ELLs in  grades 3-5 are able to take the New York State Math State test in their native language, if it is available.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status     A. SIFE  In order to appropriately serve Students with Inconsistent/Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE), several assessment tools are  used that help provide instructional support needed when working with these students. These include the SIFE Oral Interview  Questionnaire and Guidance Document to collect information about a student's family and home background, educational  history, and literacy practices. The Multilingual Literacy SIFE Screener (MLS), also helps determine the literacy levels of SIFE in  the home language to design appropriate placement and instruction, and The Writing Screener, which identifies basic writing  skills. Additionally, a plan of action is decided upon to help the SIFE student work towards grade level standards. SIFE students   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65      will be supported through small group work via the Integrated/Stand-alone model. The focus with our SIFE students is to  introduce letters and sounds, so they may have a starting point in the classroom. The Imagine Learning software, assists in  providing SIFE students with the visuals and repetition they need when introduced to the new language, letters, and  sounds.  Every effort is made to have SIFE students attend morning program and Extended Day to receive additional support in  their learning.    B. Newcomer   Formal and informal assessments are used to evaluate Newcomer/Entering students. These assessments include the New  York State Identification Test (NYSITELL), Spanish-Lab, Fountas & Pinnell Benchmark Assessment, Evaluacion del Desarollo de la  Lectura (EDL), Math, and ELA baseline assessments. This program assesses the literacy development of newcomers, including  alphabet, sight word recognition, reading comprehension, writing mechanics, listening and speaking abilities, and phonemic  awareness in Spanish. Newcomer/Entering students receive 360  minutes per week of ENL instructional time.  This includes  Integrated and Stand-Alone instruction. During the Stand-alone time, an ENL teacher will work with Newcomer students in  small cooperative groups focusing on English language development in the Speaking, Listening, Reading, and Writing strands.  Small group instruction is aligned to the grade specific unit study in ELA and Math.       C. Developing  Our students in this subgroup, are beginning to show more independence in their academic language skills, but still require  content specific vocabulary instruction along with strategies they can use when working independently in reading and writing.  Reading strategies are used with this subgroup and include monitoring, self-correcting, re-reading to clarify meaning, problem- solving new words, retelling, and summarizing. Our students benefit from contextual and visual cues to aid in comprehension.  When working on writing, these students       D. Long Term  The 2017 NYSESLAT, revealed that two of our students are Long-Term ELLs and three additional students were identified at- risk.  Additionally, two of the five students are Special Education students. To prevent the at-risk students from becoming long- term ELLs and to support those that are Long-term Ells we look at student assessment data to identify gaps where  interventions are needed.  Our focus with this subgroup is mainly in the reading and writing modalities.  There is a focus on  academic language, because the students are struggling with language functions and sentence structure.  Another area of  focus with these students is grammar usage and mechanics to improve clarity and further enhance their writing.       E. Former  Our Former ELLs continue to receive ENL instruction for two additional years after testing Commanding on the NYSESLAT.  We  have found that our former ELLs, also require additional support in the writing modality.  For this reason, the focus when  working with Former ELLs is guided writing in the revision and editing stages of the writing process.     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   Teachers of ELL-SWDs use various strategies to scaffold academic content and vocabulary.  We have ELLs with IEPs that benefit  from the use of visuals embedded throughout the lesson, TPR, clear concrete language. The use of graphic organizers along  with oral directions that have a visual back-up are also used.  Students also benefit from personalized word walls, anchor  charts highlighting tiered vocabulary for the unit of study, and the use of manipulatives during instruction.  In addition,  students will work with partners and/or small groups during a lesson.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Currently, we do not have Special Education ELLs with Flexible scheduling.  We adhere to chapter 408 and all teachers and  service providers understand the IEP goals of the Special Education ELL students they work with.  In addition, collaborative  planning time is scheduled for teachers across grades K-5.  This planning time with the Literacy/Math coaches provides Special  Education teachers an opportunity to focus on curriculum planning with the needs of their students in mind.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66         8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.   For ELA, students will receive direct instruction by the classroom teacher, ENL teacher, and Enrichment Specialist in the form  of Guided Reading, One-on-One conferencing, Word Work, Interactive Reading and Writing, Shared Reading,  Phonemic/Phonics, Decoding, Fluency, Vocabulary work, i-Ready adaptive technology, or Imagine Learning English. For Math  RTI, direct instruction will also be provided by the classroom teacher, academic intervention teacher, and ENL teacher. They  will use strategy lessons, One-on-One Conferencing, and i-Ready adaptive technology.  Additionally, Speaking, Listening,  Reading, and Writing modalities are within the interventions for both content areas. Fundations and the Fountas and Pinnell  Leveled Literacy Intervention program are also used as interventions for our English language Learners. Fundations helps our  ENL students with sequenced skills, (phonological awareness, decoding, vocabulary) speaking, and listening skills throughout  the lessons.  The Leveled Literacy Intervention (LLI) focuses on accuracy, fluency, and comprehension in a small group  setting.  LLI also targets student writing.  This has been an area many of our ELLs of varying proficiency levels struggle with. The  2017 NYSESLAT results, show that 17% of our English Language Learners in K-5 scored low in the writing modality. A portion of  the Stand-alone instructional time for Emerging and Transitioning students will be dedicated to guided writing instruction.  The  focus is on specific writing skills needed by each student, in order to expand comprehension of specific text read in the  classroom. Under the RTI model, after approximately 6 weeks of strong Tier 1 instruction and a second Fountas and Pinnell  Running Record Assessment, the RTI coordinator along with the teachers will use the data to determine which students are  making adequate progress and which students are candidates for Tier 2 intervention. After 6 weeks, if those students in Tier 2  are making adequate progress, a decision is made either to continue them in Tier 2 intervention, or remove them from Tier 2  services. If progress is not happening, the RTI Teacher will change the research based program being used and/or intensify the  RTI instruction to Tier 3. For our ENL students, factors such as the student’s years of service in the ENL program, English and  home language literacy, and testing data, are factored in when determining appropriate next steps. Specifically, academic  intervention Math support will be given to tier 3 students through small group instruction by the math support teacher and  math coach. If Tier 3 instruction is unsuccessful, and all other measures exhausted (changing of program, hours of intensive  instruction), we will determine with the parents and school implementation team whether an evaluation for special education  services may be warranted.          9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      N/A     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?    Currently there are no programs or services to be discontinued. We find that our Freestanding English as a New Language  program in place is supporting instruction for our English Language Learners.      11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  English as a New Language students, are afforded equal access to all school programs.  Morning, After-school, and Saturday  programs are open to our English as a New Language students. ELLs are invited to attend a morning program designed to  address language proficiency stalls. The instruction will target the modality where students scored lowest on the 2018  NYSESLAT.       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Our English as a New Language program uses a variety of methods to address the needs of English Language Learners.  Students of all language proficiencies use visual aids, hands on tools, technology (i-Ready, EnVision 2.0 online tools) small math  groups, and modeling the thought process for students (think aloud).  Students have access to laptops and smart boards to aid  in reading, writing, and language development. Students also use the Imagine Learning English program throughout grades K-5  to support their language development. ENL students use this program for a minimum of 60 minutes per week. The placement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67         test in the Imagine Learning English program determines the starting point and focus for each student in vocabulary  instruction, oral language development, and reading comprehension. I-Ready (ELA) and EnVision 2.0 (Math) adaptive  technology give students additional opportunities to apply reading and math strategies they learn as they go through the  various reading passages and math problems. These programs allow for progress monitoring which supports the teacher in  planning for classroom instruction.       13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   We continue to see a high number of Spanish speakers throughout the grades. Our Spanish speakers are assessed when they  are admitted using the Spanish-LAB and Evaluacion del Desarollo de la Lectura (EDL). We continue to see an increase in the  number of Arabic students across the grades. We are able to provide some Spanish-English materials and some Arabic-English  materials for our students to use. This may be in the form of books, dictionaries, and/or visual aides.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.     The required services and resources used, are selected with student's needs in mind. Instructional materials purchased are  useful for various ages and proficiency levels.  For example, the Imagine Learning English software program adapts to the  student.  A Newcomer ELL is able to use the program and receive native language support if necessary. An Expanding ELL  benefits from reading comprehension activities that focus on inferencing and thinking beyond the text. School personnel  providing services to ENL students are informed of the student's language proficiency level and language history. The ENL  teachers maintain an open line of communication with classroom teachers and service providers to ensure that student needs  are addressed.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    N/A     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   We aim to provide a welcoming environment for our newly enrolled ELLs. Two Parent ENL Orientations  (September/November) are held for newly identified English Language Learners during the school year. Parents are also  invited to Curriculum Night in the beginning of the year and are provided with information and resources on ways to help their  children meet grade specific standards and Citywide Instructional Expectations.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    There are currently no language electives offered to students at our elementary school.        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68         Prior to the start of the 2018-2019 school year, NYSESLAT, NYS ELA and Math data are collected and analyzed to highlight  student achievement, identify areas of focus, and assess teaching practices to make informed decisions about  instruction. Instructional coaches will create a professional development calendar for all ELL personnel to include best  practices for ENL students. These workshops include, differentiated instruction for ELLs, research based strategies, use of ELL  resources such as the ELL Data Analysis Tool, academic language development in the classroom, using students background  knowledge to inform instruction, and meeting the needs of ELLs of all language proficiency levels in a classroom. In addition,  administrators conduct cycles of observation, instructional rounds or learning walks around the instructional goals, in order to  provide targeted feedback to improve or enhance teaching practices. All teachers of ELLS will be provided with in/out of school  professional development on ENL strategies to support ELLs in mastering the Common Core Learning Standards.       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Our teachers participate in rigorous, reflective and differentiated professional development which include ample opportunities  for teacher leadership and development. Teachers also receive feedback on their practice from peers , coaches and  administration.   All teachers are provided with the designated 15% of total hours of ELL professional development during the designated  Monday professional development time. This is facilitated by UFT Teacher Center Coach. One such workshop was, "Creating  Pathways for ELLs: Finding Ways to Challenge and Support our Students", which addressed NYS language proficiency levels,  research based strategies, stages of language acquisition, and creating a supportive environment for all ELLs. ENL teachers  meet the 50% of total hours through attendance at District 9 Liaison monthly meetings, annual NYSABE conference, and  NYC DOE AIS Professional Services K-5 workshops attended to support ENL students eligible for RTI. Administrators will  conduct cycles of observation, instructional rounds or learning walks around the instructional goals, in order to provide  targeted feedback to all teachers working with ENL students to improve or enhance teaching practices. Our instructional goals  continue to focus on  providing multiple access points to support student engagement in rigorous tasks, so that all learners,  including English language learners (ELLs), have opportunities to be highly engaged and to demonstrate critical and analytical  thinking.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Parents are invited to curriculum night in the beginning of the year to discuss academic goals, and provide them with ways  parents can help their children meet the rigorous demands of the curriculum, grade-specific standards, and Citywide  Instructional Expectations. Parent orientations are held on an individual basis for parents of newly identified ELLs to introduce  and discuss the ENL program model. During these parent orientation meetings, parents are provided with information on the  various language programs available to them in NYC. We discuss  our ENL program currently in place. Quarterly meetings are  then arranged during parent-teacher conference days with parents of ELLs to discuss language development progress and  language proficiency assessment results. Parents are also informed of the Tuesday meeting time to discuss their child's  language development and whether they are meeting classroom expectations. Teachers maintain an open line of  communication with parents of ELLs throughout the year.  Parents are welcomed to reach out to their child's teacher at any  point in time by phone, note, or email.  Translation/Interpretation is provided for parent's preferred language. Records of  parent meetings and phone calls are kept via a sign-in sheet or written log.  Copies of parent letters and sign-in sheets are filed  by the ENL teacher.      2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Reinaldo Diaz-lens, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   P.S. 63 Authors' Academy                                                                              School DBN: 09X063  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication.

These languages include Arabic, Bambara, French, Fulani, Italian, Mandinka,  Mossi, Soninke, and Spanish. We use various surveys and school reports to gather information about parents'  written and oral language preferences, in order to provide ample opportunities for our parent community to be  involved in their child's education. The Home Language Survey (HLIS) issued upon student registration informs us  of the language(s) spoken in the home and the parents' preferred language for written and oral communication.  The parents preferred language of written and oral communication is also entered on the Emergency Contact  Card during registration. Additionally, The Parent's Preferred Language Report (RCPL), Home Language Aggregate  Report (RHLA), RESI, RLAT, RFSF, RPOB, RADL, RMNR, and the Home Language School Data Summary (RSDS)  provide additional data helpful in identifying needs for communicating with parents.           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73     2.
