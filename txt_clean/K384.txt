This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Mission Statement:    Section 4: CEP Overview      The Frances E. Carter School, PS/IS 384, is a community school that affords all of our students the opportunity to  achieve academic excellence and personal growth through a rigorous, collaborative, safe and loving educational  environment. By providing students with strong academic foundational skills, and the knowledge that  perseverance leads to success, our students will develop into critical thinkers and conscientious decision makers.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      We will empower our students to make successful choices that will positively impact their lives in high school,  college, careers and beyond.      The Vision of PS/IS 384:    As a growth-mindset based community of learners, we instill in our staff, students and parents the belief that  everyone can get smarter, learn how to complete difficult tasks, solve complex problems and grow their own  intelligence. Our vision is to teach students how to use different strategies to overcome challenges, and understand  that hard work is the key to achievement. Having a growth mindset is essential to lifelong success, and at PS/IS 384  we prepare all of our students for the future by giving them the tools, knowledge, skills, and personal  characteristics needed to be successful.          2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    PS/IS 384 is a Pre K – 8 school that serves approximately 500 students in District 32, Bushwick , Brooklyn. It is  designated as "Meeting Target" as per the 2017 Framework for Great Schools Report. PS/IS 384 is funded as a Title I  school with a poverty level of 100% based on the school's designation as Universal Free Lunch.   We have a partnership with a Community Based Organization, which has supported the physical and emotional well- being of our students. Our partnership with New York Edge, formerly Sports and Arts in School Foundation (SASF),  provides a structured setting for after school supervision, with a focus on sports and arts. NY Edge offers many  opportunities for our students to explore various sports and artistic activities that they might not normally receive  during school hours.      There are a variety of enrichment programs in place for students so that they have the opportunity to be exposed to a  variety of activities; dance, kenjutsu, step, singing, guitar, community service and newspaper. We offer after-school  clubs on Friday afternoons for 2 hours and these clubs offer a myriad of activities for our students. We also have a  physical teacher that implements the CHAMPS Program, which enables our middle school students to play team  sports, such as volleyball and basketball.       A distinctive feature of PS/IS 384 is teacher pedagogy, which was designated as an Area of Celebration in the Quality  Review Report from 2017-2018. According to the last QR Report, PS/IS 384’s “Across most classrooms, teaching  practices are aligned to the curricula and reflect an articulated set of beliefs informed by the instructional shifts that  foster higher order thinking. Teaching strategies provide multiple entry points into the curricula. Teaching practices  reflect the belief that students learn best through collaborative groups leading to engagement in discussions. All  learners, including English Language Learners (ELLs) and students with disabilities, are engaged in appropriately  challenging tasks and demonstrate higher-order thinking skills.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   Currently, PS/IS 384 has approximately 126 students with IEPs and 140 English Language Learners. All students with  IEPs are provided services in 12:1:1, SETTS, ICT and/or related services such as speech, occupational therapy, physical  therapy, and/or counseling.    ENL services are provided as per CR-154's specifications by our three licensed ENL instructors. Additionally, all  students with IEPs are serviced in accordance with their IEP mandates. ELL students' varying English proficiency levels   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      determine their stand-alone and integrated service minutes per week. Students in the lower entering and emerging  proficiency levels are generally newcomers, who need more ENL instruction in all modalities, whereas long-term  English Language Learners with IEPs in higher grades need more focused instruction specifically in reading and writing.    In order to meet their varied English language acquisition and special learning needs, all students require intensive  reading and writing instruction, visuals, home language support, small group instruction, increased response time,  differentiated instruction and specially designed and differentiated instruction, modified curriculum, multi-modal  instruction in speaking, listening, reading and writing. These individualized requirements are essential and provided in  order to meet our ELL students and our students with disabilities' needs to ensure their continuing academic success.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Rigorous Instruction   Progress: According to the Framework for Great Schools, 90% of students agreed or strongly agreed that they are  learning a lot to in their classes at their school to prepare them for the next level or grade. In addition, this year,  Teacher's College Programs in both Reading and Writing was fully implemented in grades Kindergarten through Fifth.

Area of Focus: One area in which our schools hopes to show growth in the 2018-2019 school year is with student-to- student interactions. There are 39% of students say that students rarely or never harass, bully, or intimidate other  students at their school. Our school will continue to focus on social-emotional learning to target student bullying.      Effective School Leadership   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      Progress: According to the Framework for Great Schools 100% of teachers say that the principal makes clear to the  staff his or her expectations for meeting instructional goals.    Area of Focus: One area in which PS/IS 384 needs to focus is ensuring that our curriculum is well coordinated across  different grade levels. Only 74% of teachers say that curriculum, instruction, and learning materials are well  coordinated across different grade levels at their school.      Strong Family & Community Ties   Progress: According to the Framework for Great Schools 91% of families say that school staff regularly communicate  with them about how families can help their child learn.    Area of Focus: One area of focus for the 2018-2019 school year is to increase the amount of opportunities for parents  to come into the building to interact with the teachers and students, and to engage in various activities with their  children.       Trust   Progress: According to the Framework for Great Schools in the 2017-2018 100% of teachers say that it's OK to discuss  feelings, worries, and frustrations with the principal at their school. This is a huge increase from the previous year in  which only 64% of teachers that felt comfortable with discussing their feelings.       Area of Focus: One area that our school is working is increasing our teacher-student relationships. In 2017-2018  school year only 77% of students say that there is at least one adult in the school that they can confide in. We would  like to increase this to over 95%.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 32K384   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05,06,07,08   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   513   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     1. School's strengths in Rigorous Instruction:   According to the last QR Report, PS/IS 384’s “Across most classrooms, teaching practices are aligned to the curricula  and reflect an articulated set of beliefs informed by the instructional shifts that foster higher order thinking. Teaching  strategies provide multiple entry points into the curricula. Teaching practices reflect the belief that students learn  best through collaborative groups leading to engagement in discussions. All learners, including English Language  Learners (ELLs) and students with disabilities, are engaged in appropriately challenging tasks and demonstrate higher- order thinking skills."   2. Priority needs in Rigorous Instruction:    According to the data from the June 2018 Instructional Report, an area of focus for PS/IS 384 is the quality of  student’s constructed response on the ELA state exam. The combined average on the constructed response  questions, “Writing to Sources” for grades 3-5 is a .17 percentage points below the city average. The combined  average on the constructed response questions, “Writing to Sources” for grades 6-8 is a .03 percentage points  below the city average.            Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this  element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.      Goal:    During the 2018-2019 school year, PS/IS 384 will focus on writing, specifically on open-ended writing responses based  on writing from sources. By June 2019, it is the goal of PS/IS 384 to increase student proficiency on the “Writing from  Sources” section (constructed response questions) in the combined average of percentage points of grades 3 - 5, and  grades 6 - 8 by .05 percentage points, as compared to the city average, on the New York State ELA test.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14                  2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15   All teachers  (classroom teachers,  ENL teachers, SpEd  teachers, librarian,  clusters, etc.)      Administration:   ELA: AP -Ms. Cruz,  ULIT Coach Ms.  Smyth      Math: AP - Mr.  Quinci     Part 3a – Action Plan   Curriculum   ELA:   All Grades   Sept 2018- June 2019                                   Continue to implement TC Readers & Writers Workshop   (K-5) and Code X (6-8) with a focus on increasing the  opportunities for student writing in response to  reading/sources.     Teachers will create daily opportunities for students to   engage in on-demand writing (i.e. Do Now’s, free-writes,  quick-writes, etc.)     Teachers will create on-demand writing assessments to   monitor student progress.     Teachers will ensure that students have a clear   understanding of the writing rubric and are aware of their  performance on that rubric.     Teachers will plan units/lessons that are based on student   data that specifically target writing standards   Math:     Continue to implement Go Math!

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  Supportive Environment    Progress:    One noteworthy feature of PS/IS 384 is that we rank above both city and district averages for safety. According to  the Framework for Great Schools 93% of students say that they feel safe in their classes and 100% of PreK-5  teachers say that students are safe in the hallways, bathrooms, locker rooms, and cafeteria of their school. 93% of  our middle school student say that our school provides guidance for the high school application process, which is  above the city and district averages.     Area of Focus: One area in which our schools hopes to show growth in the 2018-2019 school year is with postive  student-to-student interactions. There are 39% of students in our school that say students rarely or never harass,  bully, or intimidate other students at their school. In the "Preventing Bullying" section of the Framework for Great  Schools Quality Survey PS/IS 384 scores 12% below the district average in this category. Our school will continue to  focus on social-emotional learning programs such as Ruler and using growth mindset to help increase positive  student behaviors and decrease student bullying. In addition, according to the Framework for Great School Quality  Survey only 71% of teachers say that adults at their school teach students how to advocate for themselves, this is  10% points below the city average. It is evident that our teachers must teach our children how to be self-advocates.              Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the  identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant,  and Time-bound.  By June 2019, we will implement school-wide practices that focus on growth mindset pillars and anti-bullying  behaviors which will help establish a school culture where students feel safe and supported as measured by a 10%  increase in positive student response in the "preventing bullying" section of the 2019 Framework for Great Schools  Quality Survey.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          19     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:   Target  Group(s)  Who will be  targeted?

Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT)   Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support  including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified.  ● Recruitment is accomplished by recommendation and word – of – mouth. The resumes are reviewed by  Administrators.. There is focus on the quality of professional education and training as well as previous teaching  experience and areas of demonstrated competence. Only candidates who are fully licensed will be qualified applicants  for any vacancy. Attention is also focused on finding a match for the culture of the school.    ● There is a thorough interview process. The candidate then prepares and conducts a lesson observed by the  administration. After the lesson, the administration meets to share their notes, observations, and impressions. If  necessary, the candidate is asked to prepare another lesson for observation.   ● The new teachers receive scheduled mentoring from a building based mentor teacher and support from the lead  teacher at their grade level. The Administration conducts brief focused observations of the new teacher and provides  targeted feedback using the Danielson Framework For Teaching Rubric.    ● Teachers receive assignments based on their content area expertise. Common Branch teachers are assigned to the  grades in which they have shown their familiarity and/or expertise. However, there are times when the teacher –  grade match is not optimal. In this case, much consideration is given to finding another grade placement. In most of  the instances where this was done, the teacher went on to flourish in the newly assigned grade.   ● If there are teachers who are not Highly Qualified in the area to which they have been assigned, the Administration  encourages and supports them in their efforts to satisfy the necessary requirements. The Administration maintains  diligence in updating these teachers about DOE sponsored initiatives in this area. Under this initiative, one teacher  satisfied the requirements for a Bilingual Extension while another obtained certification in ENL. Presently, there is one  teacher who continues to work toward fulfilling the requirements for designation as Highly Qualified in ENL.    ● All teachers are encouraged to participate in all DOE sponsored professional learning.    * Teacher recognition is held to high esteem. We hold several celebrations throughout the year to honor teachers'  dedication and hard work. Breakfasts and lunches are scheduled throughout the year.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36              2b.

Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).  ● There is a Universal Pre K program in-house.    ● Children are offered a seat in the Pre K Program after parents complete an on-line application.   ● Pre K teachers work under their Early Childhood License and have already taught in Kindergarten or Grade 1.  Therefore, they understand the elementary school curriculum.    ● Pre K teachers and their students participate in Cookshop which spirals into Kindergarten, Grades 1, 2, & 3.   ● Pre-K students participate in Prep Period Specials such as Art, Music, and Library. This is a step toward integration  with the entire school community.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      ● The Pre-K teachers confer with the Kindergarten teachers to ensure transparency and vertical alignment of  curriculum.   ● Teachers in Pre K meet in a professional leaning community to evaluate student work and formulate a plan for  instruction that supports readiness for Kindergarten.   ● During the June clerical days, teachers in Pre K and K confer as the records are passed up.    ● In June Pre K students are supported in their transition to Kindergarten as follows:   ● Their teacher takes them on a walk throughout the school   ● There is an initial introduction to the cafeteria as the place for breakfast and lunch   ● They visit the Kindergarten classrooms   ● On one of the final days in June, they follow the Kindergarten schedule for the entire school day, which means they  experience an entire school day without naps or center time play.   ● There are on-going parent workshops to prepare parent/guardians for their child’s transition to Kindergarten and  the implications of that transition.        4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.        The following committees demonstrate that teachers participate in the decision making process:   ● MOSL Selection Committee is composed of teachers and administrators. This committee will analyze the 2016-2017  MOSL data and will select the MOSLs for the 2017-2018 school year.   ● Mentoring Committee is composed of teachers and administrators. This committee monitors the integration of new  teachers into the life of the school and the process of mentoring for new teachers.    ● The Assessment Plan for 2017-18 will be updated with input from the staff.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39        Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS/IS 384 , in compliance with the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) Act, is  responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of  student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed  by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children.

The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● Actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● Engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● Ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● Support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association.)

Careful analysis of this together with the NYSESLAT, MOSL, ELA and Math  exams  demonstrated that ELL students in grades K-8 require additional support in literacy,  particularly in the areas of  reading comprehension and writing.  A need was also determined in  the area of Math.  Also, the Professional Collaborative Teams on each grade level have utilized  several rubrics, including Teacher's College, Six Traits of Writing and teacher created rubrics for  informal evaluation of student writing.  Analysis indicated that ELL students require additional  support in their efforts to write at levels that reflect the Common Core Learning Standards. This  program would be helpful in attaining our school wide goal for compliance with the citywide  initiatives of accomplishing Common Core Performance Tasks in each subject area.   As a result, Title III After School programs were designed to support students as they aspire to  improve their skills in these areas.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?       PS/IS 384 uses NYSITELL in grades K-8,  NYSESLAT in grades K-8, Measures of Student Learning in grades K-8, Pearson  Periodic Assessment for ELLs  in grades 3-8, New York State Standardized Assessments in grades 3-8, Fountas and Pinnell  in  grades K-8, as well as individual classroom-based assessments.  All assessments discussed in the RTI section are also  utilized.  In addition to identifying the young students’ needs, information obtained from some of these assessments has  enabled staff to identify older students’ early literacy needs, which often occur when a student is SIFE or has entered an  English-speaking school in later years and requires age-appropriate early literacy materials.  Upon obtaining this information  from data analyzed in various reports, our school has increased the number of early-literacy reading material that is age  appropriate for older students, as well as younger ones.           Additionally, for students who are not newcomers, the data indicates that most English Language Learners do not usually   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      achieve English proficiency as determined by their NYSESLAT results due to their Writing scores.  As a result of this conclusion,  there is a special concentration on the ELLs in the work of the Inquiry Teams.  Also, our third school goal for the 2017-2018  school year strives to move all students to an advanced proficiency level in writing across the content areas.           Also, NYSITELL scores are administered only once in the lifetime of a student to assess their initial English proficiency.  Most  students, regardless of age level, score at the Entering or Emerging level at this time.          Many of the conclusions drawn from the data obtained in this Language Allocation Policy had a degree of predictability.  As  most other research suggests, most students at PS/IS 384 achieved Listening proficiency first, following by Speaking, then and  Reading and Writing respectively.  Also, this research is in line with nationwide research in which Writing is the most difficult  modality. Another predictable conclusion that our data supports is that younger newcomers achieve proficiency in all  modalities sooner than students who enter an English speaking school at an older age.              Finally, many students with IEPs have cognitive limitations and/or speech and language disabilities which impede their  ability to attain a commanding score or advancing a proficiency level on the NYSESLAT,         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?        As a result of an increase in the percentage of ELLs in our school, and the updated EDAT report's detailed information  regarding our ELL students' risk levels, we have initiated a change in our Inquiry Team structure to address these  students.  Our school now has an all-ENL teacher Inquiry Team which meets on Tuesdays after Parent Engagement time.  This  Team is in contrast to previous year's Inquiry Teams in that participating teachers and targeted students are not limited by  grade level, as they were in the past.  At this time ELL student work throughout grades K-8 will be addressed.  All ENL teachers  will meet in this collaborative team to review data, discuss effective research-based ENL strategies and discuss  instructional plans to best address these students. Administration will periodically meet with the teams to ensure necessary  resources are available to advance the targeted ELL students' English language acquisition.  Finally, an additional alternative  was added to our Professional Period selections this year, in which teachers who share specific ELL students can articulate with  each other in order to further determine effective strategies, instructional planning and areas of need.  Finally, after analyzing  the updated EDAT report, it was determined that last year's Kindergarten and Fourth grade students had the highest incidence  of students scoring high in the Writing modality of the NYSESLAT.  Contributing teachers will be invited to share their  experiences and advice during our ELL Inquiry Team so that others may emulate their success.       3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Our school evaluates the success of the ELLs as follows:     1.  Student growth in the NYSESLAT performance     2.  Student growth in the New York State ELA and Math Assessments     3.  Student growth in other New York State Assessments.     4.  Student/Teacher conference notes     5.  Student performance on teacher-created assessments     6.  Student classroom work portfolios     7.  Student performance on assessments in technological instructional programs     8.  Measures of Student Learning     9.  Running Record        10  Destination Reading      11.  Reading Plus and other technology program learning assessments       12. Teacher observation of ELL students' self-esteem and cross-cultural understanding           13. Revised for 2017-2018 EDAT Tool           Although the 2017 administration of the NYSESLAT indicated improvement among our test takers, with 9.7% scoring  Commanding and 25.8% advancing one proficiency level, we have identified several areas of need among our English Language   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      Learners.   According to the most recent data, the greatest academic area of need among ELL students in our school continues  to be Writing, particularly in our middle school grades.  This was predictable as the 2016-2017 school year had a high incidence  of new admits who were first-time NYSESLAT takers.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Teachers collaborative teams meet every Tuesday to review data available on the updated ELL Data Analysis Tool.  Statistics  are discussed and reviewed.  If further research is required, it is noted and team members will follow through or ask  administration for assistance.  Interventions and instructional strategies to address noted areas of need are utilized as  needed and include:  ·         Use books on tape            Technology programs BrainPop ENL and BookFlix  ·         Provide books/study sheets with key phrases/words highlighted  ·         Allow use of tape recorders  ·         Use visuals to add meaning  ·         Allow students to highlight key points   ·         Use audible reading software  ·         Practice skills use Electronic devices(e.g. Leapfrog)  ·         Provide graphic organizers  ·         Use direct teacher and strategy instruction  ·         Use small group instruction  ·         Use paired reading and echo reading  ·         Use magnifying bars  ·         Use word frames  ·         Present new vocabulary visually  ·         Describe visual examples  ·         Use study aids/manipulatives  ·         Exempt from reading aloud before peers  ·         Use live reader (e.g. peer)  ·         Provide adaptive material (e.g. slant board, use of computer keyboard, etc.)  ·         Allow oral or a physical response  ·         Use a scribe  ·         Provide additional time to complete assignments  ·         Do not penalize for handwriting or spelling errors  ·         Use visual instructional  sentence strips  ·         Guided reading            Wilson            Foundations (K-2)             Go Math!

[Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]         At the beginning of the year, all students in grades K-8 are screened using a baseline writing assessment that is scored  according to the Six Traits of Writing Rubric that has been aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards.  Targeted writing  goals are then set, and measurement of attainment of these goals is monitored approximately every two months.  Writing is   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      also assessed and evaluated for the Common Core Performance Tasks.  This is done at the beginning, middle and end of the  task.            In grades K-3 relevant assessment data for ELLs is acquired by the Measures of Student Learning and Running Records for all  grades.          The results of these assessments are utilized to determine the appropriate Response to Intervention Planning tier for each  student.   In order to effectively assess the needs of English Language Learners, these assessment batteries include measures  of code-based skills, such as phonological processing and phonics skills, in addition to meaning-based skills such as listening  comprehension, vocabulary knowledge, and conceptual knowledge.           Additionally, progress is monitored by informal assessments for each modality; speaking, listening, reading and writing in  the ENL classroom.  Teachers are mindful of the need to analyze data through a language acquisition lens.  That is, they must  differentiate between what may or may not be difficult for a child because it is not familiar in their home language during  various curriculum-based measures, classroom observations and performance-based assessments.          Finally, regarding the use of data, for each English language learner who scores below specified levels of performance on  the annual English language proficiency assessment,  PS/IS 384 shall determine the additional support services to provide the  student, taking into consideration evidence such as the following:   • Number of years of instruction in a bilingual education or English as a new language program   • English and home language literacy   • Content area and socio-emotional support needs of students with inconsistent and/or interrupted formal education (SIFE)   • English and home language literacy needs of long-term ELLs   • Results on the annual English language proficiency assessment exam   • ENL teacher recommendation   • Content area teacher recommendation   • Parent or guardian request   • Sample of student work in English and, if possible, in the home language   • Bilingual educational evaluation, if the student has or is suspected of having a disability      The support services provided must be aligned to any intervention plans (e.g., Academic Intervention Services) we are already  providing to all students.           6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].           As mentioned above, most students at PS/IS 384 achieved speaking proficiency first, followed by listening, then read and  writing respectively.  Also, with the new NYSESLAT exam proficiency levels (B, I, A, P to EN, EM, TR, EX, CM), comparing the  2016 to the 2017 administration was less problematic this year in terms of determining growth.   Upon analyzing the updated EDAT report our ELL students' Math and ELA progress, growth was generally comparable with our  never-ELL populations, with the exception of first and sometimes second year test takers who are also newcomers in grades 3  and higher.  Also, as is the trend citywide, students who attain the Commanding level on the NYSESLAT generally outperform  their monolingual peers.           7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Collaborative learning communities target ELL students at which time detailed analysis is given to each grade regarding  proficiency levels in each modality.   Also, L2RPT letters which indicate precise modality scores for students are made available  to teachers and parents at our ELL Parent meeting.  Also, a detailed ELL Participating List is provided to teachers of ELLs to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57         inform them of their current proficiency level and other information.  Finally, the current EDAT report is available in the Data  Room.  Staff is designated to obtain any requested additional data, and information is utilized to inform instructional planning.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.                  There are eight ENL certified teachers in the school. Four of these teachers have a self-contained class (one  in first grade, one in second grade, one in fourth grade and one in fifth grade) comprised of students of varying  proficiency levels (heterogenous). The students are grouped together (block model) for the entire day for all content  instruction. The other two ENL certified teachers work collaboratively with five common branch and Special Education  licensed classroom teachers (of grades K, 3 and 6-8), for integrated ENL services in heterogenous classrooms to  provide the ELLs with their appropriate units of instruction in accordance with their English proficiency levels, and  standalone ENL instruction for students at the Entering and Emerging proficiency levels.  Students in the Entering and  Emerging proficiency levels, shall receive Stand-alone ENL instruction for four periods per week in order to obtain  basic English language instruction through the ELA content area.  These standalone sessions may consist of students  of two grade levels.  Students with IEPs may received standalone ENL instruction spanning three grade levels.  Upon  attaining a Commanding score on the NYSESLAT, students remain with the designated ELL classes in order to receive  two periods of integrated ENL instruction per week for the following two years.         b.  TBE program.  If applicable.            c.  DL program.  If applicable.      NA        2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?                       All students at PS/IS 384 receive ten periods (450 minutes) of ELA instruction per week regardless of ELL  designation.  Entering and Emerging ELL students receive a minimum of eight periods (360 minutes) of ENL instruction per  week, with 180 minutes of Stand-Alone ENL, while Transitioning and Expanding students receive four (180 minutes) of  integrated ENL/ELA service.  Finally, Commanding ELLs who passed the NYSESLAT within the last two years receive 90 minutes  of integrated ENL, in accordance with NYS CR Part 154. These out-of-classroom ENL teachers schedule their program to ensure  all periods are met as mandated. Current ELL students of all proficiency levels are provided twenty-five percent native  language usage and support as per CR Part 154.            3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.          Through the ENL Integrated and Standalone Programs, the ENL teachers meet with the classroom teachers during their  weekly articulation periods to discuss the week's content areas and plan their lessons based on Common Core Learning   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      Standards and NYS ENL and Performance Standards.  The teachers implement an instructional program that utilizes a balanced  approach to teaching and learning and is comprised of best teaching practices that enhance the language development of the  ELLs. Thus, the ELLs have the opportunity to excel academically and socially (Children First Initiative’s uniform curriculum) by  learning through the same, challenging and rigorous instructional program as their peers. The ELLs receive a comprehensive,  multi-sensory approach to learning to enhance the four modalities (listening, speaking, writing and reading) through hands-on  activities that include:       Use of realia and technology to explore and research topics.  Continuous interaction with peers in both classroom and social settings.  Use of accountable talk during discussions  Development and presentation of art, science and writing projects  Development of vocabulary and comprehension skills during Readers and Writers Workshops, as well as other content areas.  Discussions on the math, current events to develop higher order thinking skills.  Role-playing and language development through art, music and creative expression  Providing all ELLs with the same academic experiences as their peers  Providing ELLs with their appropriate units of instruction  Supporting the ELLs to achieve grade and state level standards  Enhancing their oral and written communication skills  Maximizing language acquisition for ELLs                   ENL instruction for all ELLs aligns Common Core and ESL Standards-based strategies within the school’s comprehensive core  curriculums in Mathematics (Go Math Math Program) and Literacy (Ready Gen, as well as Science, Social Studies (RIGOR -  Reading Instructional Goals for Older Readers),  Art and other content areas, to provide the ELLs with their appropriate units of  instruction (eight units per week for beginner and intermediate students and four units per week for the advanced).  Each  program is a scientifically research-based program.  An ELL's language, cultural background, interests and academic standing  are considered when differentiating instruction for them.  Differentiation of instruction for ELLs includes additional strategies  and materials incorporated into daily lessons through the use of visual aids, technology-based programs, small group  instruction and peer support.  The instructional resources used in the ENL Program include the following:     Reading Plus, BrainPop ESL and Bookflix Technology programs  "RIGOR - Reading Instructional Goals for Older Readers for grades 3-8  "Into English" series for grades 3-6  On Our Way to English" for grades K-3  Content area books  Anthologies  Theme-based literature and project activities  Listening Centers  AudioVisuals  Leveled Libraries  Puzzles and Games  Word Walls  Technology  Songs and Poems  Visual Aids (picture cards, charts, posters, picture dictionaries)  Translation Dictionaries  Books on Tape/Big Books  Native Language Resources, such as libraries, texts, technology and primary resource materials.            4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59                                   As a school with an ENL program only, students are not evaluated in their home languages.  In the event that a  student's home language is determined to be Spanish and his or her NYSITELL scores entitle them to ENL services, they are  administered the Spanish LAB-R in accordance with CR Part 154.  The results of this exam will determine their home language  proficiency, which will help teachers make informed decisions regarding their Spanish-speaking ELL students' instruction.  All  recommended test guidelines are followed and administered by a teacher with a bilingual extension.  Also, students identified  as ELLs are given translated testing materials in their native language as per state regulations.  Additionally, translating  dictionaries are provided for each ELL as provided by state regulations.          5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status                   SIFE students are also provided with the aforementioned services. However, additional support includes the  development of safety net programs through academic intervention services and pull-out programs to target and address their  specific needs     Newcomers  ELLs with 3 or less years in US schools are provided with intensive instructional support that includes: small group support,  hands-on activities to enhance vocabulary development, close monitoring through formal and informal assessments and  ongoing contact with parents. These students are also afforded the opportunity to participate in extra-curricular activities (e.g.  sports, dance, chorus, art, etc.).  This increases their interaction with peers and enhances their social and academic skills. ELLs  (that are new to the school) and their parents are invited to a tour of the school.  In addition, they meet with the  administration, teachers and students to learn of our school’s academic and social programs.  Our school has also  implemented peer tutoring, whereby former ELLs who share a common language with newcomers assisted them in  completing their core subject studies.     Plan for ELLs receiving service 4 to 6 years and Long Term ELLs                These students are monitored closely by the classroom and ENL teachers, administrators and the Inquiry  Team.  Formal and informal data is utilized to assess their strengths and needs. Through classroom instruction, academic  intervention services, Zero Hour, After School Programs, Title III Supplemental Programs and parental involvement these  students receive the necessary support to improve their academic standing.      Plan for Commanding ELLs in the two-year Monitoring phase               These students generally remain among their peers of Current, Transitioning and Former ELL students in order to  continue to receive mutual support.  This is especially true when the current and former ELLs share a common first language  with the Transitioning ELL.  After careful consideration, exceptions are made when it is determined that a Transitioning ELL  would benefit from being placed in a class of monolingual students.       Additionally, these students continue to be invited to participate in all Title III programs and activities.         6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?                  Students with disabilities whose IEPs mandate ENL instruction are provided access to the same programs, curriculum,  grade level materials and resources as students in the general education population. Formal and informal assessments coupled  with the students’ IEPs are consulted to align appropriate services and strategies to instruction on a case per case  basis.  Specifically, additional scaffolding and modelling is particularly essential to ELL students with disabilities' success in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60      English language acquisition.   This additional support is provided through small group instruction, academic intervention  services,  after-school and zero hour programs and is designed to meet their diverse needs.  Since all of our ELL students with  disabilities are Spanish-speakers, all paraprofessionals who service these students are bilingual to support their English  acquisition and listening comprehension.  Also, ELL students with disabilities receive ENL lessons emphasizing context-rich  instruction designed to enhance English language understanding and production in listening, speaking, reading and writing.         7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?                                  All required ELLs with IEPs' curriculum and instruction correspond to the ELL's age, language, English proficiency and  grade level.  These students are provided access to the same programs, curriculum, grade level materials and resources as  students in the general education population.  Formal and informal assessments coupled with the students' IEPs are consulted  to align appropriate services and strategies and instruction on a case per case basis.  Specifically, additional scaffolding and  modelling is particularly essential to ELL students with disabilities' success in English language acquisition.  This additional  support is provided through small group instruction, academic intervention services, after-school programs that are designed  to meet their diverse needs.  Since all of our ELL students with disabilities are Spanish-speakers, all paraprofessionals who  service these students are bilingual to support their English acquisition and listening comprehension.  Also, ELL students with  disabilities receive ENL lessons emphasizing context-rich instruction designed to enhance English language acquisition and  listening comprehension. Also, ELL students with disabilities receive ENL lessons emphasizing context-rich instruction designed  to enhance English language understanding and production in listening, speaking, reading and writing.                     Students with disabilities are provided integrated ENL services into heterogenous special education self-contained  classes to provide scheduling flexibility when needed to ensure their diverse needs are met in the least restrictive  environment, and standalone ENL instruction for students at the Entering and Emerging proficiency levels.  In order to meet a  student's iEP goals, any student whose IEP mandates bilingual instruction shall have an alternative placement paraprofessional  who speaks the student's home language obtained for the child.  The students are provided with ENL instruction as prior to  their pending placement in a bilingual special education setting in another school.                      Additionally,  all ELLs with IEPs are provided with all the Intervention Programs that are provided to English Language  Learners in the general population.         8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.      ENL instruction for all ELLs aligns Common Core and ENL Standards-based strategies within the school’s comprehensive core  curriculums in Mathematics (Go Math),  ReadyGen, as well as Science, Social Studies (RIGOR - Reading Instructional Goals for  Older Readers), Art and other content areas, to provide the ELLs with their appropriate units of instruction.  An ELL's language,  cultural background, interests and academic standing are considered when differentiating instruction for them.             Additionally, all ELLs are provided with the following Intervention Programs:  After School Program, Tuesdays and  Wednesdays, for 90 minutes each day after school.   Native Language support during these Intervention Programs is twenty- five percent as recommended.              Differentiation of instruction for ELLs includes additional strategies and materials incorporated into daily lessons through  the use of visual aids, technology based programs, small group instruction and peer support.        9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?           For the upcoming school year, our school is looking into several pilot technology programs.  Provided it is successful, we  shall continue it into the next school year.  Existing  technology programs for ELLs, such as Reading Plus, BrainPop ESL and  Bookflix, will continue to be available to all students.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?      We do not plan to discontinue any programs for our ELLs this year unless funds are not available.            11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.         At present, all ELLs are afforded equal opportunity to access all programs and measures are taken to ensure  communication regarding all programs are sent home in the parent's preferred language.  Additionally, all ELLs are provided  with the following Intervention Programs:  After School Program, Wednesdays and Fridays, for 90 minutes after school.  These  Intervention Programs are funded with Title III funds and Fair Student Funding.          Although the Title III program is focusing on New comers, we will also have all English Language Learners in the program,  including Long Term ELLs and SIFE students.  One teacher will service two grades in grades 2-8.  Each group consists of two  grades divided as 2-3, 4-5, 6-7 and 8th.  All will focus on ENL, ELA and Math.  It is the be held on Wednesdays and Fridays from  2:30 pm - 4:30 pm and will begin November 1, 2017 through May       Although the programs is focusing on Newcomers, we will also have all English Language Learners in the program, including  Long Term ELLs and SIFE students.

How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?          As per parent's preference, indicated on the "Parent's Choice" form, our school offers an TBE program in Kindergarten and  an ENL program for grades 1-8.  We provide 25% native language support in keeping with the recommended best practices for  native language support in ENL programs, and the appropriate home language support (between 20% and 80% in our TBE  program depending on the time of the school year.   This support includes dictionaries, textbooks, worksheets, various genres  in languages other than English, technology programs and classroom listening centers and are made available to ELL students  during intervention programs  Bilingual staff may also communicate with students in their home language to ensure student  understanding to provide the student with a variety of means by which to express his or her knowledge.            14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.                We provide levelled classroom libraries to include multi-cultural books appropriate to grade level and ages for  ELLs.  Literature is monitored to ensure age-appropriateness and corresponds with the appropriate current proficiency level  for each individual student.         15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?        PS/IS 384 is co-located with PS 53, which is a District 75 school.  The school building's structures, library, elevator, cafeteria  and gymnasium are shared by both schools., and a schedule is made to ensure adequate time for both.  Also, to ensure  students' socio-emotional needs are met, both schools share the school psychologist and social worker.  Occupational  therapists and physical therapists see students from both PS/IS 384 and PS 53.  Teachers are not shared between the schools.          16.

Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.              For students transitioning between elementary and jr. high school, the guidance counselor provides ELLs with a  transitioning session, in which students are acquainted with changing classrooms as needed throughout the day.  An activity is  conducted whereby students utilize a sample schedule to determine where and when to attend class.  Additionally, in fifth  grade students are partially de-compartmentalized to acclimate to middle school gradually.         A minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the required professional development hours for all teachers prescribed by CR Part 80  must be dedicated to language acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating  language and content instruction for English language learners. For all bilingual and English as a new language teachers, a  minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the required professional development hours must be dedicated to language acquisition in  alignment with core content area instruction, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating  language and content instruction for English language learners. The focus of professional development is to provide the  teachers with a comprehensive, multi-sensory approach to teaching that aspires to improve overall student achievement,  while adhering to the new CR Pt 154 requirements.  A file is maintained in the Title III Binder that contains a record of the  hours of training for each teacher. Teachers completing their required hours of training receive a certificate.

Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?        The Parent Coordinator plays a vital role in the engagement of parents.  The Parent Coordinator meets regularly with  parents to discuss their social and academic needs, in addition to the new annual Parents of ELLs meeting created this school  year.  These issues are shared with school personnel and are addressed through meetings and workshops during school.  The  Parent Coordinator assists as translator during Parent Orientation sessions, helping administer the Parent Choice and Parent  Survey and Program Selection Forms.  Additionally, the Parent Coordinator utilizes Parent Notification Letters to communicate  with parents in the event that they are not accessible by phone.   Additionally, L2RPT letters for students who have taken the  NYSESLAT the previous school year are printed and distributed to parents.            PS/IS 384 makes provisions to individually meet with the parents or guardians of English language learners at least once a  year, in addition to parent-teacher conferences, initial parent orientations, quarterly progress meetings or other scheduled  meetings provided for parents or guardians, to discuss the goals of the program, their child’s language development progress,  their child’s English language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas. This  additional meeting includes school staff who are necessary to sufficiently inform the parents or guardians about the child’s  language development in all content areas in English.  This meeting is conducted with a qualified interpreter/translator in the  language or mode of communication the parent or guardian best understands. We determine the manner and form of such  individual parent meetings, in accordance with collective bargaining agreements.   Attendance is recorded using existing  procedures.         In order to ensure parents of English Language Learners are informed of their child's progress, letters are sent home in their  preferred language, inviting parents to come visit their teachers on Tuesday afternoons during parent engagement time.  At  this time, L2RPT letters, with detailed information regarding student NYSESLAT proficiency levels in each module will be  discussed and clarified.  With this information, parents will be made aware of recent English acquisition growth and which  specific modalities need focus.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66         2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.        PS/IS 384 maintains a strong partnership with parents because they are the key ingredient to the success of the  students.  To support the parents (including parents of ELLs)  Administrators, Parent Teacher Association (P.T.A.), Parent  Coordinator, Teachers and additional school personnel work collaboratively to ensure that parents are an integral part of the  school community.  Parent's Language needs are assessed upon student enrollment.  When the Home Language Identification  survey is conducted, a parent's primary language is determined.  Parents in need of translation services are informed of their  rights as per Chancellor's Regulation.  Many staff members are fluent in at least one other language and can communicate with  parents.  In the event that no staff member expresses proficiency in a parent's primary language,  we shall request translation  through the Office of Translation Services.  A variety of activities and workshops are planned throughout the year to encourage  parents to become proactive members of the school community.  A new initiative for parents is the Saturday Institute that  consists of ENL and Technology classes. Through these classes parents of ELLs learn a new language.  In addition, these  programs afford all parents the opportunity to become engaged in community activities and to learn of instructional strategies  and resources that they can utilize at home to support their child’s learning.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Phyllis Raulli, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   PS/IS 384 The Frances E Carter                                                                              School DBN: 32K384  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      The primary languages of all parents, including those of English Language Learners in the school, were initially  assessed and recorded upon completion of the new Home Language Identification form. Additional language  needs are identified through discussions with teachers, parents, the Parent Teacher Association and the Parent  Coordinator. A need for oral and written translations was identified for parents that speak Spanish and Arabic.  The need for Spanish language comprised the overwhelming majority of parents who require written translation  and oral interpretation in our school.   Upon registration, all students' parents answer questions in the Home Language Identification Survey, (HLIS),  which identifies languages spoken in a students' household and the parents' preferred language of  communication for written and verbal correspondence from the school. Information obtained from this document  is entered into ATS, in which a report can be generated which identifies the preferred language of communication  for parents for the entire parental school community.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71      Once a parent's preferred language has been identified, a pedagogue in conjunction with the Parent Coordinator  work collaboratively to ensure adequate written and oral correspondence regarding all school matters in their  preferred language in a timely fashion.  Because the overwhelming majority of parents who indicate a home language other than English are Spanish- speakers as evidenced by data collected from the HLIS, all written correspondence is routinely provided to all  students in both Spanish and English. The remaining identified language is Arabic. These parents are provided  written correspondence in their preferred language.  Additionally, in the event that a parent's preferred language of correspondence is not adequately provided by the  school staff, a request for assistance is made to the Office of Translation Services, pursuant to Chancellor's  Regulations.         2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      . Our safety plan includes protocol to ensure parents' ability to reach administrative offices in the event of an  emergency.             2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73     Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure    Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      Pursuant to Chancellor's Regulations A-663, PS 384 provides information to parents in their designated primary  language regarding language assistance services and their rights in obtaining them. A sign is posted near the primary  entrance describing these rights in all present primary languages at PS/IS 384. Our safety plan includes protocol to  ensure parents' ability to reach administrative offices in the event of an emergency. The Parent Coordinator, in  conjunction with the PTA, will inform the parents of their rights regarding parental notification as per Chancellor's  Regulation A-663.         Additionally, as noted in recent changes to the Chancellor's Regulations A-66e, no minor child is permitted to provide  translation services for school-related matters. Should a parent elect an adult friend or companion to assist in  translation, that shall be permitted. Also, our Parent Coordinator participates in all available Professional  Development provided by Borough Field Support Center and the Translation and Interpretation Unit. Faculty, parents  and administrators are informed of these changes by a designated administrator during faculty meetings, grade level  meetings and parent meetings.                Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      PS/IS 384 provides each parent whose primary language is a covered language and who require language assistance  services with a copy of the Bill of Parent Rights and Responsibilities which includes their rights regarding translation  and interpretation services in their preferred language. Also, the aforementioned notificaton requirements are posted  in a conspicuous location at or near the primary entrance in each of the covered languages, or most prominent  covered languages, indicating the availability of interpretation services. Additionally, our safety plan will contain  procedures for ensuring that parents in need of language access services are not prevented from reaching the school’s  administrative offices solely due to language barriers. Finally, PS/IS 384 has had only two students in the last five years  whose primary language is neither English nor a covered language, so no additional signage will be required at this  time.         Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74         The parent survey and informal conversations are utlilized to gather feedback from parents. Additionally, brochures  provided in the Language Access Kit instruct parents as to how they may provide feedback directly to the Office of  Translation and Interpretation.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          75
