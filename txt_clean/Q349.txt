This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Section 4: CEP Overview            Mission   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      At P.S. 349 we will work to cultivate the future leaders of the world for the 21st century and beyond. In collaboration  with all members of our diverse community, we will address the needs of the whole child, through rigorous  academics, and project-based learning. Students will think critically, communicate effectively and solve real-world  problems. We believe that students thrive in a nurturing environment of trust, safety, and security to grow both  emotionally and academically.      Vision   P.S. 349 is a school of excellence where children can achieve their full leadership potential in academics, creativity and  moral development, thus becoming lifelong learners prepared for the 21st Century and beyond.                        2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    P.S. 349 The Queens School for Leadership & Excellence is a new school that opened in September 2015. In October  of 2017, P.S. 349 was awarded a federal Magnet grant. As a result, the school is now named P.S. 349 Magnet School  for Leadership & Innovation through STEAM. We currently 2 pre-kindergarten classes, 4 kindergarten classes, 3 1st  grade classes, 4 2nd grade classes, and 4 3rd grade classes. We will grow each year with one grade until reaching 5th  grade with approximately 500 students. The school is located in the diverse community of Jamaica, Queens. The  school is projected to provide instruction to students speaking up to 12 different languages.    Creating Process   The school was created to address the growing population of children in District 28 and alleviate the over crowding in  the neighboring schools. The Founding Principal collaborated with a Working Group consisting of Community  Education Council (CEC) members, parents, United Federation of Teachers (UFT) and Council of School Supervisors &  Administrators (CSA) to design the instructional programs and align all facets of the school to the Framework for  Great Schools.      Core Values   At P.S. 349 we believe in:      Life-Long Learning   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      We challenge ourselves to continue our own professional growth and we strive to instill a love of learning in our  students.     Excellence   We excel in all that we do as a collaborative team and we encourage our students to learn collaboratively with their  peers.     Accountability   We establish clear goals, measure progress and take responsibility for results and we teach our students to become  responsible, self-motivated, monitors of their own learning.     Diversity   We appreciate, respect and learn from diverse cultures and teach our students to do the same.            3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   At PS 349 we have growing population of students with disabilities and English language learners. Students continue  to need support to access the rigorous curriculum and the Next Generation Learning Standards. Teachers plan all  lessons to meet the needs of all learners.      4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   The Framework for Great Schools:   For the 2017 - 2018 school year, we have made the most progress in Rigorous Instruction and Effective-School  Leadership areas of the Framework for Great Schools earning a well-developed rating in both areas of the Quality  Review rubric. Although we earned a rating of proficient in Pedagogy (1.2) it is an area of focus for us. PS 349 was  created in alignment with the Framework and the School Quality Rubric. For each element of the framework a blue  print plan was created to ensure alignment and high quality instruction for all students.      It is the culture at P.S. 349 to provide students with high quality instruction. The school selected Teacher’s College  Reading & Writing curriculum and Eureka Math — also known as Engage NY. Teacher’s College Reading and Writing  curriculum is a whole language process approach to the teaching of reading and writing. Students are immersed in  authentic whole text and live a reader and writer’s life. Students will focus on Next Generation Learning Standards  aligned units of study in opinion, informational and narrative texts. Eureka Math is a complete curriculum that  carefully sequences the mathematical progressions into expertly crafted modules. The curriculum ensures that  students can access content at appropriate levels of depth and rigor. Both curricula will support the school in meeting  our goals to provide students with high quality rigorous instruction preparing students to be college and career ready.  Teachers engage in teacher teamwork to analyze data and student work to make adjustments to curricula and ensure  alignment to the Next Generation Learning Standards.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         P.S. 349 developed a partnership with the Leader in Me to rally the community around a common theme and provide  a supportive culture. Students, staff and parents are taught the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. These leadership  skills are taught during morning meeting and infused throughout the school day. This is a three year roll out process  to support students social and emotional development, thus developing the key skills to take on future leaderships  roles in college, careers and beyond. Throughout the school environment teachers speak a common language to  demonstrate high expectations and academic success for all students.       Effective leadership is demonstrated throughout all components of the blue print. The founding principal researched  the academic success of the district and engaged parents in informal discussions to identify the needs and desires of  the community. This research provided the foundation for all facets of the school.       Strong Family-Community Ties is an integral part of the foundation of P.S. 349. A Family Engagement Committee was  established to support the development of an authentic partnership with families and community stakeholders  focused on students’ learning. The school also established a partnership with Learning Leaders to provide parents  with training to volunteer within the school.      Collaboration is an embedded parent of the school culture. Teachers engage in common planning time to analyze  data, student work and ensure rigorous instruction. To build capacity across the school, teacher leaders were  identified to serve on the Instructional Cabinet and Professional Learning Committee. The teacher leaders collaborate  with the principal to make decisions, based on data, about instruction and teachers’ professional development  focused on improving student learning outcomes.      Finally, trust is weaved throughout the school environment. All parents, school staff, students and administrators are  valued and respected while working towards the shared goal of improving students’ learning and preparing for  college or a career.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S. 349 , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the  Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.      Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   P.S. 349 will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;   The school’s Parent Involvement       Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee.

The school opened in 2015 with Pre -K and Kindergarten. We will expand every year  through 5th grade.  Currently, we have Pre-K through third grade.  .  The demographics of the  school consist of 449 students; 1.56% of our students are Caucasian, 34.08% are Hispanic,  19.60% are African American, 38.35% are Asian/Pacific Islander, and 3.12% others.  The  primary goal of our English as a New Language (ENL) program is to embed coherent practice  across the school to deliver quality instruction that supports all children in achieving proficiency  in listening, speaking, reading and writing.  This will provide all students with the skills  necessary to meet the Common Core Learning Standards in reading and writing. We deliver  instruction using the Workshop Model.  In English language arts, we use a Balanced Literacy  Approach to teach reading and writing.  ENL strategies are infused seamlessly into instruction to  support the teachers in making language and content comprehensible.  Supports are provided  using multiple modalities; auditory, oral language development, visual, tactile and  linguistics.  All lessons are planned in advance using a three-tier approach incorporating the  appropriate differentiation, vocabulary comprehension strategies and realia.  Instruction will  further be differentiated for SWDs, and newcomer ELLs with individualized learning goals and  differentiated instruction based on specific needs in each of the modalities: speaking, listening,  reading, and writing. There are no SIFE students participating in the 2018-2019 program. Our  school will be offering an after-school Title III program which will run from December through  end of March. There will be 3 certified ENL teachers delivering instruction in the Title III After  School Program. The sessions are scheduled on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:30 p.m. to  4:30 p.m. The program will consist of 29 sessions. These after school classes will be taught by  licensed ENL teachers  who will also serve as content teachers. The target population for the  Title III after school program is approximately 60 ELLs. We will provide supplemental  instruction in English, in alignment with the NYS ENL Learning Standards and Common Core  Learning Standards. Our focus for grades 1-3 will be on test preparation skills and literacy  through the content area using ENL strategies and methodologies. ESL strategies and a hands-on  approach will be used in order to help students improve their listening, speaking, reading, and  writing skills. Materials will include Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT by Attanasio and  Associates, and Language Power by Teacher Created Materials. We will also focus on improving  reading comprehension, critical thinking and vocabulary development through a balanced  literacy approach.  In addition, ELL students would benefit from supplemental opportunities to  use information gathered from hands on activities to further expand their academic language,  including actively listening for alternative interpretations and ideas.

The Title  III Professional Development Program is designed to strengthen teachers' practice by addressing  strategies that promote academic language development. ENL teachers in the Title III after  school program will attend professional development and planning meetings focused on reading  comprehension. These meetings, led by the ENL Coordinator,  will clearly outline the program  and offer training in the Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT by Attanasio and Associates, and  Language Power by Teacher Created Materials as well as using scaffolds to promote academic  discourse.  These meetings will take place during Monday PD time from 2:20 to 3:45 PM.  Attendance will be tracked through attendance sign in sheets including an agenda.  ENL teachers  will also attend Queens South Field Support ELL workshops, Teacher’s College workshops and  on-site coaching support through the Teacher’s College Reading and Writing Project focused on  ENL methodologies, also tracked with sign in sheets and agendas. Teachers' college on-site  coaching support involves two periods with individual grade teams. ENL teachers will join one  grade team meeting. ENL teachers will turnkey information learned to other pedagogues. In- house Teacher’s College workshops will be led by a staff developer. Queens South Field Support  and Teachers College workshops will be ongoing throughout the school year. In October ENL  teachers will be trained by the ENL coordinator on how to use Language Power by Teacher  Created Materials. In February, ENL teachers will be trained by the ENL coordinator on Getting  Ready for the NYSESLAT by Attanasio and Associates. All PD activities will be tracked  through attendance sign in sheets and agendas kept in the school wide PD binder ENL section as  well as maintained by the ENL Coordinator. By applying what they learn into their daily  instruction, teachers will help strengthen ENL students' language development, comprehension,  and critical thinking skills.

NYSESLAT (March 2019)- 1 session: The purpose of this workshop is to provide parents with  information regarding the NYSESLAT assessment and the implications for their children.  Each class in our school this year is integrating project-based learning. At the end of each  project, teachers will make students’ projects public in a number of ways. The ENL teachers will  work closely with each grade team to ensure that these activities are planned in a way that are  accessible for and inclusive of our non-English speaking families. This will include ensuring  that, when possible, any public displays of projects are presented in home languages represented  in the classes. The ENL teachers will also be available to translate presentations for our Spanish  and Bengali speaking families. All Parental Engagement Activities will be tracked  through attendance and agendas to be maintained and organized by the ENL team.    Part E: Budget   FOR SCHOOLS NOT CONCEPTUALLY CONSOLIDATED ONLY.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  The students are assessed school-wide three times a year (baseline, mid-year and end-of-year) in reading, writing and  math.  In reading we use the Fountas and Pinnell running record assessment to identify students' independent and  instructional reading levels and monitor progress. In writing, we use TCRWP writing on-demand assessments. A baseline  assessment is used to assess early literacy skills and an end of unit assessment is used to monitor the knowledge obtained  from the unit. These assessment tools are used to provide insights to help inform the school’s instructional plan. In addition,  teachers use various forms of formative assessments such as conferencing notes, classroom assessments, and anecdotal  records to track students’ achievement. The data collected also helps inform instructional decisions for grouping all students  including the ELLs according to their needs with emphasis on the four language modalities.      2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      The school has implemented a curriculum, which incorporates a balanced literacy focus across all grade levels. During the  reading block where tiered, small group activities promote phonological awareness/phonics, high-frequency words,  vocabulary, and comprehension, the teacher is also working in small, guided reading groups. This enables students to work in a  structured environment, which promotes independent and collaborative learning.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  The success of the program is evaluated through the NYSESLAT data, NYC Math Performance Task, classroom assessments,  informal anecdotal records and formal assessments. The student's individual success in all content areas is monitored through  progress reports, running records and informal assessments from the ENL instructors. Student’s success is also evaluated by  mastery of grade-level academic standards.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Once the summative data has been gathered, the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework is implemented into the school’s  daily instructional plan.  Students who are identified as being in Tier 1 are exposed to a rigorous curriculum, which includes  language development for ELLs. Those students who are identified as Tier 2 participate in academic intervention groups where  instruction and assessments are differentiated to meet their needs, in addition to teaching the core instruction. Intensive and  individualized instruction that focuses on a small, targeted set of skills is given to those students identified as Tier 3 in a small  group setting. Wilson’s Fundations is implemented school-wide to help provide multi-sensory support for foundational skills  with an emphasis on phonemic awareness, phonics and word study to help bridge our balanced literacy program.  Our Title III  after-school program will provide instruction with a focus on literacy using ENL strategies and methodologies a well as  improving reading comprehension, critical thinking and vocabulary development. In addition, ELL students benefit from  supplemental opportunities to use information gathered from hands on activities to further expand their academic language,  including actively listening for alternative interpretations and ideas. Students are placed in literacy stations that address their  individual proficiency levels and whose data help with creating explicit instruction based on their academic needs.  Continuous  monitoring of these results ensure that students are being supported adequately throughout the year.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   The school uses the NYCDOE RtI model to provide intervention support services. For example, the NYCDOE RtI model is based  on three tiers of instruction and intervention. The levels of intervention and instruction increase in duration and intensity over  time. As students improve, the data is measured by “reliable and valid” assessments and the extra supports are removed. The  RtI components used for screening and implementation are as follows:  1. Universal Screening -  • Used to establish a baseline of student performance and identify students not making academic progress at the expected  rates.  • Gives clear indications of risk in specific domains.  • The established assessments “point out” risks which is usually not apparent from classroom interactions alone.  • Identifies ELL students needing targeted instructional support to “bolster” development in literacy.  2. Strong Core Instruction –  • Tier 1 instruction is delivered to all students in the general classroom by qualified teachers. Strengthening classroom  instruction is a key step in supporting ELLs at-risk by providing a critical step in implementing the RtI model.             3. Intensive, targeted intervention is provided to support ELLs who are not showing sufficient progress on the skills  and/or   competencies measured.  4. Progress monitoring informs how at-risk students are responding to instruction.     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         We evaluate the success of our ENL Program by collecting, analyzing and using the data obtained from NYSITELL, NYSESLAT,  NYC Math Performance Task, Fountas and Pinnell running record assessments and additional informal assessments given to  English Language Learners throughout the school year.        7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Teachers use the data to measure the effectiveness of the program. This helps us to guide the instruction of the ENL program  and assesses the needs of students in the four modalities. Success for these students is measured by how they are performing  in the classroom on a daily basis and not just on test results. We look at student portfolios and notebooks, feedback from  classroom teachers, individual student conferences, and formal and informal assessments. The results on the NYSESLAT clearly  show that our students are making consistent gains towards achieving language proficiency. Our ENL teachers will continue to  support the efforts of the mainstream teacher. Classroom teachers meet weekly in teacher teams to analyze data and student  work, then make adjustments to unit plans and lessons to meet the needs of all learners; including ENL students.           Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   1). Our school currently uses the integrated and stand-alone organizational models for ENL.  2). The ENL teacher works with ENL students during literacy instruction.  The teacher collaborates with the general  education classroom teachers to provide language acquisition and vocabulary support.  The ENL teacher plans during  common preparation time with classroom teachers to address the needs of the ENL students.  The teachers focus on  ENL strategies. For example, total physical response and whole language, as well as explicit instruction that  incorporates the components of balanced literacy are used to help students gain both fluency and comprehension in  the English language.  In conjunction with supporting the advancement of the children's oral expression, the teacher  provides read alouds to the students, which gives them opportunities to respond to literature through writing and  drawing. During stand-alone sessions, students are grouped homogeneously according to proficiency levels or need  for English-acquisition focused instruction.  3). The school has spent a lot of time in analyzing, and researching the student data in order to implement an  effective instructional program for ELLs. However, it is important to mention that the implementation of the co- teaching model has given the teachers across all grades the opportunity to collaboratively plan and adjust instruction,  assess, monitor progress and provide an in-depth knowledge of students from different perspectives. For instance,  the ENL teacher can offer an ELL perspective to the mainstream teacher during instructional planning.4). Students  who are heterogeneously mixed, receive integrated services within the classroom. Stand-alone services are provided  using homogeneous grouping using thematic units that address all four modalities.   b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     n/a      c.  DL program.  If applicable.      n/a      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      The ENL teacher provides mandated instructional time each week. Our Entering and Emerging level students receive 360 total  minutes (8 periods) of ENL instruction, our Transitioning and Expanding students receive 180 total minutes (4 periods) of ENL  instruction and our Commanding students receive 90 minutes (2 periods) of instruction. All instruction is in compliance with  the CR Part 154 requirements for English as a New Language. Students will receive the required minutes of both standalone  ENL and integrated ENL services based on their proficiency level. The proficiency level of each ELL is communicated with the  classroom teacher so that differentiated instruction can be provided based on individual proficiency needs.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Our ENL program provides language, literacy and content area instruction. Data from interim assessments, running records,  performance tasks, baseline assessments, individual students conferences and monthly assessments in math and ELA are used  to drive instruction. Literacy instruction is provided each day through the use of read-alouds, shared reading, guided reading,  shared and individual writing. Grade level content instruction in Social Studies, Science and Math is also provided during  integrated ENL instruction. The ENL teacher uses math manipulatives, posters, maps, pictures, graphic organizers, trade books,  big books, realia, picture dictionaries and multi-media support in order to make the content more comprehensible. Native  language support through the use of picture dictionaries and peer tutoring is used when necessary.  Academic rigor and  consistency are the keys to our student's success. The ENL teacher works closely with the classroom teachers in order to align  the ENL instruction with content area instruction in each grade. Scaffolding strategies such as pre-teaching vocabulary, using  prior knowledge, modeling, and contextualization are woven throughout each lesson. Instruction is designed to address the  needs of learners at each proficiency level so that language and cognitive skills are developed through content topics and  themes. All content area instruction is aligned with the Common Core Standards in ELA and Math and the New York State  Standards in Science and Social Studies. The ENL teacher and content area teachers use formal and informal assessments to  determining movement toward content standards.                          4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   PS 349  ensures that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their native language by providing translated versions of NYC Math  Performance Task. Students also have access to multi-cultural books to enhance their language acquisition.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status    Teacher's College Reading & Writing Program and Eureka/Engage NY provide differentiated strategies for ENL  students.    Former ENL students will receive support services for two years after reaching the proficient/command level.    a). Currently there are no SIFE students at P.S. 349. If SIFE students were to be enrolled in our school in the future, then those  students returning to school would be given a brief informal assessment of their basic skills and knowledge of English. The  student is reintroduced to the classroom environment through displaying language and content objectives and presented with  information in varied ways including written demonstration and manipulatives. Once the student has adapted in their  classroom environment, they will follow the structured ELL program that is currently in place.  If there is a need for additional  intervention, the ENL teachers will meet their needs.  b). The main focus of the newcomer instruction is to scaffold support to  have access to the curriculum.  In addition to developing students basic English, vocabulary and foundational skills with their  content area teacher and ENL teacher.  The program is adapted to address students needs. Focus is placed on utilizing the  skills acquired in their first years to develop stronger abilities across all modalities.  c). ENL students receiving services 4 to 6 years will receive extensive academic support in reading, writing, and math.  The AIS  teachers will provide extra support in content area instruction and supplemental support with a reduced student to teacher  ratio. The ENL teacher will focus on addressing weaknesses in reading comprehension, fluency, writing mechanics and writing  content. The goal for these students is to continue to improve their reading and writing skills.  We are a K-5 school as a result,  we will not have long-term ENLs.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56      d). Our former ELLs will continue to receive unlimited time on all assessments. They will also receive 90 minutes of ENL  instruction in the content area. They will also be invited to attend our after school sessions. The ENL teacher will continue to  monitor their progress and will confer with the classroom teacher to identify any areas of concern.      6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   There are a variety of strategies used to accelerate English language learners and student with disabilities development.  The  ESL teacher provides extra support using visuals, Total Physical Response (TPR), and Kinesthetic learning.  All classroom  teachers will also incorporate accountable talk, technology (Raz-Kids, StarFall, IXL) and  Fundations to support students'  needs.  In math, students are provided with manipulatives to conceptually understand and solve problems.  The ENL teacher  uses multiple scaffolding strategies with these students in order to reinforce what they have learned, such as pre-teaching  content vocabulary, using prior knowledge, providing sentence starters, using graphic organizers and modeling. Our ELL-SWDs  have access to word walls, picture dictionaries, the Internet and other age and grade appropriate tools that are available to  provide extra support when needed. The ENL teacher has a copy of their IEPs so that their assignments can be modified when  necessary to best meet their academic needs and to ensure that they are receiving all mandated services.                        7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Our school provides every opportunity to enable diverse ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and attain English proficiency  within the least restrictive environment. Our ELL-SWD's are mainstreamed during pull-out sessions.  Differentiation of  resources, process and product are incorporated into lessons to meet their needs.  The kinesthetic, tactile and visuals are  infused into our lessons.  We support our ELLs-SWD by using flexible scheduling and push-in/pull-out models.   We currently  have eight students who are in a self-contained class. These students receive their ENL services in a group with other students  with special needs  and are taught according to their individual needs. Curriculum is modified as needed, and individual  assistance and peer tutoring is provided so that they can fully participate in the ENL class.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  Students are provided with small group instruction through our RTI tier I support. At PS 349, we focus on providing quality  instruction in the classroom for student that need interventions to limit the amount of time out of the classroom.  Teachers  use data to group students and provide targeted interventions focused on language acquisition and vocabulary development.  These services are provided in English.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      For next school year, we will use data to explore additional programs to support our Response to Intervention Program.  We  will incorporate the Fountas and Pinnell Leveled Literacy Intervention into our AIS/RTI program and Getting Ready for the  NYSESLAT by Attanasio and Associates, INC into our after-school program. Students will also be exposed to different  residencies (Music, Art, and Science).     10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   This does not apply to P.S. 349.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All students are programmed for the core subjects in addition to music, visual arts, physical education, technology and drama.  All students will be encouraged to participate in before and after school programs. Ells are also exposed to to different  residencies which incorporates music, art, and science.      12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57         We are currently using Teacher's College Reading and Writing Project curriculum, Engage NY Math, New York City Scope and  Sequence for science and Passport for social studies, Fundations, Raz-Kids and IXL.  All curricula and programs provide support  for ELL students. All curriculum is used as a resource to scaffold and provide multiple entry point into instruction.  Visuals are  provide help build vocabulary and content for each child.           13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Native language support in the ENL program is delivered through the use of bilingual dictionaries and trade books in the native  language, peer tutoring, and extra help from our bilingual staff members.         14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    The ENL teacher delivers services for the required amount of time using grade appropriate content and language. Teachers are  provided with professional learning through Education Consortium LLC and in house professional development from our ENL  team to support ELL students.  ENL teacher consults with teachers during common planning time to meet the needs of the ENL  students.      15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    Although we share the building, we do not share the resources because we are a K-5 school and the other school is a middle  school. We are currently using Teacher's College Reading and Writing Project curriculum, Engage NY Math, Amplify Science,  New York City Scope and Sequence and Passport for Social Studies, Fundations, and Reading Rescue.  All curricula and  programs provide support for ELL students. All curricula is used as a resource to scaffold and provide multiple entry point into  instruction.

Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   n/a       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  ENL teachers attend monthly workshops facilitated through Teacher's College and the District Office. The workshops are  focused on balanced literacy, ELL compliance and ELL strategies to support instruction.  The ENL teachers will attend ELL   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58         related workshops given by Teacher's College in order to support and engage ELLs in the Common Core Learning Standards.  Teachers will also attend workshops led by Education Consortium LLC. Teachers are provided with strategies to support  students in all areas of speaking, listening, reading and writing.         2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Our school will meet the professional development requirements for all teachers through in-house professional development  led by teachers and administration. Teachers will attend ELL related workshops given by Teacher's College and Education  Consortium LLC. Teachers will also engage in 3 cycles of professional learning focusing on delivering a quality mini-lesson,  conferencing, small group instruction and supporting the needs of ELLs and SWDS.  The coach will model and observe lessons  and provide teachers with feedback. An agenda and attendance will be kept to maintain a records of professional  development activities. Teachers will  be provided with professional development focused on vocabulary development and  language acquisition, which is the school's instructional focus.         Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   The ENL teachers will meet with parents or guardians of English language learners at least once a year, in addition to parent- teacher conferences, initial parent orientations, and quarterly progress meetings to discuss the goals of the program, their  child’s language development progress, their child’s English language proficiency assessment results, and language  development needs in all content areas.  The meeting will include a qualified interpreter/translator in the language or mode of  communication the parent or guardian best understands. We currently have translation available on site in Spanish and  Bengali.     2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   We offer monthly family activities related to instruction to welcome all families to the school environment.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Tanya Bates-Howell, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   The Queens School for Leadersh                                                                              School DBN: 28Q349  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

P.S. 349, The Queens School for Leadership & Excellence is an elementary located in Jamaica, Queens. The school  opened in 2015 with Pre -K and Kindergarten. We will expand every year through 5th grade. Currently, we have  Pre-K through third grade. The demographics of the school consist of 449 students; 1.56% of our students are  Caucasian, 34.08% are Hispanic, 19.60% are African American , 38.53% are Asian/Pacific Islander, and 3.12%  others. When parents registered their child, they completed a home language survey in their home language. This  was administered by a pedagogue and the completed registration documents identified their preferred method  of oral and written communication. Upon entering the school there are posters to support the preferred language  of communication and staff members are available to translate as needed. As of now 57% of parents have  requested written communication in English and 55% of parents have requested oral communication in English.  Approximately 18% of the parents have requested written communication in Bengali and 20% on the parents   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62      requested oral communication in Bengali.
