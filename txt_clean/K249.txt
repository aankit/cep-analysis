This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The mission of our school is to promote the Six Exceptional Sytems:   Section 4: CEP Overview        Culture of Universal Achievement    Collaboration      Assessment    Data Analysis   Standards Alignment   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9           Interventions     P.S. 249 creaates a college readiness culture, focuses on the growth of each student, sets high expectations, involves  parents and community and always seeks to improve.         2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   P.S. 249, The Caton School, which services grades Pre K-5, is located in the Flatbush/Kensington section of Brooklyn in  Community School District 17. The district, as well as the school’s population is diverse, representing immigrants from  more than 56 countries including the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Guyana, in addition to many other African,  Caribbean, South American, Middle Eastern and Asian nations. Most of these students have arrived in the U.S. within  the last three years, therefore English is a new language for many of our students and their parents. Within this  diverse ethnic background, PS 249 offers academic programs that aim to engage all students’ learning styles, promote  bilingualism and foster an appreciation for different cultures. As of the 2018-19 school year we will have two full day  Pre-Kindergarten classes, 20 general education classes, 5 Spec. Education classes, 6 Spanish dual language classes and  6 English as a New Language (ENL) classes.      PS 249 has developed a partnership with Teachers College, Fordham University and Medgar Evers College. Our  partnerships with these colleges afford us the opportunity to work closely with consultants that are grade specific.  The consultants work closely in developing effective pedagogy that is aligned to the Common Core Standards.  Teachers College, provides consultants in the area of English Language Arts, Fordham extends their expertise and  their consultants in the area of Science, ranging from queries to professional development. Grades 2- 5 teachers work  with the National Training Network (NTN) due to our partnership with Medgar Evers College Pipeline. As a result, NTN  consultants work closely with the teachers building on the Mathematics Common Core Standards.   PS 249 is the Recipient of the National Title 1 Recognition Award For 2017-18. PS 249, The Caton School is one of up  to 100 schools throughout the country that is being nationally recognized for exceptional student achievement in  2017. A project of the National Title I Association, the National Title I Distinguished Schools Program publicly  recognizes qualifying Title I schools for the outstanding academic achievements of their students. It highlights the  efforts of schools across the country making significant improvements for their students. The program has been in  place since 1996, highlighting the success of hundreds of schools in one of three categories:     Category 1: Exceptional student performance for two consecutive years     Category 2: Closing the achievement gap between student groups     Category 3: Excellence in serving special populations of students Title I is the cornerstone of the Elementary  and Secondary Education Act. It is the largest federally funded pre-college education program in the United  States and provides funding to school districts across the country to aid in the education of economically  disadvantaged students.      PS 249 is also a part of the PROSE community. The Progressive Redesign Opportunity for Schools of Excellence  (PROSE) program enables schools who have a demonstrated record of effective school leadership, collaboration, and  trust to implement innovative practices outside of existing rules. Administrators and teachers collaboratively engage  in school improvement efforts guided by the Framework for Great Schools and leverage granted flexibilities in the  UFT and/or CSA contracts, as well as Chancellor's and/or state regulations in order to increase student achievement.  The PROSE program is designed to:   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      1.  Foster continuous innovation to challenge some of the basic rules and regulation under which they have   historically operated in service of improved student outcomes.   2.  Foster collaboration within and across school communities.   PS 249 is also a part of The Learning Partners Program (LLP) for the past 4 years. PS 249 has served as a model school  for several schools across NYC sharing best practices in ELA and Mathematics. The LLP is designed to promote inter  school collaborative learning and leverage the rich reservoir of expertise that already resides within our school  communities to improve the educational experience for all New York City students.   Using the Framework for Great Schools as a focal lens, the Learning Partners Program matches a host school that  exhibits strong practices in a specific learning focus area with two or more partner schools that are interested in  strengthening their own practices in that area.    Parent workshops are provided on an ongoing basis by our Teachers and full time Parent Coordinator. Topics of  Parent Workshops include Immigration, Common Core Learning Standards, Parenting, and Technology. Parents are  engaged in various learning activities and participate on various committees such as: Parent Teacher Association,  Learning Leaders and the School Leadership Team. They also support content area instruction through participation in  class and school-wide celebrations, class trips, and assemblies. Our volunteer Foster Grandparents, who are members  of our community, work with our students by reading books aloud to them on a daily basis, as well as assisting the  children with their academic and social needs.      The dual language program at PS 249 provides integrated language proficiency and cross - cultural understanding.  Grade Level curriculum in the content areas are taught to all students through both English and Spanish and organized  around major concepts that students are expected to learn while developing academic language.      PS 249 offers many after school and morning school programs. Some of which include the following: English Language  Learners Academy (ELLA) and after school programs for grades 1 and 2 students in the ENL program, After school for  all students in grades 3 through 5. Morning Reading and Math programs for all grade 3 through 5 students. We also  offer weekly Monday Clubs that include Science, Art, Dance, Music, Reading, Mathematics, and Gym.            3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   The student population is comprised of 874 students, of which 216 students or roughly 24% are ENL’s. 194 ENL’s are  in dual language classes, 119 are in ENL classes and 20 ENL students have Individualized Education Plan (IEP's). It is the  school’s philosophy that instituting a comprehensive program in literacy and mathematics will allow all students,  including Students With Disabilities (SWD's) and English as a New Language (ENL's) to develop high levels of  proficiency in order to meet the Common Core Learning Standards in English Language Arts, Mathematics, Social  Studies and Science, Accordingly, our ENL's, as well as our SWD's need to focus on Listening, Speaking, and Writing,  Part 154 requirements, as well as a statistically significant Annual Yearly Progress (AYP).      4.

Our teaching  community connects with our students and their parents, ensuring a nurturing atmosphere that prepares our student  population to successfully achieve college and career readiness in order to compete in a global world.      During the 2017-18 school year, our pedagogical practices strengthened as evidenced in Framework for Great  Schools: Lesson plans designed to reflect teacher knowledge of students with lessons designed with multiple entry  points so that all students have access to the same rigorous instruction, Small group instruction based on data from  formative and summative assessments addressed the needs for all students to maximize student learning. According  to the 2017-18 NYC School Survey 95 percent of all parents are satisfied with their children’s education, 99 percent of  all teachers agree that school leaders place a high standard on student learning, 98 percent of all teachers would  recommend our school to parents.      PS 249’s challenges are understood by the staff. While our 2017-18 NYS Math test date shows a 1% increase from the  2016-17 school year, it is a minimal increase. Our NYS ELA test data from the 2017-18 school year shows an overall  increase by 7% . Although we have shown an increase in our bottom third population, we still see a need to promote  student independence so that students are able to self and peer assess in order to effectively revise their work. In  addition, to deepen instructional practices so that the delivery of instruction elicits higher order thinking and extends  learning for all students through multiple entry points. Finally to improve our teacher teams in order to align and  analyze student work with assessment checklists and feedback so that students can be grouped and prepare tasks  that are at multiple entry points.               2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 17K249   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   PK,0K,01,02,03,04, 05   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   873   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   YES   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  As a result of an analysis of in house assessments, benchmarks, MOSL, as well as the NYS ELA Exam, and the NYS  Maths Exam over the past two years, we found that our students scoring at Level 1 decreased by 3%, our Level 2’s  remained the same at 32% and our Level 3’s and 4’s increased by 2%, thus leading to an overall change of 7% on the  NYS ELA Exam. Reading Level Benchmarks indicate that as of June 2018, 55% of all students are at or above  benchmark levels, 49% of the Hispanic/Latino Population are at or above IRL benchmark level, 61% of the  Black/African Population are at or above IRL benchmark level, ENL population benchmark level is 41% at or above and  our SWD student population is 29% at or above benchmark. The NYS Math Exam showed our students scoring at Level  1 stayed constant at 7%, our level 2's increased by 2%, and our Level 3's and 4's also had no change, thus showing that  this past school year there was a 1% change. Based on this data and our school needs we have determined that our  students need to understand what they are learning, how they will know that they have learned it, and why they are  learning this. We will do this by improving teacher clarity - clear kid- friendly teaching points and/or goal - setting,  establishing assessment criteria and constructing knowledge during cycles of feedback so that students take  ownership of their learning and continue to strengthen their abilities. Henceforth, we have made providing feedback  in order for our students to take ownership of their learning a priority this year.         Part 2 – Annual Goal   Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this  element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment.

To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.  (Refer to Galaxy for  school allocation  amounts)   Place an (X) in Column A below to verify  that the school has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are  consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35      achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.

The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. PS 249K, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.       Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   PS 249 will support parents and families of Title I students by:  • Providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math and use of technology;  • Providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;  • Fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;  • Providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      • Sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format and in  languages that parents can understand;  • Providing professional development opportunities to school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;    The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       Parental Involvement and School Quality   In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:  • Actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;  • Engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated directly  to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;  • Ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;  • Support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;   • Maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and the  families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed  needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is  welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned  for parents each month and file a report with the central office.;  • Conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability  grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;   • Provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report,  Learning Environment Survey Report;  • Host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);  • Schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;  • Translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;   • Conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;      Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:  • Holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      • Hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;  • Encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;  • Supporting or hosting Family Day events;  • Establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;  • Encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;  • Providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their children’s  progress;  • Developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school  activities and student progress;  • Providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between /teacher and the home in a format,  and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand      School-Parent Compact (SPC)   PS 249K, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is  implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between  the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I,  agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for  improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure  that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Our school uses TCRWP Assessment Pro for Independent Reading Levels as an assessment for early literacy skills.  Many of our  ENL's independent reading levels are below grade level and/or approaching grade level in grades K-3.  ENL's may be struggling  with monitoring their reading or using reading strategies while they read.  Teachers will use the students’ reading levels for  guided reading groups in order to support and guide the the students with text on their instructional level.  Classroom teachers  helps students develop an understanding of the text while prompting them to apply strategies they will need to become  independent readers.  ENL's in the Spanish dual language classes are assessed for Independent Reading Levels in their native  language as well.    During reader's workshop teachers teach mini lessons relating to specific skills or strategies that students can apply before,   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49      during and after reading.  As students read independently, teachers confer with students to record  their progress on applying  and transfering the new skill and/or strategy.       Grades K through 2 teachers are trained in Reading Reform.  This program is designed to show teachers how to use phonics- based approaches, as well as how to employ the multisensory techniques of teaching and learning.         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   Teachers are required to assess students reading levels five times during the school year using TCRWP Assessment  Pro.  Teachers are able to access and enter their own data to monitor students’ independent reading levels.  K & 1 teachers are  able to use the other assessments to monitor students’ concept of print, letter sounds, high frequency words  too.  ENL's reading levels in the Spanish dual language classes will be assessed in their native language as well as in English.     K - 3 teachers will meet with flexible guided reading groups on a daily basis, supporting them as they learn to use reading  strategies and specific skills to advance to the next level.    In K – 2,  teachers schedule 20 minutes of Reading Reform each day.  This program teaches all students alphabetic code and  skills of blending sounds for reading and segmenting the spoken word for spelling – whether they learn to read easily or find it  difficult.     3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Using the results from NYSESLAT, teachers will be using the ENL's proficiency level to guide instruction (e.g., minutes per week  and areas of weaknesses within the four modalities - Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing).     ENL's in Kindergarten through Grade 5 that are performing in Entering and/or Emerging levels, as well as reading below grade  level will be given intervention.    Using the results from the New York State ELA & Math tests, classroom teachers will be using the proficiency level to provide  ENL's with additional interventions.  Teachers will use item analysis reports to break down student performance to item and  skills levels and provide distractor analysis to pinpoint common errors.     4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    A team of teachers (data specialist, RTI team leader, ENL coach, ELA coach & Math coach) use the summative data that has  been gathered to determine students’ eligibility to receive additional and more targeted instruction.  If the data shows that  the ENL's are struggling readers, then they will receive an intensive, small-group supplementary literacy intervention program  – the Fountas & Pinnell Leveled Literacy Intervention System K – 12 (LLI).    Eligible ENL's in grades 1 & 2 will attend ELLA (English Language Learner Academy) to receive instruction in English to promote  oral language development by using thematic units of study.  Each content-based, thematic unit of study promotes oral  language development as well as Listening and Speaking standards into action.  Teachers can scaffold oral language  development by providing language, including grammar and vocabulary, for questions and answers.  Whether written or  oral, teachers are providing structure and practice for a new way of speaking and interacting and building academic language  skills.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   Our school uses on-going data from grade-wide assessments, TCRWP Reading Assessment, unit assessments, NYSESLAT, and  state-wide assessments to identify and monitor our bottom third students (at-risk, ENL's, SWD's, etc).  Teachers and RTI  providers have data conversations with administration about their students to determine if they need Tier 2 and Tier 3  interventions as well as the current Tier 1 interventions provided.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50           Next we provide the bottom third with additional Tier 1 services such as RTI (AIS)  Integrated ENL or Standalone ENL for ELA  and Math during the day.  Bottom thirds in grades 3 through 5 attend Literacy & Math Common Core Afterschool as well as  Saturday Common Core School to receive additional interventions in ELA and Math. ENL's who scored Entering, Emerging  and/or Transitional in Grades 1 & 2 will attend ELLA (English Language Learner Afterschool) on Wednesdays & Thursdays but  not limited to Expanding and Commanding students.  The teachers will provide additional interventions using ENL instruction  and/or native language instruction if needed to ensure that the students will benefit from the intervention.            6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   Prior data from NYSESLAT is used to evaluate and inform our ENL programs – ELLA, Grades 3 – 5 Literacy & Math Common  Core Afterschool and Saturday Common Core School.  NYSESLAT data allows us to measure the progress of English language  skills in listening, speaking, reading and writing and determine the proficiency levels (Entering, Emerging, Transitional,  Expanding & Commanding).  NYSESLAT scores identify ENL's that should continue to receive ENL services, as well as plan  strategic homogeneous linguistic groupings.     The data from ELA & Math is used to determine the progress of ENL's as well as former ENL's by the proficiency levels (Level 1,  Level 2, Level 3 & Level 4) and the scale score.  ELA and Math scores identify ENL's and former ENL's that should receive RTI as  well as Grades 3-5 Literacy & Math Common Core Afterschool and Saturday Common Core School.  .     7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   The data specialist as well as our RTI Team Leader in our school support and disseminate written reports based on the analysis  of data, interpret the findings and provide conclusions and recommendations from multiple assessments.         Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   The Freestanding ENL program is self-contained as well as heterogeneous.  ENL's are performing in different  proficiency levels.  A certified ENL teacher will provide instruction to develop English language skills so that students  can succeed in core content courses.      b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     We currently do not have TBE program.   c.  DL program.  If applicable.      Our DL program is heterogeneous.  Students are performing in different proficiency levels in HLA (math, SS & Science)  as well as in ENL.  ENL's continue to develop their home language as well as English language skills throughout  schooling.  In addition, English proficient students are given the opportunity to learn a new language.  Dual language  programs serve both ENL students in need of English language development and monolingual English proficient  students who are interested in learning a second language.  Students in a dual language remain in the program even  after the student reaches the proficient/commanding level on the NYSESLAT (former ENL status).      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51      2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?      All ENL's are held to the same high academic standards as our monolingual students.  All students including ENL's participate  in a 120 minute literacy block, which incorporates the components of the balance literacy program, including read aloud,  shared reading, guided reading, partner reading and the writing workshop in ENL and/or NLA.  NLA and ENL (2 units of study  per week) instruction is embedded into the literacy block for all ENL's in Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding and  Commanding level.     3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Students in the free standing ENL stand-alone model receive all instruction in English across all content areas with native  language support (e.g. bilingual dictionaries, technology, buddy system, classroom libraries including child's native  language).  The students that receive ENL instruction are determined by NYSITELL and/or NYSESLATresults.  Students receive  the workshop model which consists of mini-lessons, word works(Reading Reform),guided, shared & independent reading  (TCRWP) while using ENL methodologies.  ENL methodologies and scaffolding are also used in other content areas such as  mathematics (Engage NY, Math in Focus, NTN), science(FOSS) and social studies.  On-going assessments and measurable goals  help to make content comprehension in order to enrich language development.       Students in the Dual Language program receive instruction in English to support English language development in ELA through  the ELA workshop model which consists of mini-lessons, word works (Reading Reform), guided, shared & independent reading  TCRWP). In the content areas of math, science and SS, students continue to develop their home languages which the teachers  use Native Language acquisition strategies.  Teachers provide scaffolding strategies such as modeling, bridging and  contextualization in the content areas .  On-going assessments in both languages (English & Spanish) and measurable goals  help to make content comprehension in order to enrich language development.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   ENL's in Dual Language programs, use Math & Science Unit Assessments, as well as NYS Math and Science tests.  These  assessments are given in Spanish alongside English as a support.  In grades 3 and higher - ENL's continue to take the ELE exam  to determine their proficiency in their home language.        5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status      a.  SIFE    We currently do not have any SIFE students; however, if so, these students will receive rigorous grade level instruction in all  content areas, taught in their native language and English.  In addition, they will receive 8 periods of ENL instruction per  week.  ENL's that are in US schools for less than three years and are entering, emerging and transitional students will receive  360 minutes of ENL instruction per week, in compliance with CR Part 154-2 instructional requirements.  All expanding students  will receive 180 minutes of ENL instruction per week, in compliance with CR Part 154-2 instructional requirements.  Our school  will provide rigorous grade level instruction fully aligned with the SED ESL Learning Standards and SED NLA Standards in all   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      content areas.  We will provide afterschool programs, ELLA and Saturday School.  ENL's that have special needs or IEP’s will be  provided with related services which include Speech Therapy, Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, Guidance Counseling  and/or SETSS.  ENL testing accommodations for ENL's will be provided during all assessments.  SIFE students will receive  researched based programs such as Reading Reform and Leveled Literacy Intervention to promote new language acquisition in  English.  On-line programs such as iXL, Max Scholar, iReady and etc. will be another source of intervention.    b.  Newcomer    Our newcomers (ENL's in school less than three years) receive support in all areas of their educational endeavor.  As a result of  HLIS, NYSITELL & NYSESLAT data, newcomers are placed in their appropriate setting (ENL self-contained, Dual Language  [Spanish & English] or TBE) by parental options.  Once placed in an organizational model (ENL or Dual Language) the ENL's are  given mandated instruction in ENL and/or NLA per week as per CR Part 154-2 instructional requirements.  In addition, the  ENL's are immersed in a variety of school-wide programs such as afterschool - Literacy and Math Common Core Afterschool,  ELLA, and Saturday Common Core Academy.  ENL testing accommodations will be provided during all assessments.  The  newcomers will receive researched-based programs such as Reading Reform and Leveled Literacy Intervention to promote  English language acquisition.    c.  Developing    Our ENL's receiving service 4 to 6 years receive support in all areas of their educational path.  As a result, NYSESLAT will be  used to plan instruction for these students according to areas of needs across the four modalities – listening/speaking and  reading/writing.  Once placed in an organizational model, (ENL or Dual Language), the students will remain in their program  and are given the mandated instruction in ENL and/or NLA per week as per CR Part 154 instructional requirements.  In  addition, the students are immersed in a variety of school-wide programs such as afterschool - Literacy and Math Common  Core Afterschool, ELLA, and Saturday Common Core Academy.  These students that are in testing grades which will continue to  receive academic intervention based on data received from assessments (formative & summative) in small-group instruction  and ELL testing accommodations will be provided during all assessments.  Research-based programs such as Reading Reform  and Leveled Literacy Intervention to promote English language acquisition if ENL students are below standards.      d.  Long Term    At the current time, we do not have Long-Term ENL's.  If we have students in NYC for more than 6 years or more, we will  provide rigorous grade level instruction fully aligned with the SED ENL Learning Standards and SED NLA Standards in all content  areas.  We will provide afterschool programs from Title III.  ENL's that have special needs or IEP's will be given their  appropriate related services which may include SETSS, Speech Therapy, Physical Therapy, and Guidance Counseling.  ENL  testing accommodations will be provided during all assessments.  We will offer intervention programs such as Reading Reform  & Leveled Literacy Intervention as well as additional on-line programs.    e.  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status     Former ENL's who tested Proficient/Commanding on the NYSESLAT will continue to receive the recommended ENL instruction  - 90 minutes and native language instruction for the next two years.  Former ENL's-SWD's will be given their appropriate  related services which may include SETSS, Speech Therapy, Physical Therapy, and Guidance Counseling.  In addition, Former  ENL's are afforded opportunities for Literacy & Math Common Core Afterschool, and Saturday Common Core School.  ENL  testing accommodations for Former ENL's will be provided for the next two years during all assessments.                     6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      ENL-SWDs whose IEP mandates ENL instruction receive integrated ENL to build English language skills through content area  instruction.  It is delivered by a certified ENL teacher.  2 units of study per week (360 minutes) will be delivered to ENL-SWD's  who are entering or emerging.  1 unit of study per week (180 minutes) will be delivered to ENL-SWD's who are transitioning,  and/or expanding and 90 minutes for commanding ENL-SWD students.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  Teachers of ENL-SWD and ENL teachers create a flexible schedule to meet the needs of ENL units of study per week for ENL- SWDs.  In grades K - 2, the ENL-SWDs are in a 12-1-1.  They receive OT, PT, Speech and ENL throughout the week.  In grades 3- 5, the ENL-SWDs are in ICT classes.  ENL-SWD's that are in integrated or standalone ENL receive ENL units of study per week by  the ENL teachers.  Teachers of ENL-SWD, ENL teachers, RTI providers and out-of-the-classroom teachers have access to ENL- SWDs' IEP on SESIS.  The entire school uses reading and writing program from TCRWP.  Each grade level, consultants provide  professional development on each unit of study.  ENL teachers and SWDs teachers use a variety of strategies and ENL  methodologies to support  ENL'-SWDs in reading and writing.  ENL is embedded within the curriculum and ENL teachers plan  out teaching points and language objectives using all 4 modalities - Speaking, Listening, Reading and Writing in all content  areas.       8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  In grades 3-5, RTI providers push-in to all the grade 3 - 5 classrooms and provide small group instruction for one hour. After  administration of various assessments (on-demand, pre & post assessments in Reading, Writing, SS, Science and Math),  teachers group the students including ENL's for small group intervention with RTI.  From Mondays through Wednesdays, RTI  teachers provide instruction in English with home language support, emphasizing English language acquisition for Reading and  Writing in all content areas (ELA, Science & SS) and Thursdays and Fridays the targeted instruction is in math.  Using the data  from the assessments, the targeted instruction focuses on the areas of needs.    In grade 2, a reading specialist provides instruction in English with home language support emphasizing English language  acquisition as an additional support at least 1 unit per week.  At risk students and/or ENL - SWD's will participate in LLI (Level  Literacy Intervention) program provided by SETSS & licensed pedagogues.  After administering Teacher's College running  records, students including ENL's that are reading far below grade level are selected to participate in an intervention called  Leveled Literacy Intervention for 6 weeks.  These students do not exit the intervention until they read they appropriate reading  level.   LLI is a small-group, supplementary intervention program in English designed for young children and ENL's who struggle  with reading and writing as they acquire the English language. In grades K-2, all the teachers are trained in Reading  Reform.  Students are taught the written form of the sounds of English, which they then put into works.  As the students write  the words, they learn rules that govern English.       9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      As a PROSE school, lab-sites will be conducted every Monday for teachers.  Select students will participate each Tuesday so  teachers could practice their craft and strengthen the curriculum.  After each lab-site cycle, parents are invited to observe and  practice skills and strategies demonstrated by the teachers on each grade level.  Teachers on each grade level will use data to  determine their grades' weakness and create a plan to practice strategies during the lab-site with selected students.     Touch Math will be implemented in Pre K, grades K – 2,  12-1-1 classes as well as Grade 3 ICT classes.   It is an extensive set of  supplemental multisensory materials designed for intervention and remediation. It gives every student the opportunity to  build a solid math foundation, regardless of learning style.  Whether they learn by seeing, saying, touching or hearing, they can  understand basic concepts almost instantaneously.   It is a supplemental program based on the Touch Math Touch Point  approach with step-by-step scaffolding and presents new skills in ways that always progress from the concrete to the pictorial  and, finally, to the abstract. Whether students still need the Touch Points and visual cues or are ready to leave them behind,  this program accommodates all learning styles as it takes students to the next level of math competency.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54      10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   Our school is currently not discontinuing our Dual Language bilingual program.     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  ELLA is an afterschool program for 30 grade 1 ENL's and/or ENL-SWD and 30 grade 2 ENL's or ENL-SWD students.  It takes place  on Wednesdays and Thursdays.    Using the NYSESLAT data, 60 applications will be given to ENL's (priority for Entering,  Emerging and Transitioning ENL's).  ELLA will use On Our Way to English  a comprehensive English language development  program that provides everything teachers need for effective instruction. Domain-based instruction includes a focus on  academic language and vocabulary development; thematic, content-based instruction; differentiated instruction for language  and literacy; and a daily instructional routine in oral language, reading, and writing.  ENL's who are entering, emerging and  transitioning are offered to attend the ELLA (English Language Learner Academy) afterschool program.  If there are available  seats, then it is offered to ENL's that are expanding and then commanding level.     Gr 3 - 5 Literacy and Math Common Core Afterschool  program is afforded to ENL's on Wednesdays and Thursdays.  The  teachers in Stand-alone ENL and Dual Language classes use data from assessments to select ENL's to participate in the  afterschool program.  The afterschool program targets English language acquisition in Reading (all content area), Writing and  Math.    Gr 3 - 5 Saturday Common Core Academy program will also be afforded to ENL's.  The teachers from Stand-Alone ENL and Dual  Language classes will use the data from assessments to select students for this program.  The program emphasizes English  language acquisition and vocabulary support in Reading, Writing and Math       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  Our school purchased Pathblazer which is web-based math and ELA curriculum designed around animated video lessons for all  students in K - 8 who are working below grade level. The program sets students on individual learning paths through both  built-in and external diagnostics.  Students begin by taking an initial diagnostic to determine their specific skill and concept  gaps. Students are then assigned a personalized learning path that aligns to their highest level of performance. Students are  engaged in scaffold lessons designed around engaging videos, animation and audio. As students get questions wrong, they  review the misunderstood concepts through a different medium than they were originally presented. Teachers receive real- time data on student progress and comprehension that they can use to inform instructional decisions.    Max Scholar is an on-line reading program that is research-based highlighting strategy to improve reading comprehension skills  in a multi-sensory approach. ENL's who are entering and emerging are selected to participate in this program during Morning  School on Tuesdays and Fridays from 7:15 – 8:15 a.m. as well as on Mondays from 2:40 - 3:40 p.m    Brain POP is a group of educational websites with over 1,000 short animated movies for students in Grades K – 12 covering  subjects of science, social studies, English, mathematics, engineering, technology, health, and arts and music.  Brain POP is  great at reinforcing skills and concepts students are learning.       13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Stand alone ENL classrooms, books from different countries that are written in the students' home language are available  in classroom libraries.  ENL teachers uses visuals and TPR to provide language acquisition in English and illicit vocabulary in the  students'  home language to develop vocabulary. (e.g., Count 1 - 10 in English, Spanish, Bengali, Fulani & etc).      In DL classrooms, half of the library includes English literature and the other half in Spanish.  Cognates (English/Spanish) is one  way to  support home language as well as visuals and Spanish dictionaries.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    In Stand alone ENL classrooms, books from different countries that are written in the students' home language are available in  the classroom library.  ENL teachers uses visuals and TPR to provide language acquisition in English and illicit vocabulary in the  students'  home language to develop vocabulary. (e.g., Count 1 - 10 in English, Spanish, Bengali, Fulani & etc).     In DL classrooms, half of the library includes English literature and the other half in Spanish.  Cognates (English/Spanish) is one  way to  support home language as well as visuals and Spanish dictionaries.       15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    We currently do not share a building (collocation).    If we did then each school in the building will form a Shared Space Committee to share and/or coordinate efforts to ensure  that all of the ENLs' needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met.  The building will have a uniformity of school-wide  discipline and expectations.  There will be an implementation of a single bell schedule as well as shared space schedule.  We  will coordinate the meetings of BRT and School Safety Committee. Each school would have equitable access to the DOE’s  resources including common space.  Each student will have equitable access to all shared educational resources and  services.  The committee and parent coordinators will plan and implement joint parent workshops or gatherings so families  and students have every opportunity to work and learn as a community within the building.  Bilingual staff members may  provide interpretation services during meetings and workshops.     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   There are a variety of activities in our school to assist newly enrolled ENL's before the beginning of the school year.  After early  registration, parent orientations are held for new enrolled ENL's and their parents prior to September.  A school walk-through  is provided after the orientation to familiarize both students and parents with the school procedures, setting, teachers,  curriculum, program options (ENL, TBE or DL), assessments and expectations.  Then in September and May, there will be  Family Curriculum Night to explore and learn more about the grade's curriculum as well as next year grade's curriculum.  The  parent coordinator will have an open line of communication with all parents including ENL's by providing workshops regularly  in the areas related to ENL's, testing, Cookshop & etc.        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    In our school, the language electives that are offered to ENL's is Spanish.        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)?  Explain how much of the  instructional day (%) EPs and ELLs are integrated.    There are two Dual Language models used in our school:  self-contained and side-by-side model.    In the side-by-side model, the students receive their instruction in English and the other instruction in  their target language.  The language use for content area (Math, Science & SS) alternates from day to   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56         day.  Students learn to read and write in and receive instruction in other disciplines in both  languages.  However, the emergent literacy is dedicated to the rules and concepts of each language  (English & Spanish).  The primary acquisition is the development of grade-level-bilingual and biliterate  academic skills in both English and the target language (Spanish) for all students. 50% of ENL's and 50% of  English proficient students are integrated.    The language use for content area (Math, Science & SS) alternates from day to day.  The self-contained  model continue to develop students' home languages as well as English language skills.  Bilingual teachers  teach all content area courses in the home language and in English.  The home language arts component  is taught to develop skills in speaking, listening, reading and writing in the student's home language,  which cultivates an appreciation of their history and culture.  50% of ENL's and 50% former ENL's/English  proficient students.  Kindergarten,  Grade 1 & 2:  30% integrated and Grade 3, 4, 5:  20% integrated      b.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?    Math, Science and SS is taught in NLA.  Unit assessments are used to determine the students' proficiency  in the content areas as well as in reading and writing skills.    c.  How is each language separated for instruction?    ELA is separated for instruction to support English language acquisition and vocabulary support.  Running  records are used to determine the students' level in reading for English and Spanish.    d.  Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages  taught at the same time (simultaneous)?    Emergent literacy is taught in the child's native language in kindergarten and grade 1.  Grades 2-5 it is  taught simultaneously.       Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?   There are a variety of on-going professional development workshops offered to all personnel.  All personnel are supported  through participating in Professional Development workshops conducted by DELLSS,  TCRWP as well as in-house professional  development (e.g. Chancellor Days, Lunch & Learns and etc) in an effort to improve instruction for all our ENL's.  When a staff  member attends a workshop relating to servicing ENLs, the staff returns to the school and turn-keys the information for all  personnel in the school.  Some members also participate in SDE (Staff Development for Educators) conferences and turn-key  the information for the entire personnel.  Members of the Committee of Special Education attend workshops as well as turn- key Special Education information regarding IEPs, SESIS and referral process requested by administrators.  Secretaries continue  to attend training and workshops requested by administrators.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57           Our school uses Teacher's College Reading & Writing Project as our ELA and content area curriculum for Grades K through  5.  As a result, there are many one-day workshops that are offered during the school year.  Each workshop is aligned with  Common Core Learning Standards.  Teachers are able to attend these workshop throughout the year.  Some of the workshops  include "Tapping into ENLs' Cultural & Linguistic Backgrounds in the Literacy Curriculum," "Supporting ENL's As They Learn to  Tackle Higher Level Texts, Develop Stronger Comprehension skills,  Take Ownership of their Learning in Reading  Workshop," "Shared Reading to Support Language Development, Speaking and Listening Standards, Comprehension and Word  Solving in Fiction and Informational Texts for ENLs."  After each workshop, teachers turn-key the information to the staff  (including guidance counselor, members of CSE & paraprofessionals during Lunch and Learns, Faculty Conferences, Grade  Meetings as well as during Chancellor Days.  The ENL/Dual Language Coordinator will provide ENL workshops (e.g., UDL, ENL  strategies, Effective Instruction for ENL's using an RTI approach, New NYSESLAT proficiency levels & etc).     2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  All teachers and paraprofessionals are given a minimum 15% of total  hours of ENL training with the exception of 50% hours for  bilingual education.  The on-going training can include professional developments through attending workshops from OELL,  TCRWP  as well as in-house workshops from certified ESOL teachers using ENL methodologies.  New teachers will retain copies  of professional development workshops too. A file that includes ENL training certificates is placed in the office and the number  of completions is recorded and updated annually.            Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Teachers set up meetings with parents on an individual basis.  The school sends out Progress Reports to parents discussing the  needs of their child in all content areas.  Teachers set up meetings with parents to find ways to assist and support them if a  student is Promotion-in-Doubt  If translators are needed, on-site translators will be available.  If not, over-the-phone  translation services will be utilized.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   Research shows the multiple benefits that result when parents are actively involved in their children’s education.  The  relationship between our school and our family is the backbone of our community.  Our parents are actively involved in their  children’s educational careers.  In our school we have an open door policy in the classrooms so our parents participate in  activities including curriculum night, parent orientations (fall & spring) , luncheons, workshops (e.g. Homework help, NYS ELA &  Math test & etc), assembly programs, art & literacy fairs, science fairs, field trips, membership to leadership committee, an  active P.T.A., Cookshop for parents (parent coordinator liason), volunteers and the foster grandparents program.  Parents in  need of translation services will be available upon request prior to the engagement of activities via notices or use over-the- phone translation service.  Parents are invited to Winter and Spring Concerts, Awards Ceremony, Multicultural Week (Cinco de  Mayo, Dance Festivals) and Soccer tournaments  The parent coordinator is available during the school wide activities to assist  parents as well as resolve matters.  The parent coordinator also conducts parent workshops (e.g., Cookshop for Parents,  Schoolnet & etc.)           2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58      Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Elisa Brown, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to  and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   P.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Various sources provide our school with information about the different home languages of our students and our  translation needs for conferences, parent orientation and school notices, they include: Home Language  Identification Survey (HLIS); Emergency Blue Contact Cards; Home-School Student Information Sheet (teachers  give out to the parents); ATS system provides information of the primary language of the student (RHLA); ATS  system provides information of the Adult Preferred Language Report (RAPL); Parent Coordinator interviews;  Informal oral communication with parents and teachers as well as Attendance in PTA meetings.      During the enrollment process, the parents are screened and must complete the HLIS Questionnaire and indicate  their spoken and written language. They indicate and record their spoken and written on the Blue Emergency   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62      cards too. The pupil accountant secretary will record onto the ATS (RAPL) the adult's preferred language in spoken  and written language. The pupil accountant secretary will generate the RAPL report by class and give them to the  teachers so they could determine if their parents require assistance with translation services. The classroom  teachers also send out Home-School Student information letters which include address, telephone numbers,  parent's spoken and written language too.          2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     Language    Written Preferred    Percent Written    Oral Preferred    Percent Oral    English   Spanish   English   Spanish   Haitian Creole   Haitian Creole   Bengali           Bengali    55.6%   38.8%   2%   1.5%   English   Spanish   Haitian Creole   Bengali   55.6%   38.8%   2%   1.5%   3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at   least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,  French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.     From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, there is no language that  represent at least a 10% population of my school currently excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, French, Haitian  Creole, Korean, Spanish, Russian and Urdu.          Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services    1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be   distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.

Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of   a school emergency.      The school’s communication strategy to reach limited-English-proficient families in the event of a school emergency is  first and foremost, using the school messenger to send emergency alerts to parents. Next, classroom teachers created  ClassDojo accounts with parents which can privately message each other without exchanging phone numbers.  ClassDojo allows parents to translate messages into any language, on any device with just a tap! Teachers also have  parents’ phone numbers in which they can text or call the parents of the students in their class.            Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure       Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and  what resources are available to meet compliance.      The Language Access Coordinator will train staff during staff conferences and grade meetings regarding the  Translation & Interpretation Units that supports NYC public schools in their effort to reach families who need  communicating in English. The Unit offers free translation services for schools and offices, free over-the-phone  interpretation for schools and offices and free on-site interpretation for offices.           Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services    Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive  information. Include any:     Translated signage    Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents    Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..)      The T & I Unit distributes multilingual posters to all DOE public schools and district offices throughout the City at the  beginning of each school year. The multilingual posters are posted in a highly visible location. These posters provide  LEP parents instruction on where and how to obtain interpretation services.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65      The DOE makes available to parents the Parents’ Bill of Rights and A Parent’s Guide to Special Education in the  covered languages. Both documents make parents aware of their rights to languages services. These documents are  distributed to parents at the beginning of each school year and can also be accessed on the DOE’s website  (www.schools.nyc.gov).    Our school will have multilingual welcome posters as well as language identification card so limited English proficient  parents can identify their language and/or a DOE staff person can identify their language as they enter the  school/office.   Monitoring of Multilingual Welcome Posters – Site visits to determine if schools have the required multilingual  welcome poster visibly posted at the entrance of the facility.          Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services  Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the  language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?       Our school distributes School Survey for Parents – Survey made available to all school-aged parents to assess their  child’s school, including whether or not the school is communicating with the parent in their native language. Our  school will use the data and the feedback from the survey from limited-English proficient parents to ensure and  provide them with oral interpretation services during group or one-to-one meetings. We readily have bilingual staff  members to translate and the staff can use the over-the-phone interpretation services.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66
