This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities    The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   Our mission at The Young Women’s Leadership School (TYWLS) of the Bronx is to develop a community of self- confident and innovative young women empowering them to be tomorrow’s leaders particularly in the areas of  science, technology, engineering and mathematics. We capitalize on the intellectual curiosity and creative spirit  inherent in all young women as we develop life-long learners who are armed with the skills necessary to successfully  complete college or any career readiness program and become productive members of society.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9                          2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.   Our school is located in District 9 in the Mount Hope section of the Bronx. We are excited to finally reach full capacity  as we enter our seventh year with our first high school graduation happening this coming year. We will have a little  over 540 students enrolled with approximately a 60% Latino and 40% African American population. Our school  qualifies for Title 1 with over 80% receiving free lunch. Our average class size is one teacher with approximately  twenty-seven students per class.   We believe all students can learn and simply need access to rigorous instruction in a caring environment. Through  thoughtful and strategic planning, teachers collaboratively create engaging lessons and activities to motivate students  to learn. Throughout the school year, we continued to work on our Standards-based grading initiative; this is our third  year implementing. We also focused on expanding our inquiry work in the 6th grade on executive functioning to a  school-wide initiative; based on teacher feedback, this is an exciting topic which we believe will best serve our  students. Teachers also refined their curriculum maps, further aligning them to city/state Common core mandates  and City-wide instructional expectations, needed for the successful implementation of standards-based grading. Over  the course of the summer we were able to secure a consultant to provide outside feedback to enhance teaching in  learning in all disciplines.   In Literacy, teachers used team-created units and other historically/culturally relevant novels in the middle school  while in the high school, a new curriculum was developed in collaboration with Teachers College using incorporating  literacy circles. In Mathematics, teachers merged teacher-created modules with Illustrative Math and Engage New  York with a strategic focus of using blended learning strategies to differentiate instruction while providing conceptual  understanding. In the high school, the teacher used the New Vision’s developed Integrated Algebra curriculum as a  foundation, including activities from Transitions into Algebra. We have been working with Algebra for All to vertically  align all curriculum maps. This will be a more targeted focus for the upcoming year as well as examining a conceptual  based math program in the middle school, Illustrative math to supplement the current home-grown curricula in math.  Similarly, Science, Social Studies, and all other content area curricula were developed by teachers; the high school  courses, Earth Science, Living Environment, Chemistry and Global 1 & 2 referenced the New Visions curricula initially  but have also morphed into their own home-grown curricula.   Last year we offered our first AP courses in partnership with AP for All & Computer Science for All to provide AP  classes in US History, World History and Computer Science; approximately 40% earned qualifying scores. In addition,  teachers have been provided professional development on incorporating Universal by Design by Learning strategies  into all unit and lesson plans. This has supported teachers to find multiple strategies to incorporate different entry  points for are special populations (approximately 20% special education and 10% ELLs). All students take Ed  Performance on-line assessments three times a year. Data is shared with all school members so that appropriate  leveled text can be incorporated in all content areas.   We consider who is in our classroom and how they learn first. Classes are interactive and provide opportunities for  meaningful exchanges that spark intellectual conversations and real-world connections. The process of learning  includes, across all content areas, opportunities for critical thinking, reading, and writing mixed with personal  moments, and fun. School-wide instructional practices, such as Kagan cooperative learning structures have enhanced  our ability to engage; we now move towards growing in our cognitively engaging activities and questions. We monitor   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10      how our students’ progress using data to guide instruction and provide further support as students strive to  demonstrate mastery. Towards this end, all new members to our community participate in a week-long orientation  program the last week of August to ensure that they understand our school expectations, procedures and culture.  During this time, we also provide pedagogical support around lesson and unit planning, with a particular focus on  Domains 1 and 3.    Additionally, this is our third year partnering with Writing Revolution (a.k.a. Hochman), with it being our second year  as a "High Impact Partner" meaning that we have more professional development and internal support. This program  provides PD that enhances students' writing and critical thinking skills. This is being implemented is Science, English  and Social Studies classrooms to provide coherence across classrooms. Our preliminary data around standardized  assessments, especially extended responses, indicates that our efforts using Hochman strategies are working.    The use of data to guide instruction more directly continues to be an area of focus for us this year. Based on feedback  from our Quality Review and PPO visits, we are targeting checking for understandings and how to effectively and  immediately impact instruction. We have a peer instructional teacher from AP for All and self-funding one as well.    Other such opportunities have supported teacher growth, and ultimately student growth. By partnering with Teachers  College Inclusive Classroom Program (TCICP), we have an additional coach 20 times a year that provides one-on-one  coaching cycles. Our Power My Learning grant provides a weekly consulting supporting our teachers in this self- generated initiative that utilizes blended learning as a means to reach all students at their respective point of entry  and/or challenge. In watching the 6th grade math team use technology more effectively, others have been moving  moving towards blended-learning. Learning becomes organic with teachers learning independently and volunteering  to teach their peers by hosting Lunch and Learns or sharing best practices at the end of our inquiry cycles, TYWLS Got  Talent.    Our partnerships with various organizations help us create a unique and distinctive community. Our strongest  partnership is with Student Leadership Network (SLN.) They provide us an abundance of connections that allow us to  enhance our educational programs as well as our after school programs; students have a safe haven from as early as  7:30-6:00 pm daily at a minimal expense to the school. They provided supplemental professional development for our  teachers, summer camp for students, unique opportunities such as a sleep-over in the Intrepid Museum. . New  Visions supports our school with weekly coaches, professional development and more. Our partnership with Girls Inc  allows us to offer nearly 30 different after school clubs and special programs a week. They allow us to do host special  events with additional organizations including other single gender schools and several Saturday activities; our  students and families genuinely appreciate the extended school day.   All TWYLS members are genuinely invested and passionate about our work. We believe that every child can be  successful and deserves the right to a quality education. We recognize the seriousness of our work and “imprint” we  leave on the lives of the young women we serve. We understand that the decisions we make impact their future and  the opportunities to which they will have access. We take this responsibility to heart.         3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   In general, our special needs population, which is approximately 20% of our population, have cognitive  challenges/delays and/or speech/language delays with a few exhibiting emotional challenges. To support their needs,  additional academic support is provided through mandated and non-mandated services provided by teachers/teacher  assistant as well as a school-wide emphasis to differentiate. To further support their needs, we partner with Include  NYC, which our students appreciate as they learn to take ownership and how to advocate for themselves as people  that learn differently. Because of our strong belief in the need to address personal and social-emotional growth, our  Advisory program (an events funded by our partnership with Student Leadership Network (SLN) provides various   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11      opportunities for CDOS hours which has been quite beneficial in having students meet graduation requirements.  Overall, we have had success moving our ENL students with all but a handful passing the NYSESLAT assessment.       4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   Our data at this time of year illustrates many successes in respect to student achievement. Based on our ELA and  Math state assessments, we made strides overall in both math and literacy. In ELA, 65% of 6th grade students reached  proficiency levels while 50% did in the 7th grade and 56% in the 8th grade. In Math, 31% of the 6th grade scored a  proficiency level with 44% in the 7th grade and 43% in the 8th grade. As compared with our 2017 results, significant  gains were made in both 7th and 8th grade mathematics; the 6th grade decreased. Similarly in ELA, the 6th and 7th  grade demonstrated gains while the 8th grade fell. Further analysis will be done once we have additional information  around state, city and district schools become available. In respect to the NYSESLAT, all but two students "passed out"  of ENL. Approximately 75% of our 8th grader students earned 4-6 high school credits and passed 1-2 regents exams.  Nearly all 8th graders took Living Environment and took the Second Language Proficiency exam with a 66% and 80%  pass rate respectively. About thirty students took the Algebra Regents with a 100% pass rate; 30% of the 8th grade  took the US History Regents with a pass rate of 70%. In the ninth grade, approximately 90% earned sufficient credits  to move to the 10th grade. In respect to state exams, 88% passed Integrated Algebra, 44% passed the Geometry  Regents, and 90% passed the Algebra 2 test. 94% of those taking Earth Science passed this regents, 80% of the  student passed the Global Studies Regents, 95% passed the American History Regents and 94% passed the LOTE  exam. The Chemistry Regents yielded a pass rate of 18%. We were also pleased with our qualifying AP scores: 33% AP  American History, 66% for AP Global History, and 30% for AP Computer Science. Although we would have been elated  by higher percentages, we recognize that the "real benefit" here is that we have nearly 1/3 of our high school  population taking AP courses. As research demonstrates, there is a strong correlation to exposing students to the  rigor of college level work in high school and their actual success in college. Finally, on the SAT exams, TYWLS Bronx  students have an average score of 966; the state average was 961 and the district average was 962.    According to the preliminary data from the 2018 Framework for Great Schools our school scored above average in  effective school leadership and collaborative teachers. In terms of supportive environment, strong family community  ties and trust our school still scored above the city average. This year our Parent Coordinator continued to partner  with Power My Learning to focus on parental involvement. The partnership also allowed the 6th grade teachers to  provide Family Math Playlists, an interactive math learning tool for students to complete with their parents. This  allowed for partners to see what the students are working on and provided them with resources for them to help the  student at home. Alongside our parent coordinator they are working hard to create more events that welcome  parents in such as Family Literacy night, family field trips, and Paint Night for parents on the weekends and after  school. This should continue to help our scores for trust and family community ties soar even higher.    We further believe that it is our responsibility to foster a sense of “family” for our students. Through our Advisory  program we create positive and trusting relationships with our students. We provide a time to develop strong bonds  within small groups with a 15:1 student to teacher ratio. This coming year, we have strategically partnered with Focus  on Freshman to enhance our 9th and 12th grade advisory programs to better provide students with the social- emotional and executive function skills needed for success in high school and college. SAT test prep is also  incorporated once a week through our partnership with A List in the 10th and 11th grades. Through a more  personalized relationships, we focus on distinct social-emotional and personal growth. We begin to embed the mind- set that we are preparing for college immediately with every grade going on at least one college tour per year  beginning in the 6th grade. As students progress through the years, they are exposed to more information about the  importance of college as means to access for opportunities, financial security, upward mobility. Students, and  families, are supported as they learn about the college process and become college-ready. An area of growth as noted  on our Framework for Great Schools, is that of student-teacher trust. We noted improvement since last year and plan  on continuing to work on this area.    2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12      In addition to the areas of growth noted earlier, we are looking to increase the level of rigor to be consistent across all  classrooms as a result of our work with advance placement course work. Our Advance data showed that we need to  continue to work in the area of instruction and have created our professional development map to target areas such  as questioning and assessment. We will continue our 6 week data cycles to further plan ways to target students'  individual needs.                2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13         School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot for 09X568   School Configuration (2018-19)   Grade Configuration   06,07,08,09,10,11,1 2   Total Enrollment (2017- 18)  English Language Learner Programs (2018-19)   465   SIG Recipient (Y/N)   Transitional Bilingual   N/A   Dual Language   N/A   Self-Contained English as a Second  Language   Special Education Programs/Number of Students (2015-16)   #

High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged  in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.   Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.  2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.     Through looking at the data below, we recognize that we must continue to push as the percentage of students at  proficiency levels can be higher. Our instructional foci for the school year is an extension of the work we have been  doing (which support our CEP goals):    (1) refining a coherent standards based grading revision policy with vertically aligned standards/rubrics for MS and HS   (2) spread the work we began with Writing Revolution across content areas and grades to enhance students' writing  with cognitive thinking with the mathematics department beginning implementation;   (3) improve school culture to foster an equitable and culturally responsive environment that is attuned to the social  emotional well-being of all stakeholders.    We believe that these will increase student academic performance.   In ELA, 65% of 6th grade students reached proficiency levels while 50% did in the 7th grade and 56% in the 8th grade.  In Math, 31% of the 6th grade scored a proficiency level with 44% in the 7th grade and 43% in the 8th grade.

We have allocated funds and resources to support  teacher learning. Furthermore, we have strategically increased school time to allow for supplemental time to engage  our entire school community in looking at student data. Nine times a year, we dismiss students early and allot time  for teams to look at student work and analyze data to address student deficits. This work continues in the classroom  as well as in other programs such our Saturday School test prep, small group tutorials with teachers, and/or  differentiated work for individual and groups of students.    In addition, we have been working on improved writing across contents with our multi-year plan for incorporating  Hochman Writing strategies in every classroom. this year many of the middle school and high school teachers  introduced Hochman Writing strategies into the classroom. The first year, the Literacy and Social Studies classroom  teachers were trained. The second year, science teachers were trained and this year we are working with Writing  Revolution to develop math-specific strategies to strengthen writing in the mathematics classroom.    School leaders consistently communicate high expectations (professionalism, instruction, communication, and other  elements of the Danielson Framework for Teaching) to the entire staff, and provide training, resulting in a culture of  mutual accountability for those expectations.

Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified  priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time- bound.   By June 2019, all teachers will continue to incorporate the use of rigorous texts and writing tasks into their unit plans  that will result in a 2% increase of students scoring above proficiency as measured by the NYS ELA, NYS Math exam,  English Regents & History Regents scores.      2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          16     Part 3a – Action Plan   Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies  your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for  this Framework for Great Schools element, including:     Evidence-based instructional programs, professional      development, and/or systems and structures needed to  impact change.

Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement  planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal.  By the end of February 2019 all teachers/guidance counselors will monitor and do an analysis of midterm/Regents  data in the four content areas to determine progress towards increasing the number of students passing/proficient  and/or growth as compared to baseline data to increase students on track for graduation by 3%. This data will be  used to determine next steps in subsequent unit/lesson plans. Data sheets are discussed in departments and tracked  through vertical standards throughout departments. In addition, all teachers will have a mid-year goal meeting to  ascertain students’ progress thus far. During this time next steps will be determined collaboratively with  administration. During this meeting teachers will have to bring midterm results to analyze student progress from the  baseline exam and identify next steps.   By the end of February 2019, administration will review data to determine the next steps (ie. Tutor/peer-tutoring  assignments; Saturday programs; etc)   By the end of April 2019, teachers of Regents bearing courses will administer a mock Regents to determine areas of  focus for test preparatory programs.     Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. (e.g. Performance Series, January  Regents, etc.)  The teachers will use teacher created data trackers as an instrument of measure to assess progress using  Performance Series, midterm assessments and/or January Regents. Mock assessments will also be used to drive  academic support in the classroom as well as test prep programs. The New Visions and their portal facilitates much of  this work at the high school level as well. In addition in monthly department data analysis meetings teachers will track  vertical standard progress across grades.     Part 5c.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment     Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and  formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not  limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.  Number responses accordingly.    1.

What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child?  In looking at our Learning Environment Survey for 2017-2018 we noted our strengths were in collaborative teaches  and effective school leadership. This data has varied slightly by year but has consistently outperformed the city and  the borough. We are also proud that rigorous instruction has been improving each year, which we feel is a result of  our vertical alignment work.   In continuing to review the Learning Environment Survey for 2017-2018, we noted some growth in ratings in  Supportive Environment over our previous year. As a result, we made some changes last year and we are happy to  note improvement, especially in Peer Support for Academic Work and Personal Attention and Support. Improving this  score to ensure our students feel supported in their learning is a priority for the year. Other subcategories ranked less  than 70% in this area were Preventing Bullying and Classroom Behavior. which will be a priority and the work will be  led by our dean and PBIS committee. In order to address this, as well as keep suspensions at a minimal, our dean is  going for peer mediation training. These are on-going priorities for the school.   In working towards this, we partnered with SNL to administer a social-emotional assessment. The survey provided us  with different data highlighting that students felt supported in respect to academics. However, we needed to focus  more holistically on student development.    As a result, we have now partnered with Focus on Freshmen; three school team members attended professional  development in June. We revamped our advisory program with a fully revised curriculum in the 9th and 12th grade.  For these particular grades, we ensured that specific teachers facilitated these programs. The guidance department  instituted a monthly theme in which they push into advisory groups, created a monthly newsletter for students and  families. Through an SLN grant, we also secured an additional social work intern that supports this work and allows us  to offer individual and group support after school and lunch time at no additional cost to the school.    Another way we are continuing to prioritize this work is with Mastery Collaborative, where we are working on equity  with approximately 6-8 teachers participating in professional development activities last year. As we continue this  work from last year, another cohort of teachers will attend the workshop.    We partner with Girls Inc for our after school programs at the middle school level. Working together, we are striking a  balance so that our after school program addresses social-emotional areas as well as provide academic support.  Towards this end, we have enhanced our PBIS program. Our Student Council has also helped create opportunities to  strengthen our sense of community which, we believe, has helped us improve in this area this school year.

Based on the 2017-2018 Learning Environment Survey, teacher collaboration is our strongest area with a 4.55 rating.  To develop this sense of community, we begin the school year with a retreat that focuses on team effectiveness and  communication. The work done with Algebra 4 All and other grants like Mastery Collaborative, have provided  additional opportunities to work together as we converted to standards-based grading and began to vertically align  curriculum maps in the mathematics department. Concurrently, our work with AP4ALL also deepened the level of our  team collaboration while highlighting the need to work backwards to ensure student success in AP classes through  vertical alignment of skills. AP4ALL also provided funding for a peer collaborative teacher to guide this work.

In addition on the learning environment survey 100% of staff stated that they trust the principal.      However, in looking at state test scores it is noted that despite outscoring the district in levels of proficiency our  students still need to demonstrate continued growth in order to be college and career ready. Another area of growth  can be found on our teachers' evaluations. The areas our teachers struggled with the most included 3b-Questioning  and Discussion and 3D-Assessment. Our ELA, Math & Regents scores will raise if the level of questioning increases and  the use of formative assessment used to drive instruction is used effectively and consistently.

According to the School Quality Guide , the element of trust has been steadily increasing which is viewed as a strength  in our school community. This shows that the parents trust both the principal and teachers with their daughter's  education.   Overall, we rated fair in Strong Family and Community Ties but are slightly below the City and District average. In  looking closer, we scored 42% in families feeling like they did not have the opportunity to volunteer. We have also  noted that parent turn-out has varied with high percentages (~80%) of parents coming for Parent Teacher  Conferences and Welcome Back to School Night and a low percentage actually attending PA meetings (~5%). Parent  participation at family events has a slightly higher turn out (14%.) This data is collected by the parent coordinator.  This was an area of focus for us and continues to be. Based on the 2017-2018 Learning Environment Survey families  overall trust teachers and administration (98%).    We will continue to focus on increasing family turn out to events while ensuring that we are clearly messaging the  many volunteer opportunities available.

These discussions start in department  meetings where baseline, mid year and end of year assessments are created and reviewed. At the beginning of the  school year members from each department volunteer to serve on the MOSL committee in order to make decisions  for local measures.        4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount  each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.  Program Name   Fund Source  (i.e. Federal,  State or Local)           1Explanation/Background:  Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and  programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and  advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.       2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39   Funding Amount  Indicate the amount  contributed to  Schoolwide pool.

In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.     2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. 09X568, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every  Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen  the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is  designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the  education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent  Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.

The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.       In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator to serve as a liaison between the school and families. The Parent Coordinator or a  dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the parents of children who  attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The  Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report  with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability,  grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and  technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42      the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and  allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● Provide families with multiple events to attend (ie: Family Literacy Night, Family Math Night, Science Fair,  Muffins with Mom, Donuts with Dad, Relay for Life, etc.)            Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association and Title I Parent  Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events (minimum of one per month)   ● parent coordinator hosts parent/guardian breakfasts once a week on Fridays   1.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Grade level reading comprehension skills of all our students are assessed using a computerized lexile level set test (Ed  Performance). The test is administered at the beginning, middle and end of school year. The data obtained from this reading  level assessment is used to determine the scaffolds each student will require in order to be successful in their content area  classes. Such scaffolds include but are not limited to leveled texts, custom graphic organizers, tiered questioning, small group  instruction and grammar intervention.   Additionally, the data from these assessments is used to determine student groupings  within each content area, in an effort to foster a collaborative learning environment.         2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49         The Ed Performance test is administered across grade levels at the beginning, middle and end of the school year. The data is  entered into a shared, living document that allows teachers to track student growth from the beginning to the end of the  school year as well as across grade levels.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  We use a combination of beginning unit diagnostic assessments, ed performance (as mentioned above) and end of unit  performance tasks to assess progress and mastery of grade level standards.      4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Inquiry teams meet to review all of the data outlined in point 3 and develop an action plan for tiered scaffolds and  interventions that are aligned to appropriate grade-level common core standards. This information is also included in our unit  plans and daily lesson plans to insure implementation. Interventions are done cross-content.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   N/A     6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   The ENL team analyzes the NYSESLAT scores along with state test scores (both New York State Assessments in ELA and Math as  well as New York State Regents exams) and classroom assessment, using ELDAT search functions and reports. The ENL  coordinator uses the ELDAT to inform the development of the ENL Co-teaching schedule and service hours for each school  year.      7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   Every year the ENL Coordinator uses the ELDAT to update a document that highlights the our ELLs and former ELLs testing  history and scores. This includes state test scores for both ELA and Math and NYSESLAT Data. This document is shared with all  teachers on Google drive and a beginning of the year email. Any updates that occur during the year are shared with  staff.  Having all of this data in one place allows for quick reference and highlights areas where particular students show  strength or need extra support. This data is used to determine which scaffolds or intervention strategies would best meet the  individual students needs. This includes but is not limited to grouping (heterogeneously or homogeneously, depending on  activity/needs), graphic organizers, adapted texts, leveled reading, small group instruction and reading/writing  interventions.  Furthermore, we use the NYSESLAT data to determine the minutes of service that each student requires as per  the CR Part 154.2 and develop the program accordingly.          Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   TYWLS Bronx is proud of its ability to maintain and develop excellent academic performance for its students.  In an  effort to support our English Language Learners, we adhere to the state mandates based on language proficiency as  identified on the NYSESLAT.  Our rigorous Freestanding ENL program is primarily a co-teaching (Certified ENL teacher),  parallel instruction for struggling learners in the content area of ELA. To help support our ENL students our classes are   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50         organized co-teaching classes determined by if they also have an IEP. This class has both a content certified and an  ENL certified teacher using various co-teaching structures.  Additionally, all content area teachers use the Universal  Design for Learning approach in planning and instruction. This enables students of all learning styles and English  language proficiencies to learn in an environment in which they are provided with multiple means of representation,  engagement, and academic expression.  The UDL model is one that works well for ELLs, in particular, because it takes  into account the ENL and SIOP instructional strategies. Such as, building prior knowledge through anticipatory texts,  visual representation of materials, verbal cues, repetition, posting of instructions, and collaborative learning. Our  instructional plan also calls for collaborative planning and curriculum-aligned support. The Literacy, Writing, and  Social Studies teachers meet weekly to collaborate on lessons and discuss additional supports, as do our Science and  Math instructors.  Additionally, all content area teachers meet four-five times a month to discuss curriculum goals,  performance tasks, and progress of ENLs in the various classroom settings. This year our ENL teachers will have  monthly meetings with our special education teachers to share best practices for our neediest learners.   All ENL students receive the appropriate units of study in ENL for their level of English proficiency,  as per CR Part 154.  Entering and Emerging ELLs at the Middle School level receive a minimum of 360 minutes of co-teaching(ENL  certified) per week, while Transitioning and Expanding and Commanding ELLs receive 180 hours per week from a co- teacher whom is ENL certified. Currently these services are provided primarily during Literacy, Social Studies and  Math periods. Additional supports are provided through parallel teaching and small group instruction during content  area periods.    Entering and ELLs at the High School level receive a minimum of 540 minutes of co-teaching(ENL certified) per week,  Emerging ELLs receive 360 minutes of ENL certified co-teaching per week, while Transitioning and  Expanding ELLs receive 180 hours per week from a co-teacher whom is ENL certified. Finally, Commanding  ELLs receive a minimum of 90 minutes of ENL certified co-teaching per week. Currently these services are provided  primarily during Literacy, Social Studies and Math periods. Additional supports are provided through parallel teaching  and small group instruction during content area periods.       b.  TBE program.  If applicable.     N/A   c.  DL program.

All ELLs receive the appropriate units of study in ENL for their level of English proficiency, as per CR Part 154.  Entering and Emerging ELLs at the Middle School level receive a minimum of 360 minutes of co-teaching (ENL certified) per  week, while Transitioning and Expanding and Commanding ELLs receive 180 hours per week from a co-teacher whom is ENL  certified. Currently these services are provided primarily during Literacy and Social Studies classes.  Additional supports are  provided through parallel teaching and small group instruction during content area periods.    Entering and ELLs at the High School level receive a minimum of 540 minutes of co-teaching (ENL certified) per week,  Emerging ELLs receive 360 minutes of ENL certified co-teaching per week, while Transitioning and Expanding ELLs receive 180  hours per week from a co-teacher whom is ENL certified. Finally, Commanding ELLs receive a minimum of 90 minutes of ENL  certified co-teaching per week. Currently these services are provided primarily during Literacy, Social Studies and Math  periods. Additional supports are provided through parallel teaching and small group instruction during content area periods.         3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.     ENL teachers and content teachers co-plan to ensure that our ENLs have the support needed to meet the demands of the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51      Common Core Learning Standards and to foster language development. Parallel, alternate and small group stations are  integrated into the lessons based on complexity of lessons and students’ needs. Co-teaching periods (45 minutes) are based on  the lowest proficiency level of ELLs in class. For example, in middle school, if the lowest proficiency level in a particular class is  entering, then the entire class gets a total of 8 co-teaching periods with a ENL certified teacher. If the lowest level is  transitioning, the class receives a total of 4 co-teaching periods with an ENL certified teacher. Similarly, in high school, if the  lowest proficiency level in a class is entering, then the entire class will receive 12 co-teaching periods per week.    The individualized and small group instruction models includes a variety of hands on strategies to include flexible grouping,  cooperative learning and scaffolding techniques in reading, writing, and math literacy development.  The parallel teaching  program more finely targets the needs of our entering and emerging students. It addresses the four modalities based on basic  interpersonal conversational skills as well as a strong emphasis on cognitive academic language proficiency. The balanced  literacy approach to reading and writing allows for a strong emphasis on vocabulary development through the use of  accountable talk, active listening, shared reading and the supplemental writing classes that meet three times a week. These  approaches include process writing, vocabulary development, cooperative learning, grammar language structures,  contextualization and use of technology. More specifically stated, it includes a wide scale use of vocabulary  development  builders, close exercises, comprehension checks, reading reinforcement activities, discussion starters, role play,  listening skills exercises, key grammatical structures, quizzes and tests appropriate to students’ grades and level of proficiency.  These strategies cross all curriculum areas and provide ongoing assessments based on the English as a Second Language  standards in literacy and social studies. Differentiated instruction is pursued through a well balanced literacy model.  The  Depth of Knowledge (DOK) elements are used on a daily basis during instruction.  Students are placed in various groupings that  include small group, individual, partner and whole group instruction, all heterogeneous.  There is also constant efforts to  attend to the individual needs of each student that is supported by a variety of instructional strategies.  Students are  encouraged to identify individual and group learning goals.  Accomplishments are readily supported through verbal and  written feedback.  In addition, all ELL students are provided instruction in all four modalities; listening, speaking, reading and  writing with the goal of increasing their ability to pass the NYSESLAT.  Long term ENL students are supported in the same way  but the grammatical language structures and vocabulary are more advanced. With such a diversify learning approaches ENLs  are able to discover language through experiments and process writing approaches.    The school provides 3 hrs in house of professional development to inform and educate the rest of the staff on how to service  their ENLs. Every subject teacher incorporates ENL standards to make sure their ENLs are meeting individual goals. The ENLs  coordinator informs all content teachers of the availability and location of the Spanish/English dictionaries for use during  instruction as needed.        4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   Currently the majority of our ENL students home language is Spanish and their Spanish Language assessed and supported  through our foreign language program.      5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.   Long Term  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status         6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   All school services correspond to ENLs age and grade levels. The ENL teachers meet and co-plan with the Literacy, Math, and  Science content area teachers to analyze data and ensure lessons are accessible to the students needs.  For example, in  Literacy and Social Studies, the ENL provider creates tiered graphic organizers, differentiates informational texts, based on  reading level, and front loads vocabulary using Quizlet, an online vocabulary study resource, and power point slides that   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52      students can access during independent reading of the class text. In addition, the ENL teacher procures audio copies of class  texts to facilitate reading comprehension. In Math, the ENL teacher supports the content area teacher in developing strategies  to enable students to better understand word problems. Such strategies include breaking up the questions, defining mortar  words, providing native language glossaries for brick words, and marking up word problems for better understanding. In  Science, the ENL teacher provides students with native language content area glossaries, sentence starters for scientific  observations, development of hypothesis, and graphic organizers to aide them during lab reports. In addition the ENL provider  uses experiential learning to deepen the level of understanding and internalization of new terms.    Furthermore, grade-team meetings provide a platform for large-scale discussions surrounding the holistic progress of ENLs. In  fact, English language learners are prioritized during the compilation of student lists for girl talk. During these meetings, the  ENL teachers address the needs of ENLs by providing content area teachers with additional resources and  supports.  Furthermore, we also diversify lessons through book clubs, writing tutorials, the use of pictures, Smart  Boards,  computer programs, and teacher created materials in order to make the teaching of reading and writing more  accessible and enjoyable to the student.     7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?  At TYWLS Bronx ENLs are taught in inclusive classrooms with a mixture of GenEd students and ENL or ENL-SWD students. The  classes are either designated as ICT for ENL-SWDs or Co-Teaching in ELA and Math for ENLs. All school services correspond to  ELLs age and grade levels. The ENL certified teachers meet and co-plan with the content area teachers to analyze data and  ensure lessons are accessible to the students’ needs.  Additionally, grade-team meetings provide a platform for large-scale  discussions surrounding the progress of ENLs. During these meetings, the ENL teachers address the needs of ENLs by providing  content area teachers with additional resources and supports.  Furthermore, we also diversify lessons through book clubs,  writing tutorials, the use of pictures, Smart Boards, computer programs, and teacher created materials in order to make the  teaching of reading and writing more accessible and enjoyable to the student.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.  For Native language students we provide equal access to all school activities, communications are provided in Native  language.  We provide native language content area glossaries when needed and implement the collaborative co-teaching  model throughout the content areas. More importantly, in ELA, in addition to aligning curriculum to grade-level appropriate  common core learning standards, we follow the Lucy Calkins TC Readers and Writers Workshop Model. In the 2017-2019  school year we fully impletmented the Hochman Writing Program across all grades and contents.  The program was successful  in fostering student growth in literacy, most notably in writing. In the upcoming school year the Hochman writing protocol will  be rolled out across content and grade levels.  Additionally, the use of thinking maps throughout the content areas provides  students with a streamlined approach to brainstorming that allows them to develop their ideas prior to writing first drafts,  revising, and editing final products. We also provide scaffolds as students begin to read on their own, which feature culturally  relevant text and close reading strategies, such as re-reading and predicting, vocabulary analysis, questioning and  paraphrasing. These assessments help to identify mastery of skills. Finally, as part of our Tier 3 Response to Intervention  Strategies, all students are assessed based on the Common Core Learning Standards, language progressive skills by grade,  beginning with elementary school language standards. This is done in an effort to ensure that students receive the necessary  intervention to allow them to perform at or above grade level and also the springboard the advancement of more proficient  ELLs.    In addition to the scaffolds and supplements noted above, our school used the Japanese Lesson Study protocol to help  promote data driven instruction that seeks to serve as the assessment, remediation, and intervention tool.  Through the lesson  study teachers use the inquiry model to collaboratively develop lessons that target the needs of all students, while paying  close attention to the needs of English language learners and students with disabilities. During the inquiry, ENL, Sped, and  Content teachers collaborate on a lesson, ensuring that all necessary scaffolds are put into place. Teachers later observe  students during the execution of the lesson and assess whether students were able to meet the learning objectives of the   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53      lesson. After lesson is lessons are taught and student work is collected, teachers meet in mixed grade team groups, during  Monday PD meetings, to discuss the results of the lesson and collaboratively plan interventions geared at pushing them  towards mastery of grade level standards.    Finally, for ENLs performing far below grade-level mastery, teachers develop small group intervention lessons geared at re- teaching skills and addressing misconceptions. Adapted lessons are also created, as needed, to ensure that SWDs have  mastered prerequisite skills before moving on to grade-level lessons.      9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      For the most part, the dominating trend among our ENLs is a disparity between their reading and writing levels.  While the  majority of our ENLs are native speakers and are making gains in literacy, their writing is not on par with their reading.  In order  to remediate this, we will be expanding the use of the Hochman writing protocol, which has proven to be successful with our  struggling readers and writers. The program was piloted in 6th and 9th grade ELA and was successful in fostering student  growth in literacy, most notably in writing. In the upcoming school year Hochman writing protocol will be rolled out across  content and grade levels.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   N/A     11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.  All school services correspond to ENLs age and grade levels.  In addition, ENLs are provided with social, emotional supports by  school counselors and other support staff. The effort to increase the students’ social and emotional development is provided  through informal meetings between student and ENL instructor conducted throughout the school day. Use of the ENL  Common Core standards supports our instructional planning to create optimal conditions for second language  acquisition.  Specific plans for extension of service for students  have also been developed to address  specific needs identified  among ENL students. Two such programs are the Saturday Remedial Math and Literacy program and the daily after school  homework help program.       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  As a school that is focused on fostering the development of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM), our ELL  population is afforded the opportunity to use various online tools to foster their growth and development, in all content areas.  Such examples include the use of the following:    Together these online tools provide students with multiple opportunities to interact with each other as they practice the use of  the written language. Additionally, on-line collaboration between teachers and students is also enabled through the use of  Google Drive. Finally, all classrooms are equipped with smart boards, chart paper for posting of additional  instructions/examples, laptops, desktops, and printers.      13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   Currently, the model is free standing ENL. In this model, the certified ENL teacher provides native language support through  the use of the bilingual content glossaries, thesaurus, and pocket size dictionaries, available throughout the classroom and in  the ENL coordinator library. Also, students receive translated letter sent to their home if teacher needs to explain news,  upcoming events or to reach out.  In the event that a DL or TBE program is added, students will be provided with native  language support through a combination of bilingual education in math and literacy and supplemental bilingual content area  glossaries.     14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.    All school services correspond to ENLs age and grade levels.  In addition, ENLs are provided with social, emotional supports by  school counselors and other support staff. The effort to increase the students’ social and emotional development is provided  through informal meetings between student and ENL instructors conducted throughout the school day. Use of the UDL and   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54         ENL Common Core standards supports our instructional planning to create optimal conditions for second language  acquisition.  Specific plans for extension of service for students have also been developed to address  specific needs identified  among ELL students.    Any updates on students’ portfolio or services are sent home with students to parents. These letter are always translated so  parents can also understand and ask questions if further explanation is needed     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    We are co-located with I.S. 117 however we are two separate entities in the building. During new student intake and the  administration of the NYSESLAT we share resources if needed.      16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).   All new 6 grade students participate in a mandatory, 5-day, summer bridge program during the month of August. During this  program, students are introduced to the school's culture and values, and are provided with an opportunity to build new  relationships with teachers and students in a relaxed environment.  Students who enroll after the month of August, are  provided with make-up sessions and additional support to help them assimilate into the culture of the school, without  undermining their own cultural background and values.      17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    We offer Spanish.      18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A     Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  All ENL teachers participate in multiple off-site PDs throughout the year and share what they have learning both formally,  through in-house PDs and informally, through co-planning and and curriculum and unit development. Furthermore, non-ENL  certified teachers also participate in off-site PDs throughout the academic year as well as during the summer months. Teachers  are responsible for maintaining their PD records in their personal files.       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  The school provides 3 hrs in house of professional development to inform and educate the rest of the staff on how to service  their ENLs. Attendance is taken at these in house PDs and teachers are reminded to mark down the hours in their personal PD  records.  Furthermore, teachers also participate in off site PDs throughout the academic year as well as during the summer  months. Teachers are responsible for maintaining their PD records in their personal files.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55              Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   In addition to the mandated parent orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences we strive to make  sure that the parents of our ENLs are in regular communication with the teachers. In order to insure this, the ENL coordinator  creates a document in which all teachers comment on the progress of our ENLs with regards to their language development  and specific needs for each content area. The ENL service provider uses this information to keep parents up to date on their  child's progress through in person meeting and phone calls home throughout the school year.    2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   At TYWLS we make every effort to create a community that fosters parent involvement. Throughout the year there are many  events held both before and after school hours that allow parents, students and teachers the opportunity to congregate and  take an active role in the school community. These events include a multi-cultural feast, literacy night, math night, science  night, muffins with moms, doughnuts with dads, father daughter dance and back to school night.            Additional Information   Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for  ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Lemarie Laureano, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are  adhered to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.   Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.    Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.   a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status.  If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish  LAB.   Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources  available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal- education-sife.   If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.   a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent   video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask  questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided  throughout the meeting.   10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.    a.   b.   If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program  in accordance with DOE transfer policies.  If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent  choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.     11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).   12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose   ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.        2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57                     Part VI: LAP Assurances   School Name:   TYWLS Bronx                                                                              School DBN: 568  Signatures of LAP team members certify that the information provided is accurate.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful  opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's  Regulation A-663).     By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and  interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).    Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English    1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written   and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:     Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)    Automate The System (ATS) reports    Student Emergency Contact cards    Surveys conducted by your school.      Pupil personnel secretary runs RHLA, RBIR, RADP, RAPL, and RADR to determine students’ home language,  language proficiency, and biographical information. In addition to this, the secretary also requires that all parents  complete a blue emergency contact card within the first 2 weeks of school. This information is then reviewed with  the language access coordinator to determine the languages spoken by the parents of the student body.            2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,   which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language  Report (RCPL) ATS report.     2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59      Language    Written Preferred    Percent Written    Oral Preferred    Percent Oral    English   Spanish   Bengali   Bambara   Arabic   French   Hausa   Soninke   TWI   Urdu   Wolof           515   232   6   .1   3   5   1   1   2   1   1   66.45   29.94   .77   .13   .39   .65   0.13   0.13   .26   0.13   0.13   509   236   5   .1   4   5   1   1   2   1   3   65.68   30.45   .65   .13   .52   0.65   0.13   0.13   .26   0.13   .39   3.
