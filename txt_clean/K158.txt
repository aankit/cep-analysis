This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the  school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools,  Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools.   Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect  the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms  where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity  and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and  classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more  attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and  Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our  families and students.   Strong Schools, Strong Communities   The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families,  educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school  prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.    The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers  and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of  schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students,  school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that  all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New  Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.    The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development   The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and  external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase  learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently  ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan  (CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school  community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and  address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for  students.     Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish  high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the  Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community  members concrete ways to improve.    In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in  consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to  participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a  comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7     the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all  the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements  work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing  that it likely addresses other elements as well.     The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools    Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards  are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical  thinking skills.  Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported,  and challenged by their teachers and peers.  Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools.  They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous  improvement.  Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff,  developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement.  Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by  welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations.  Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school  and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value  each other.      The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools   In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in  improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative  and qualitative data.   NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR)   The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by  coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality  Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The  Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:    I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2)  II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)   III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and   Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1)      School Quality Guide    The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to  set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to  accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also  available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s  practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information.  For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time.  The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of  similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set  based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide.      Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8     Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability,  professional development, and parent and family engagement.    To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in  improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will  serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the  administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish:        It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School  Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the  joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1%  parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1%  budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent  and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on  establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.   a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or;  a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC)     Next Steps for CEP Development   School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:      Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the   requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655.     Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability   status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year.     Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed   by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are  SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you  monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school  community know when you’ve reached your goal.     Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action  plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement.     Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I   schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC).     Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall   cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action  plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary.   Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful  implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to  accomplishing desired results.   Section 4: CEP Overview      1.  What is your school’s mission statement?   The mission of P.S.158K is to provide a collaborative environment between school and home and the community that  will develop academic achievement ,promoting critical thinking and support the social and emotional needs of our  students.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9      2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics,   including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.    P.S.158K is an elementary community school serving grades pre-K to fifth in the high-needs area of East New York,  Brooklyn. We have about 66 families who live in temporary housing.  Our target is to decrease our number of Level 1 and 2 students and increase our number of Level 3 and 4 students in  reading, writing and mathematics. Our mission establishes the same high standards of excellence for all students in  regular education, special education, as well as for English Language Learners and at-risk students.     We are a very unique school in that we create a welcoming environment for students, staff, and families. We have an  open-door policy, in which parents are welcome to the school to voice any concerns. We also encourage parents to  volunteer at special events and to assist with daily activities. Our school culture is very warm and child-friendly. The  staff truly cares deeply about the children and families in our school. Teachers stay after school to tutor students, plan  engaging lessons, and write grants. They go out of their way to contact and communicate with parents by way of  texting through kinvolved, letters, home visits and phone calls.     This year we have a few partnerships which are helping us achieve our school’s mission. We partner with City Year,  and East New York Reads in which corps members work with students in grades three through fifth in small groups on  literacy and math tasks. East New York Reads works with students in grades K-2 to support struggling readers. They  also mentor children who have challenges with behavior. Corps members stand by the school’s entrance every  morning as students arrive to school, with a cheer, to recognize and encourage good attendance. In 2014, we  received a grant from the Department of Education in order to become a Community School. We are partnered with a  community organization, Grand Street Settlement, to provide wrap-around services including counseling, medical  services, and academic tutoring to meet the needs of our students as well as their families. Our Community School  Director, who we hired through the grant, has spearheaded this initiative. We currently have on site a Mental Health  Clinic, Outreach Worker, Community Engagement Coordinator, Social Workers, Program Coordinator and tutor to  address the needs of students and families, with the purpose of supporting all students in their progress toward a  high standard of excellence, as stated in our mission.    As mentioned earlier, one of our school’s major strengths is creating a welcoming environment conducive to learning.  We offer Literacy Workshops,  field trips, holiday parties, and a variety of parent workshops through Grand Street  Settlement. We also implement extracurricular activities for students in order to encourage good attendance and to  get them excited about school, such as holiday dances, a co-ed basketball team, soccer, and a step team .The Parent  Coordinator also runs a talent show performed by students .Also the students perform in productions throughout the  year.   Teacher collaboration is also a strength, as we have a 45-minute block of time set aside each week for teachers to  meet, look at student work, and plan common-core aligned units of study. We also have professional learning  sessions on Monday afternoons, in which teachers engage in varied activities to improve their craft.      We will continue our initiatives to help to remove barriers for students and families , that limit success. We have an  on-site mental wellness clinic to support our families in partnership with Interborough Developmental and  Consultation Center. We will continue our partnership with East New York Reads, to promote literacy skills for early  childhood students.     However, despite our best efforts in trying to create a welcoming environment for parents and providing events and  activities to get them involved, we still struggle with parent attendance at workshops, Parent Teacher Conferences,  and meetings. In partnership with Grand Street Settlement, our Community Based Organization, we will continue to  work to gather information about parents and families in order to provide those activities or services that will  increase participation.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10        Another challenge we face stems from our transient population. As mentioned earlier we have many students in  temporary housing, which often means there is a deficiency in their academic growth. We also have many new admits  who enter our school mid-year, and are often two grade levels below. Also we have an increasing number of students  reading below grade level in the lower grades. Using small group instruction with a focus on guided reading and close  reading, we try very hard to bring these students up to grade level performance.       One more challenge we face is maintaining our level three students and challenging our above level students. We are  deepening our work with our on-level and above level students this year to ensure that they are challenged and that  they too, make continual progress.      3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are.   We have many students in temporary housing.   New admits who enter our school mid-year, and are often two grade levels below.   We have an increasing number of students reading below grade level in the lower grades.    Above level students who need greater challenge.    Students with disabilities make up 19% of our population.    8% of students are English Language Learners.   Students in need, especially those in temporary housing. In September we provide school supplies for these students.  Each November, staff donates food so that the needy families in our school, some of whom live in temporary housing  have complete Thanksgiving meals, with turkeys and all the trimmings. For the past few years, each of the over 500  children in the school received a small gift before the holidays.         4.   Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over  the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.   According to 2016-2017 elements of Framework for Great Schools ;the most progress were made in the areas of  supportive environment and strong family and community ties.   Through our partnership with Interborough Developmental and Consultation Center 30 students are now receiving   counseling services . Teachers have become more aware of the emotional needs of the students and have provided  referral services as needed. The social worker through Grand Street Settlement created support groups for students  who need additional support such as boys and girls student groups .We have added an Asthma Case Manager who  support families with students who are afflicted by chronic asthma. So far she has supported 14 families.      Through our partnership with Grand Street Settlement, many of our students and families were serviced through  academic programs, expanded learning time, health services, mental health services, and attendance mentoring.  Through our partnership with East New York Reads lower grade students benefited from one on on reading  instruction . Parent Workshops were held monthly on a variety of topics to help families develop successful students.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11         Based on the state math test, another accomplishment is that our scores improved by 7%.

What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?   Indicate the data trends, source and year.   Based on the Chancellor’s Equity and Excellence initiative we have integrated departmentalization in grade 5. This  enables teachers to plan strategically within their areas of expertise. This system affords students the opportunities to  rotate classes and work closely with teachers in a specific content area or to refocus on a skill deficit. Teachers, service  providers, and daily tutors plan together in order to work with students based on need, hence, providing them with  strategic instructional and/or social emotional support for individualized success. Additionally, this adult-to-student  ratio in classrooms provides students with daily small-group instruction that results in improved academic outcomes.  The sense of independence the students will get from changing classes will prepare students for their new middle  school environment.

Based on school parent surveys, P.T.A. attendance and a decrease in the number of parent volunteers we can assess  the need for more parent engagement and involvement in student activities at PS 158. According to school  attendance and lateness data, it is evident that students are missing a lot of instruction and this will become a barrier  to learning. We must inform parents as to the importance of attendance and being punctual. As a result, we are  working with Grand Street Settlement as our C.B.O. to implement a more productive and active program to motivate  parent participation and engagement in our school. At our Community School Forum, parents voiced the need for  support in homework help, especially in math. We will implement a homework help workshop series to better equip  parents to help their children at home.

TA Coordination with the Regular Program   Describe the planning, coordination and support of the TA program with the regular educational program (i.e.,  providing ELT, accelerated, high-quality curriculum, including applied learning; and minimize removing children from  the regular classroom during regular school day).   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33       N/A                Part 4: SWP Schools Only   4a. Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)    Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary  school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early  intervention services, etc.).  This year we are participating in a program called Transitioning to Kindergarten, which will help our pre-k families get  their children ready for kindergarten. The program includes workshops for parents and teachers of pre-k, on how to  prepare the children for their next step. A big part of this program includes a screening for teachers and parents to  see where students are in terms of early literacy skills. This program also includes sharing screening results and  records with kindergarten teachers, so they will know the strengths and weaknesses of each child.   Our pre-k units of study are also aligned to the Pre-K Foundation for the Common Core, which prepares our children  to meet the rigorous Common Core standards in kindergarten and beyond. In June, pre-k teachers also read stories  about kindergarten to the children, visit kindergarten classes with them, and bring them to the cafeteria to eat lunch,  so they get an idea of what kindergarten is like.    Our pre-k social worker also gives workshops to parents in May to give them suggestions to help them prepare their  children for kindergarten.         4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments   Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate  multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to  improve instruction.     The Measures of Student Learning Committee met in September to choose beginning and end of the year local  assessments for each grade level from kindergarten through five. This Committee was comprised of teachers in upper  and lower grades, a Cluster teacher, and the school’s administration.    Each week the principal meets with the grade leaders. This group makes decisions on assessments to be used based  on feedback from teachers. Teachers on each grade level discuss which assessments work for their grade in their 90- minute blocks of planning time as well. Our school data specialist and administration have given professional  development sessions on using data to inform instruction. Furthermore, the 90-minute planning block for teachers is  often used to look at student work and help teachers come up with strategies for helping students progress.         4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools   Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and  Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible  for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide  plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the  consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and  purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,  and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34      each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the  intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools  may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal,  State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This  gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.      Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a  single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual  identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool  to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds  used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from  which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to  combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used  conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the  dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.     Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages:     Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program   separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different  sources when accounting for their use.     A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the   statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g.,  semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent  and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended  beneficiaries are met.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35       2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as  follows:     Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to  improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes  provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH).     Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement   plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs      Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in   grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not  available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional  program.     Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English,  develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and  achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another  purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high- quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in  effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the  participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language  instruction programs.     Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of   English language acquisition and content area achievement.     Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated:     Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and  programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent  representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities  funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with  student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.  IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education  designed to meet their individual needs.        Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by   the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.         2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36      Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)     (Required for All Title I Schools)      Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and  representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will  participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I  program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson  that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the  parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school  will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic  achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family  Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility.    The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current  S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent  Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent  involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen  family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.     Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample  Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements)  as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.       Parent and Family Engagement Policy   Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.  The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of  parents and community in the school. P.S.158K, The Warwick School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I,  Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement  policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The  school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in  support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership  Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school  community.       Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students   P.S.158K, The Warwick School , will support parents and families of Title I students by:      ● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g.,  literacy, math, and use of technology;   ● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision  making in support of the education of their children;   ● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor  their child’s progress;   ● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37      ● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in  languages that parents can understand;   ● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other  members of the school community;         Parental Involvement and School Quality   The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all  parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The  school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement  policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school  surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and  enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.    In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the  school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership  Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for  additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:   ● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I  program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title  I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;   ● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;   ● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as  described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;   ● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent  Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support  and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;    ● maintain a Parent Coordinator to serve as a liaison between the school and families. The Parent Coordinator and  Grand Street Settlement and City Year will also serve as a liaison between families. The Parent Coordinator in  collaboration with Grand Street will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the parents of children  who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents.  The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents each month and file a  report with the central office.;   ● conduct parent workshops in collaboration with Universal Literacy Coach with topics that may include: parenting  skills, understanding educational accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy,  accessing community and support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at  home;    ● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review  Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38      ● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of  children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in  the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable  sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act;   ● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning  or evening ie parent empowerment time on Tuesdays 2:30-3:30pm to share information about the school’s  educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions;   ● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;    ● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and  workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;         Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement   The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:      ● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;   ● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;   ● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher  Association) and Title I Parent Committee;   ● supporting or hosting Family Day events;   ● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents;   ● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;   ● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their  children’s progress;   ● developing and distributing school information via Kinvolve and Skedula designed to keep parents informed about  school activities and student progress;   ● providing school folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format, and to the  extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

Community  Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and  family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in  Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health &  Wellness.    Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s)   How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student  academic outcomes?   The CS provides academic tutoring and parent workshops on providing academic support at home and how to support  students with different learning needs. In addition, the CS provides health and mental health services, which include a  SBMHC, in-class yoga and meditation, student counseling support groups, vision and dental screenings, asthma case  management, and teacher trainings for supporting classroom management and understanding student triggers and  stressors. The CS also offers various family support services, such as benefit screenings, housing assistance, and  employment assistance referrals. Having an array of in-house services and referrals to community partners has helped  reduce the percentage of chronically absent students, therefore increasing the amount of instructional time students  receive. As of June 28 2018, the number of chronically absent students in school year 2017 - 2018 was 6% higher in  comparison to school year 2016 - 2017.         Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to  be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.    Goal 1: By June 2019, 95% of all teachers will implement data driven, small group instruction in ELA and Math in all  grades in order to improve the school's Student Achievement Target from 27.7% to 49%.      Goal 2: By June 2019, 99% of our students and families will be engaged, serviced and supported by different programs  provided through the CS.      Goal 3: By June 2019, we will increase the number of parents who attend workshops and parent engagement  activities to 15%.      Goal 4: By June 2019, 90% of students who need social emotional and mental health support will receive services.  Student selection will be based on teacher observation, attendance data, and academic portfolios.      Goal 5: By June 2019, we will reduce overall chronic absenteeism by 3% compared to school year 2017 – 2018.          Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Community School Annual Goal(s):  How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family  Engagement, and Health & Wellness--support your academic goals for students?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44      Goal 1: The CBO will host and support school wide events where parents will be informed of reading strategies and  skills for students in order to strengthen the home school connection such as, family literacy night, taste for the test,  open house, and other parent workshops. Events will be held by the CBO in collaboration with the Parent  Coordinator, Librarian, and other school partners. Teachers will also inform parents of student progress during weekly  Parent Engagement Time and through progress reports.      Goal 2: Data from parent engagement events and student participation in ELT, academic, and health services will be  tracked in the data sorter. Correlations between student services/ interventions will allow the CS to address trends in  student attendance and academic performance.      Goal 3: In school year 2017 - 2018, we had 31 parent engagement events and an average of 65.8 parents attend. In  addition to Parent-Teacher Conferences, forums, and parent workshops, we will implement monthly workshops titled  “Teach Me Tuesdays” where grade teachers will work in teams to hold monthly parent trainings on unit topics to help  parents support their children at home. “Teach Me Tuesdays” resulted from parent feedback at our Community  School Forum, where parents voiced the need for support in homework help, especially in math.      Goal 4: Based on data from our community schools surveys, forum, and CBOs current data collection on services  provided, we have identified that our school population requires a high level of social, emotional, and mental health  support. During 2017-2018, 260 students received mental health services at our school. In partnership with  Interborough Developmental and Consultation Center we will continue to service students at our SBMH. In the past  year we have increase the caseload of students seen by the SBMHC by increasing the days of operation from 4-5 days  per week. In addition to the SBMHC, students will continue to receive support from the school guidance counselor  and CBO social worker who will monitor and support students as needed.       Goal 5: 215 out the 460 students we have attendance data for from SY 17-18 have improved or maintained their  attendance percentage in SY 17-18. Students who improved attendance increased their attendance between 1% and  77%. Of the 163* students we do not have data for from SY 16-17, 84 (52%) were not chronically absent in SY 17-18.  79 out of the 127 (62%) students were chronically absent. *We do not have data for these students because they  transferred to our school from another country, are Pre-K students, or Kindergarten students who were not enrolled  in Pre-K during SY16– 17. As of June 27, 2018, the percentage of chronically absent students in SY18-19 decreased by  4% in comparison to SY17-18. Reducing the overall percentage of chronic absenteeism will support our ELA and Math  Student Achievement target goal.

Describe how the school will partner with the Lead CBO to do the following:  1.   Community Schools are expected to partner with a community-based partner organization (CBO) and  together with members of the School Leadership Team, hire a Community School Director. The Director will  lead implementation of the asset and needs assessment process, and other critically important coordinating  activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work.  Community Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and  services, as determined by the asset and needs assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time  (ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the  right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly  coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day.  Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to  strengthen this initiative.  Community Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and  families feel welcome, actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of  their schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community  School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this family engagement  strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work.  Community School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director,  select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual  students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use.  Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work.   2.   3.   4.   1. P.S. 158 has partnered with Grand Street Settlement since 2014, to provide wrap-around services including  counseling, medical services, and academic tutoring to meet the needs of our students as well as their families. The  Community School Director (CSD), who was hired at the beginning of our partnership, has spearheaded this initiative.  We currently have on site a Mental Health Clinic, Outreach Worker, Program Coordinator, Social Worker, Success  Mentor, After School Program Coordinator, Tutors, Activity Specialist, and Group Leaders to address the needs of  students and families, with the purpose of supporting our entire school community.   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49         Our CSD works closely with the school administration to coordinate services and activities that best support the  school's needs. The CSD sits in on school cabinet meetings, SLT, and PTA meetings. At these meetings the CSD is able  to asses administrative, teacher, and parent needs and priorities. In addition to participation in school level leadership  meetings, the CSD organizes two forums to conduct a mid-year and end of year asset and needs assessment. Parents  and teachers come together to build communication, address school improvements, and highlight school successes.  In addition, stakeholders are given the opportunity to provide feedback at all community events. At P.S. 158 Warwick  the assets and needs assessment process is ongoing.       2. The CSD and CBO staff will work closely with the school administration, teacher, and parents to identify individual  student needs. Based on administrative and/ or teacher referrals, students will be assigned to either an ELT or health  or mental health service. Parent’s seeking services will be asked to meet with a CBO staff member for an intake  meeting. At intake meetings, a full assessment will be made to identify whether there are services that not only the  student that attends our school can receive in-house, but how we can support the entire family (benefits screenings,  adult education, work readiness, family therapy, and outside health services).      At attendance team meetings, CST meetings, and PPT meetings school-wide data will be used to identify gaps in  services, review attendance data for students receiving services, and which populations of students would benefit  from ELT, health, or academic services. As a follow-up, CBO staff will make phone calls to families of target students  to encourage daily attendance, receive updates, and remind families of the support services available to them at the  school. In addition to reviewing the progress of target students, new students who present needs will be examined.  At the end of each meeting student interventions will be reviewed and delegated to the appropriate CBO or school  staff . initiating new meetings, student progress and updates will be shared by assigned school or CBO staff.      All ELT services are coordinated before and after the instructional day. Health and mental health services are  scheduled with teachers and the school administration to assure that students are not missing key instructional time.  Student lunch times are also a key time when students are pulled for student support groups. When providing outside  referrals for mental health services we refer families to New York Psychotherapy and Counseling Center, with whom  our CSD and Social Worker have a close partnership. Due to this close partnership, our families are made a priority  and are able to schedule appointments during after school hours and on the weekend.      3. We will focus on building trust to create stronger family and community ties through parent outreach initiatives,  our parent classroom leadership program, “Teach Me Tuesdays,” trips and workshops. Through counseling, health  care, translation, higher education and housing services we will continue to encourage parents to visit the school and  seek guidance. We will also provide in-school benefits screenings. Family trips and parent workshops will allow school  staff to build a relationship with families, and in turn encourage them to participate in Community School Team  meetings.      CBO Staff will do outreach to engage parents and inform them of the services and programming available to assist  them and their children. Parent workshops will focus on finance, behavior management, mental health, child safety,  and education. In providing workshops for parents in-house we will build communication and trust with parents. In  addition, workshops will be made available to parents at times that are convenient for them attend. CBO are also   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50      made available to assist parents who require translation in Spanish. Translation services will be available to parents  during parent teacher conferences and PTA meetings where ELA and Math curriculum and programs are discussed.  CBO staff will also support continuous school programming that encourages parent involvement in student learning  such as family reading nights, summer reading initiatives, test preparation meetings, and IEP meetings.      Targeted students’ academic performance will be reviewed on a monthly basis by CBO staff.. After speaking to  teachers, cluster teachers, and specialist. CBO staff will either call parents or request a meeting to provide parents  with updates and possible supports if needed for student academic or behavioral improvement. After school tutors  will provide HW help and enhance reading and math that is done during the school day.      4. The Principal, AP, CSD, guidance counselor, dean, parent coordinator, social worker, outreach worker, SBMH  clinician, and asthma case manager will participate in weekly attendance team meetings. Attendance team meetings  will take place every Friday at 1 pm. The data sorter will be used to analyze School-wide attendance data to identify  individual student, and grade and class attendance interventions needed to increase attendance and reduce lateness.  Individual student interventions will include but not limited to the following: In-school one-to one or group  counseling, outside referrals to mental health clinics or health clinics, home visits, and enrollment in an academic or  enrichment service.

Explain data strategies including the use of the data sorter, and steps that the school will take to ensure that the   appropriate interventions are provided to the right students   1. The CSD and other CBO staff work closely together with City Year, East NY Reads and Interborough Developmental  and Consultation Center to provide students and families with year round in-school services.   Attendance and Parent Engagement: City Year provides attendance and academic intervention services to students  in grades 3 - 5. The CSD and CBO staff work closely with City Year to improve attendance tracking of students who  arrive to school late, provide a welcoming school environment with morning chants, and collaborate on family  engagement and attendance improvement events together. These events included: Attendance Improvement Dance,  Family Literacy Carnival, and WinterFest.   Parent Engagement and Academic Enrichment: East New York Reads works with students in grades K-4 to support  struggling readers. They also mentor children who have challenges with behavior. CBO staff and East NY Reads work  together to share strategies with parents about motivating students to read outside the classroom. Parent Workshops  were held monthly on a variety of topics to help families develop successful students. At workshops parents learned  about our literacy initiative and given resources to reinforce our guided and close reading strategies to deepen  parent’s knowledge and understanding. The CSD, CBO staff, and Parent Coordinator will continue to work closely with  East NY Reads to promote parent workshops and increase the number of parents participating in monthly workshops.   Mental Health, Attendance, and Parent Engagement: Through our partnership with Interborough Developmental  and Consultation Center 30 students have received clinical counseling services . Teachers have become more aware  of the emotional needs of the students and have provided referral services as needed. With the addition of the  SBMHC we have been able to make great strides. More than half of the students on the caseload improved their   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51      attendance this school year. 14 out of the 30 students improved attendance by 1% to 7% in comparison to the last  school year. For 2 out of the 30 students, we do not have data for the previous school year, since these students were  not enrolled in school. For 7 out of 30 students, attendance remained the same as the previous school year. 7 out of  the 30 students had decreases in attendance, mainly due to housing and financial instabilities that arose this school  year.      The clinician’s ability to build close relationships with parents and participation in spreading the message of high  attendance leading to academic improvement has led to increases in her student caseload attendance. Also, prior to  having the SBMHC, students were referred to an outside clinic. This caused student to miss days of school once a  week. In addition, parents would keep students home whenever there was a behavior problem that arose in school.  Being serviced by the SBMHC has given parents a sense of security that students are gaining the tools necessary to  self-calm and improve negative behaviors, hence sending students to school regularly. For SY 18- 19, we maintain the  clinician's caseload at 30 students being that the clinician's is there 5 days a week.      2. Community School Team Members   Audrey A. Wilson- Principal   Shirley A.

At meetings we will discuss attendance data, plan  and organize parent engagement opportunities, and invoke parent and teacher feedback to encourage school  improvement initiatives. Meetings will be organized by the CSD with the support of the Principal. The CSD will create  meeting agendas, send email and calendar reminders to CST members, send monthly reminders to all parents via  Kinvolved to engage more parents in CST meetings, and take notes to provide follow-up at the next month’s meeting.      3. The student data sorter is used on a daily basis by the CSD to review student attendance data. The data sorter  allows the CSD to identify gaps in student services and identify which interventions students and parents can  participate in to encourage increases in attendance and in turn academic achievement. For the past 2 years the data  sorter has allowed the CSD to track ELT, health & mental health interventions, and academic supports. 99% of  students during the 2016 - 2017 and 2017 - 2018 school year participated in an intervention. For the 2018 - 2019  school year, our goal is for 99% of students to participate in an ELT, health & mental health, or academic support  service.      Part 4b. Indicate resources needed including human resources, instructional resources, and schedule adjustments to  implement the Community School program.  The Grand Street Settlement Community School program model is composed of a team of staff that each contribute  to meeting the needs of the community school.

The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.   Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs.  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.     Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high  academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.   1.  2.  3.  4.  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on  the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”   1.   Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term  workshops and conferences.    Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet  community needs.    1.   These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.      NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional  development, and 20% to OTPS.       For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and  Performance Specialist.

What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP,   teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs?  Formative assessments/curriculum-embedded assessments use to guide instructional planning for ELLs are:  *  Fountas and Pinnell (K-2)  *MClass Running Records (3-5)  *NYSITELL  *Conferencing notes  *Performance Tasks  *Weekly Assessments  *Peer/Self Assessments     2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62         To support this effort, teachers plan, gather evidence continuously, and provide feedback to adjust ongoing teaching moves  and learning tactics. Specifically, teachers use learning progressions  to clearly articulate learning goals and carefully plan  learning activities and instructional sequences  and language use. In addition, the administrators provide support and  engagement structures to help teachers in the formative assessment process and instructional practice.      3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL   Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?  Summative assessments used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need are:*NYSITELL  *BOY F&P  *BOY MClass*NYC Performance Tasks        4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?    Flexible grouping within the classrooms, AIS, City Year Program.     5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K- 5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]   All students are first assessed to identify those who are not making academic progress at expected rates. Then, we collect data  from  Benchmark Assessments and compare growth. Then Intensive Intervention is provided to support the ELLs who are not  showing enough progress with differentiated lessons.  Students are then placed in tier groups of no more than 5 students to  track, reassess and regroup and this is ongoing.        6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs?   ([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].   *NYSESLAT*ELA/Math State exams  *Science State exam*RLAT*RFSI*RNMRPS 158K uses the EDAT which is a tool that allows schools to download 3 ATS  reports.  It then provides us a summary of our school’s status and students’ achievement and progress. The EDAT also allows  us to target instructional programs to accelerate achievement among both ELLs and non-ELLs.       7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?   In September, the data specialist, ENL teachers gather and analyze the data using the L2rpt.  Then,  the results are discussed and we develop an action plan that targets the ELLs' needs.  This data is used as a guide for teachers  and administrators to provide targeted differentiated instruction.  In turns, this data is then shared with teachers of ELLs in  professional learning sessions.           Part IV: ELL Programming     Programming and Scheduling Information   1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented  as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students  regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in  one class]).    a.  Freestanding ENL program.   PS 158K  offers a Freestanding English as a New Language push-in and pull-out methods as per CR Part 154.2   At the  end of the school year, the principal ensures that all students from a particular grade are all grouped in one class.  For  example, all first grade ELLs are placed in one class (heterogeneously).  The set-up allows the ENL teacher to smoothly  push in without interfering with the class academic routine.  Students receive the required periods of ENL based on   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63         their NYSESLAT and/or NYSITELL scores.            b.

How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each   program model?   a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2   below)?          The ENL program focuses on the push-in/pull-out method.  All ELLs in monolingual classes are being serviced by the ENL  teacher.  For the Standalone ENL, students are grouped by language proficiency level (homogeneous) for the necessary  amount of minutes and ELA instructional units as required by Comissioner's Regulations Part 154.   Instruction is provided  using different methodologies.   A copy of my mandated services is provided to the Principal and the  ENL teacher has the students sign in during each session.  The classroom teachers are also given a schedule that specifies the  amount of State mandated minutes of each student.  The schedule is posted in their classrooms.   Entering and emerging ELLs  receive 360 minutes of ESL services per week.  Transitioning and expanding ELLs receive 180 minutes of ESL services per  week.  Commanding and students who receive a 3 or 4 in ELA and score a proficiency score on the NYSESLAT  are scheduled  for alternative pathways to monitor students' progress.                3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and   methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core  Learning Standards.   Out of classroom teachers use a variety of techniques  to support learning and clarify meaning.  During math, the teacher  reads math questions aloud with ELLs, models how to solve word problems and encourages students to verbalize their  explanations.•The Social Studies teacher scaffolds his instruction with visual aids such as maps, cartoons and illustrations to  increase comprehension. •The Science teacher uses Amplify which blends digital experiences with hands-on lessons that  inspire students to think like scientists and engineers to solve real-world problems.   In differentiating instruction for Ells, visual  aids, pictures, graphic organizers and instructional charts are used to assist students throughout the lesson. Teachers utilize  peer tutoring, buddy system, and partnering to support students with independent practice.  Library books are available in all  subject areas both in English and their native language.       4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year?   Since 158K provides a stand alone ENL program, students are not assessed in their home language.  Only the Spanish LAB is  administered to those who are eligible upon registration.     5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?   SIFE     a.  b.  Newcomer   c.  Developing    d.  e.

What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic   content areas and accelerate English language development?   The use of technology-based website, starfall.com, Wilson/Fundations, readinga-z, Myon programs are being utilized to  accelerate English language development.    In addition, scaffolding, building prior knowledge and opportunity to engage in  meaningful conversations and discussions are being used.       7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and   attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?      Related service providers share strategies by attending professional learning workshops.  The information is then turnkeyed  to teachers of ELLs.  When students display rapid growth, meetings amongst the providers take place to discuss students'  progress and adequate placement in least restricitve environment that is conducive to the students' academic and social  needs.  ELLs with disabilities receive their required level of ELL services  To achieve their IEP goals, lessons are planned using  the goals from the IEPs and then are aligned with the standards.  Also, teachers use UDL (Universal Design for Learning) to  develop instruction that addresses the needs of our ELL students with disabilities.     8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups   targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which  they are offered.    ELLS who are far below grade level will be pulled out for small group instruction by the content area teachers.  These groups  consist of no more than 5 students.  Also ELLs and ELL-SWD participate in all afterschool activities.     9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?      01 classes were created to make pushing-in more conducive.       10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?   The bilingual program was discontinued due to low enrollment.       11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in   your building.   All programs are made available to the ELL population.  They receive physical education, social studies, science, throughout  the school week.  ELLs participate in soccer. They are given the same notifications in parents' preferred language as the rest of  school population.  All bulletins from school or districts are distributed in students' Native Language.       12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language   materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.  PS 158K uses a variety of materials to enhance language acquisition:*Ready* Go Math* MyOn* smartboard, laptops,*Bilingual  dictionaries/glossaries,*leveled libraries, *Readinga-z, Pebblego.com, Bookflix.*Leveled Literacy Intervention       13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)?   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65         In the ENL model, Native language is supported by peer translation, staff translation, use of translated glossaries and Bilingual  dictionaries and content area books.      14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.   Placement for our ENL students are chosen based on the NYSESLAT proficiency levels.  Their NYSESLAT proficiency level  determines the mandated units per week.  Then, students are grouped based on grade levels. All required services correspond  to ELLs' ages and grade levels.  All the ELLs have access to laptops, Ipads as an integral part on a daily basis.  Entering and  Emerging are given manipulatives, visuals and hands on activities.  Expanding and Commanding students are given challenging  texts and tasks to encourage oral language.     15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the   ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?    N/A     16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for   new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor,  parent coordinator).     Newly enrolled ELLs are invited to tour the school building before the beginning of the school year.  Parents have the  opportunity then to ask questions on different programs and activities that are or will be offered at PS 158.  The staff members  who are involved in such activity is the school counselor (M. Penaherrera), parent coordinator (Pamela Easton), and the ENL  teacher (Y. Louis).        17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?    N/A        18.  For schools with dual language programs:   a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day   (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated.  In which language(s) is each core content area taught?   b.  c.  How is each language separated for instruction?  d.   Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same  time (simultaneous)?   N/A        Professional Development and Support for School Staff   1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic   staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs  as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards?  In supporting ELLs as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards, PS 158K offers all personnel at the school:*A  process for integrating teachers’ understanding of academic content and English-language proficiency standards with  instruction in teaching methods and assessments.* Methods for implementing instructional strategies that ensure that  academic instruction in English is meaningful and comprehensible.  * Guidance on how to implement strategies that simultaneously integrate language acquisition, language development, and  academic achievement. *Understanding and appreciating students’ different cultural backgrounds. *Addressing academic,  social emotional and behavioral needs*Language Acquisition Development  All Teachers of ELLs:*Fundations*Guiding Reading/Vocabualry Development, Fluency and Comprehension*Analyzing Student  Data (NYSITELL/NYSESLAT,*EDAT*Deepening knowledge, understanding and application of Second Language  Acquisition*Strategies for struggling readers*Looking at Student work*Addressing academic, social emotional and behavioral   2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66         needs.*Differentiation for ELLs*Team Teaching Model       2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all  teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include  how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference  Guide, Professional Development section.  Professional Development for ENL Teacher50% of the total hours of PL are ELL specific for ENL teachers15% of the total hours  are for all teachers is ELL targeted.  The ENL teacher attends monthly meetings facilitated by District ELL Compliance specialists.  The information from the  meetings is turn-keyed to thee pedagogical staff.     PS 158K ensures professional development to all teachers and administrators that specifically addresses the needs of English  language learners. A minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the required professional development hours for all teachers  prescribed by CR Part 80 is geared to language acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and  integrating language and content instruction for English language learners.   For the English as a new language teachers, a  minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the required professional development hours is dedicated to language acquisition in  alignment with core content area instruction, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating  language and content instruction for English language learners.  The school maintains an agenda and attendance sheets on  record in a binder titled ELL Professional Development.       Parental Involvement   1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language  development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas?  Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent  orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?   Parental Involvement for Parents of ELLs:     At the beginning of the school year, teachers meet with parents or guardians of  newly enrolled English Language Learners to welcome them to our school community and the neighborhood.  At our first Open  House in September, we  discuss the types of assessments students will partake in throughout the school year.       Teachers  will also meet with the parents during conferences, orientations and scheduled meetings which take place on every Tuesday  during the Parent Engagement time.  These meetings will inform the parents about their child's language development in all  content areas.  Meetings are held in parents' preferred language using the on-site interpreters.         In addition, PS 158K schedules informational sessions and administration of the April  NYSESLAT exam with the parents or  guardians of ELLs.  These sessions  discuss the goals of the program, their child's language develoment progress, their child's  English language proficiency assessment results and language development in all content areas.    The Language Access  Coordinators (Pamela Easton, Maritza Penaherrera)  are available during these sessions. The following staff members are  available for translation services; school counselor, social worker, school psychologist and CBO Coordinator.       In May, another annual meeting with parents is scheduled to discuss promotional criteria and the summer enrichment  programs which are available.   2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs.   The newly enrolled parents of the ELLs are provided with orientations sessions to inform about the ELL programs that are  available.   Our community based organization (Grand Street Settlement) continuously provides workshops to parents  regarding  job fairs, health care, child care, food stamps, counseling and other services.  In May, another annual meeting with  parents is scheduled to discuss promotional criteria and the summer enrichment programs which are available.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL  Policy and Reference Guide, I, Latishia Towles, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered  to and staff are trained on the following:    1.   The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for  students entering with IEPs).  Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined  a.   If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status  relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.    The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.    a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services  are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality  translation service.     Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.    a.   If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility  to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent.
